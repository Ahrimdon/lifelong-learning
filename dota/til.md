Broodmother Offlane
- Bloodseeker with blademail
- Still strong in lane
- Really try to stick in your lane if possible
- Mirana Aghanims is hard

Disruptor Support
- MAGIC STICK
- Get out of a bad lane ASAP
- At some point you are just a free kill
- Buy wards on cooldown
- Hook psychology

Broodmother Offlane again
- Snowball PA effect
- Awareness
- Hitting centaur - don't go with brood, just the spiderlings since they will be stunned
- When many hitter type enemies, don't build orchid
- Force staff doesn't work on Slark leash

Juggernaut
- Possible to avoid neutral centaur and Ursa stun by juking before they stun
- Omnislash is only 3 hits on level 1, so must hit a non-tanky hero
- Hard to spam blade fury in the first few levels (it costs 90 mana)
- Omnislash costs 150 mana level 1 and 250 mana level 2
- Cast healing ward on the ground first

Winter Wyvern
- Positioning!
- Okay to get Splinter to get more farm

Medusa Carry
- Stack in the early stages so you have a comeback mechanic
- Really hard to kill after the Linkens as long as you are efficient in farming

Lina
- When you Euls an enemy, wait 2 seconds or wait for them to spin twice in the air before casting LSA
- Skill Dragon Slave first and Fiery Soul at level 4
- Before TPing out or after, you can do a Dragon Slave with the fountain regen so you move faster with Fiery Soul

Disruptor Support
- Kinetic field to see vision of high ground if you don't have ward
- Perfect the Glimpse-Kinetic-Storm combo

Nyx Assassin
- Able to use stun to initiate, not vendetta
- Just avoid going to woods to plant wards if you know enemies are probably there
- Getting better at Magic Stick but still almost always an essential for support heroes

Skywrath
- You can see Rubick stolen ability by clicking him
- Can't force staff through Kinetic Field

Elder Titan
- Euls-stomp combo, count 1.5 seconds
- Use the spirit to stomp
- Just stay in back, wait for someone like Axe to initiate, and follow the initiation with an Earth Splitter
- Get blademail if PA is there, Euls is not that effective
- Sage's mask not really effective for mana regeneration
- Natural order has a very small radius
- The stomp deals full damage if the spirit is inside you
- Clockwork battery assault has a ministun and you are basically a free kill for him
- Silver Edge = good against PA, Tiny, Abaddon (no Borrowed Time)

- Sniper is one of the most comeback heroes.
- Guardian greaves to get rid of silence
- Chill in their jungle when you're ahead
- Nyx/other supports - no need to show anywhere, your gold comes from hero kills
- Queue courier at 3 minutes to upgrade it ASAP
- Alchemist - Soul ring is good because Chemical Rage heals him. Then build Armlet, Radiance, Boots of Travel.
- Phoenix good with and against strength, with Void, and also sucks in rotating. You suck against escape heroes. Fire spirits are good against right clickers and the egg is good against casters.
- Clinkz can be played as a space creator that hunts supports. Soul ring means high sustain.
- Easy to gank from top lane (both Radiant/Dire).
- Venomancer is a fast jungler with his wards.
- Practice tread switching, it's worth it.
- From the side shop: Hood of Defiance, Vanguard, Blade Mail, Power Treads, Medallion, Phase Boots.

- Iron Talon: Bloodrage increases the Iron Talon damage, if you use Open Wounds on a creep then activate Iron Talon on it you lifesteal the damage Iron Talon did.
- Weaver can shukuchi during TP and it disjoints projectiles. Works with Clinkz and Bounty Hunter, Shadow blade, Glimmer cape, Nyx.
- Activating Spiked Carapace does not break Vendetta invisibility.
- CM: You can self cast Shadow Amulet , blink to a spot, and start channeling your ultimate. There is a 1.5 second window for this.
- Directional pathing: Hotkeys/Advanced hotkeys.
- Treant/Riki can use all of his abilites and itesm without breaking Nature's Guise.
- Witch doctor: Select the death ward then right click on a different target to change targets.
- IO will only heal a tethered unit when IO is missing health or mana.
- Riki: You can blink strike on enemies without breaking your invis by quickly moving or stopping your attack before you actually hit the enemy.
- Void: Time Walk towards enemy heroes to dodge their stuns.
- You can use Demonic Purge/Naga net on couriers.
- You can use TP when using Sun Ray.
- You can dodge X mark by using Nightmare.
- Abbadon's Aphotic Shield can dispel almost anything, same with his ult.
- Phoenix: Fire Spirits don't stack.
- SK: Stun your enemy so you end up behind them while you channel Epicenter, so they have to turn first.
- You can cast Juggernaut spin after initiating a TP.  He can attack buildings while spinning.
- Nyx: With level 3 Vendetta, the cooldown is equal to the duration. So you can use Ulti and strike again or finish your combo and make a quick escape.
- Oracle: You can use W after popping his spell shield so he can't attack you. Euls combo: E, Euls, channel Q when in Euls, then E again when he goes down.
- CK vs melee, you can stay in the back and when they approach for a last hit, use reality rift to get him to try tanking the creep wave.
- Warlock: Better to use Shadow Word as a heal than as a nuke. Golems do chaos damage so they suck against towers, just let them hit the next creep wave.
