- Learn 300–1000–3000 of the most common words in the language, along with an equal number of domain-specific vocabulary that will be helpful for you because of specific topics that interest you. In other words, about 500–2000–5000 words. Beyond that, you will be almost indistinguishable from a native speaker (at least for familiar topics). If you can learn 10–40–100 words per week, you can reach those goals within a year.
- **Learning vocabulary is, at least for me, one of the most challenging parts of learning a language. Fluency comes with practice and immersion and is more or less just a matter of time spent practicing. If you want to do well with that, just do it.**
- The most important point is that the distribution of vocabulary is not linear: in other words, words are not equally frequent, or equally valuable.
- You can recognize 7% of “English” just by knowing one word (the)!
- By the time you know 100 words, you will recognize over 40% of the words on an average page. By the time you know 300 words, you will recognize over 50% of the words on a page.
