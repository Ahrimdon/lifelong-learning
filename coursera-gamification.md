## 1.3 – Gamification Defined

_"The use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts."_

- Nike: Built a set of applications embedded in the shoe which turns your running into a game.
- Zombies run! Simulates you running from zombies

#### Game elements

- Traditional: Points, resource collection, quests, avatars, social graph, progression, levels
- Gamified: Same things: points, levels, points, social graph, badges, quests
- Game design techniques: there are more to games than elements!

Non-game contexts: Some objective other than success in the game (school, etc).
 
## 1.4 – Why Study Gamification?

It is an emerging business practice.

Games are powerful things i.e. "wow that was so addictive".

Lessons from psychology, design, strategy, technology (What motivates someone? How do you design better? What strategy works?)

Gamification is harder than it appears! We can't just add challenges and shit.

## 1.5 – History of Gamification

- 1912: CrackerJack toys in cereals
- 1980: Richard Bartle's MUD1: First text-based MMORPG
- 1980-present: Scholars (Thomas Malone paper on "what makes things fun to learn", James Paul Gee's "What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy")
- 2002: Serious games/games for change. These are full-blown games as opposed to gamification mechanics. Ex: PeaceMaker
- 2002: "Conundra", a UK-based consultancy firm that didn't really take out
- 2005-2007: Bunchball (first gamification company)
- 2010 Gamification reached critical mass: Jesse Schell's presentation went viral, Jane McGonigal alternate reality game
 
## 1.6 – Examples and Gamification

__External (marketing, sales, customer engagement)__: Club psych - avatars, rewards, leadership, badges, leaderboards, challenges.

Traffic +30%, Online merchandise +50%, Pageviews increased 130%, Psych content shared 300K, 40M users.

__Internal (HR, productivity enhancement, crowdsourcing)__:

- Crowdsourcing - internal because is in a community (not necessarily inside a company)
- Bug finding/languages in Microsoft: Different MS offices fought each other to have the best language framework - leaderboard etc.

4500 participants, Reviewed over 500k dialog boxes (!), 6700 bugs, Hundreds of significant fixes.

__Behavior change (health/wellness, sustainability, personal finance)__:

- "I know I should go to the gym, but it's hard"
- Police speeding: speed monitor devices which give feedback on their speed causes people to react (even if there are not policemen)
- Camera thing in Sweden where the fines of the speeders are given to the non-speeders = average speed decreased from 32 to 25 kph.
 
## 2.1 – Gamification in Context

#### Gamification is not

- __Not turning everything into a game.__ It is actually the opposite, we want to make normal things better and enhance those experiences for motivation
- __Not the games in work  in the workplace.__ Windows Solitaire - 9 billion hours used in 2003 (lol)
- __Not using games in business.__ McDonald's monopoly game, etc, not about changing the experience in McDonalds but its about using a game to make people feel like they're more willing to go to the store.
- __Not simulations such as surgery simulators.__
- __Not limited to marketing stuff.__
- __Not Game theory (this is used for strategic decision making).__

#### Gamification is:

- Listening to what games can teach us. Games are powerful and can teach us things.
- Learning from game design (and psychology, management, marketing, economics).
- Appreciating fun.
  
## 2.2 – What is a game?

Deep philosophical question lol

Ludwig Wittgenstein: _The word "games" were an argument that it is impossible to define  things using language._

Bernard Suits: "The Grasshopper" - we can every possible game based on three concepts:

- Pre-lusory goal: There is an objective in a game. (ex: pingpong = hit the table; race = cross the line)
- Constitutive rules: Set of rules and limitations that make the activity into a game (checkers: diagonal movement)
- Lusory attitude: Game-like attitude - the player follows the rules voluntarily (no cheating!). Voluntarily overcoming unnecessary obstacles.

J. Huizinga - "Homo ludens"

- Games and play are what makes us human
- Magic circle: In a game, there is a physical or virtual boundary that divides the world of the game from the real world - either physically (soccer) or conceptually (video game)
- Inside the circle, the game's rules matter. Not the real world's. 
- Put the player inside the circle!
 
## 2.3 – Games vs Play

Roger Callois - ludus vs paidia

Ludus = game, paidia = play
Play = Freedom

"Play is the aimless expenditure of exuberant energy."

"Play is whatever is done spontaneously and for its own sake."

"..,play creates a zone of proximal development of the child. In play a child always behaves beyond his average age."

"Play is free movement within a more rigid structure."
Games = Has Objective

"A game is a closed, formal system that engages players in a structured conflict, and resolves in an unequal outcome."

"A game is a series of meaningful choices."

"A game is a... domain of contrived contingency that generates interpretable outcomes."

"A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.
Takeaways

Voluntariness: you want to do this and you are not forced to join. "Whoever must play... cannot play."

Learning or problem solving 

Balance of structure and exploration

## 2.4 – Video Games

First successful mass-market game: Pong.

CityVille: 0 to 100 million users in 41 days.

All in allm $66 billion worldwide in 2011.

Online sales to surpass retail in 2013 (biggest market: __China__).

Virtual goods: $7.3 billion globally ($2 billion US).

44% of US/UK have played a mobile game in the last month.

#### Big

- Xbox Live: 35M users, 120B monthly minutes
- Zynga: 250M users, 60B monthly minutes
- WOW : 10M users, 50B monthly minutes
- Angry Birds: 100M users, 12B monthly minutes

##### We're all gamers

97% of kids play 12-17 play videogames.

Average gamer is 30 years old (37% are older than 30).

47% of all game players are women.

#### Not Just Blowing Stuff Up

- Sandbox: Minecraft.
- Building: Civ, SimCity
- Social building: The Sims, Farmville
- MMOGs: WoW
- Puzzle: Portal 2, Angry Birds

## 2.5– But It's Just a Game!?!?

#### Real World Building Blocks

(Digital) E-business 2.0 is analytics, cloud, mobile, etc.

(Digital) Social networks and media: Games are powerfully social.

Loyalty programs: Management and marketing research.

Reality -> Games: America's Army. A game made by the US Army.

Games -> Reality: Gold farming and virtual loot "Play money" by Julian Debbell

#### But... Games Were Already Real
Real World -> Game Concept

- Monthly sales competition -> Challange
- Frequent flier programs -> Levels
- Weight Watchers group -> Team
- Free coffee after ten purchases at Starbucks -> Reward
- American Express platinum card -> Badge
 
## 3.1 – Why Gamify?

Why gamify?

Dodgeball - developed in NYU and is an app for hanging around in bars
- Problem: Blank map means you dont want to do it, you need a critical mass. This works only if there are people already.
- Became Foursquare

Dodgeball cons
- Engagement Gap: need people to engage in it
- Few choices, only for bars: Basically it was check in only. If there arent that many things to do then people dont think its fun.
- No progression: You dont get anywhere by virtue of what you did. Checking in the 100th time was like checking in the first time.

Dodgeball pros
- Very social! We can collaborate, compete with, have status relative to others.
- There was an opportunity to make it a habit.

Foursquare pros
- Mayorship/badges: Made things fun and is a reward (not monetarily) but more of status

Badges have different levels of badges

## 3.2 – Think Like A Game Designer

Jesse Schell - say "I am a game designer" - state of mind - kids make up games on the playground by themselves.

Saying "I am a game designer" doesnt mean that you are a game designer yourself - being a GD is hard/technical.

Thinking like a game designer means different from thinking like a gamer:

- Gamers typically don't think of how the game works.
- Games create a state of flow and they suspend your current reality.

Think of people that are involved in your game as players and not as a customer/consumer, because players are the center of the game.

Even if a designer created the game, the players think that it is about them.

- Players feel a sense of control and meaning (not financial but something they think)
- Players play!

#### The goal is to get your players playing, and once they're in, how do I keep them playing?

## 3.3 – Design rules	

The player journey: onboarding, scaffolding, pathways to mastery.

- __Onboarding:__ Get the player as quickly into the game as possible
- __Scaffolding:__ Support structure.
- __Pathways to mastery:__ Player has achieved some real accompishment, this is very important!

#### Case Study for Onboarding: Plant vs Zombies

- Guides: "Here's what to do." Either by highlighting or something else.
- Feedback - Good job!
- Limited options - Easy at first (just one lane) but you get to figure things out
- Limited monsters
- Impossible to fail

#### Game must be balanced

- Any player can win
- Monopoly: If money was not given to the players when they pass through Go, there would be no economy

#### Create an experience

- Turntable.fm: it's like you're in a club with a bunch of people who are playing music
- The avatars, the ratings, the "now playing" all contribute to the experience of playing it
 
## 3.4 – Tapping The Emotions

What makes engaging?

Games are fun

"In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun and snap! The job's a game." - Mary Poppins

What things are fun?

- Winning
- Problem-solving
- Exploring
- Chilling
- Teamwork: We are hardwired as a species to be social
- Recognition: From others
- Triumphing - vanquishing the opponent, the notion that you crushed someone else
- Collecting
- Surprise
- Imagination
- Sharing: Altruism = hard-wired
- Role-playing
- Customization (clothes)
- Goofing off

## 3.5 – Anatomy of Fun

#### Nicole Lazzaro's 4 keys

- __Easy fun:__ Not stressing stuff. It's fun because it's easy.
- __Hard fun:__ Challenges, mastery, completion of obstacles. Fun represents accomplishment and overcoming something.
- __People fun:__ Interacting with others and working in a team.	
- __Serious fun:__ Real mission objectives and are meaningful. There's fun in doing things that are meaningful for you. Badges, etc are meaningful for you (although not for others).

These are not exclusive to themselves.

#### Leblanc's 8 kinds of fun

Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression, Submission (Casual stuff)

Book: A theory of fun for game design

#### Takeaways

- Fun can and should be designed. Things can be fun just because, but in order for us to affect behavior, we have to make things make things fun.
- Fun can be challenging.
- Appeal to different kinds of fun!
 
## 3.6 – Finding the fun

Volkswagen - the fun theory

Stairs became a piano

Deepest trash can

Lottery using speeding tickets
LinkedIn Profile Completeness bar: 

Filling in your profile gives you more data for searching and analysis

Feedback : You see how far along you are. Very common in games.

Progression: Psychologically, a dynamic is created. "I just have to finish this little thing!"

Completion - We like finishing something up, psychologically we are wired to do this

We don't have to make things super super gamelike, we just have to add this dimension of fun to it.

 
## 4.1 – Breaking Games Down

Elements of Tic Tac Toe
- Game board
- Tokens
- Two players
- Competitive: The element that we have to win etc contributes to the gameplay.
- Turns
- Win and draw states
- No progression or scoring: Limitation! It doesn't change as you play. No Level 1 TTT, Level 2 TTT...

Game = set of rules

Experience = what the player feels when playing the game

Elements = bits and pieces of the game
Games = Elements + Experiences
 
## 4.2 – The Pyramid of Gamification Elements
 
Dynamics: 

High level, conceptual elements

Constraints: What is constrained/what is not?

Emotions: What do we want our players to feel? In gamification, its real life and these push people to change their behavior.

Narrative: (binds the game i.e. storyline) Consistent experiences, puts ideas into the players heads.

Progressions: 

Relationships: Interactions with other people.
Mechanics 

Verbs: challenges (objective), chances (some luck or no luck?), competition+cooperation, feedback, etc.
Components

Nouns: Implementation of the game itself.

Achievements, quests

Avatars: Visual representation of character

Badges: Visual representation of achievement

Boss Fights: End of a part of the game, a hard challenge

Collections: Putting things together

Combat

Content Unlocking: Do this to get access to something else

Gifting: Altruism, helping newbies

Leaderboards, levels, points

Social graph: Seeing your friends also in the game

Teams

Virtual goods: "The powerful sword", users are willing to pay for these
Sum of these are aesthetics of the game

Hunicke, LeBlanc, Zubek -> MDA: Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research
4.3 – The PBL Triad

Points Badges Leaderboards are very popular game components!
The Power of Points

Keeping score

Determine win states

Connect to rewards ("I need 5k points to get a free something")

Provide (consistent) feedback

Display progress

Data for the game designer

Fungible (can replace each other)
Badges

Representations of achievement, better if seen by more people

Flexibility: You can represent ANYTHING in a badge. (Think of random badges)

Style

Signaling of importance ("This is something that is important!")

Credentials

Many badges = collections, if you think about it university diplomas are badges
Leaderboards

Ranking! Feedback on competition.

Sometimes though, people think "I won't reach this super good player"

Innovation: Personalized leaderboard: You see it versus your friends, and not versus the best in the world.

Leaderboards have also been shown that it can demotivate.
 
## 4.4 – Limitations of the Elements

We can't just throw game elements at things and expect it to be better!
The elements are not the game

Elements become successful if they tie the game together.

Not all rewards are fun and not all fun is rewarding.

It's not fun to see everyone doing the gamification thing.
Case Study: Google News Badges

These failed big time.

"If I'm going to read news, I'm going to do it just because"

It doesn't add anything except for being a badge
Take these into consideration

We want to have meaningful choices and not be forced

Challenges are not necessarily puzzles. Clicking one thousand times is challenging but is not a puzzle.

Mastery: we want to get better at something and master it.

Community: very very powerful, we want to connect people, not just put people "together".
 
4.5 – Bing Gordon Interview

People born after 1971 tend to see life as a game and see interfaces etc of the rules. 

If we want to cater to this market we have to understand gamification.

A lot of gamification stuff is based on motivation etc.

One of the main principles in Gamification is Instant Feedback. We want this normally but we don't get it. Games are very powerful here.

To get good, read blogs on thinking and of interaction designers, and play a great game because the things working in the best games are the best principles.

Buffs in WoW is so good in learning cooperation between people. Pay It Forward is inherent in human cultures and WoW is a good example.

Game makers should engineer things to make things happier when you're together.
Mistakes that people make

They think that the primary objective of games is winning competition. Cooperation trumps competition three-to-one.

They put a premium on high scoring. For the most part this is demotivating. You tend to tune out things when you're not at the high score.
Is Gamification a fad?

The principles of games, using numbers and mechanics to improve motivation have been going for a long time.

We've been giving people rewards for a long time (i.e. grades). Facebook/Twitter: how many followers can I get?

Play is the great accelerator of human culture.

Unlikely to get old. Games are polarizing, but there are some people who react poorly to extrinsic results. 

People used to hate statistics and tracking. People used to hate numbers.

Gamification is going to put pressure on a lot of things, especially schooling, gamification was invented by people who were bored in lectures.
If everyone is doing this, what's the thing to set them apart?

It's not exactly win-lose situation for businesses.

Children are growing up to become "the best version of themselves". If we can communicate more effectively, learn more effectively, then why not? If we get clearer feedback, then why not right?
 
5.1 – Gamification as Motivational Design

Motivation: you are moved to do something vs do something else.

People may not know why they do something anyway. They may also be counter-intuitive, example: people do things for rewards.

Some people like their jobs even if they have low pay.

We like sports because they are fun.

2011: MLB baseball badges give you a player badge if that player did something good in a game.

People reactions: "I was obsessed!", "I want to get the badges even though I wasn't watching the games", "I felt like a moth to a flame", "Collecting virtual items with no observable purpose and no ultimate reward or benefit does seem like an appropriate pastime for a blog such as ours."
Motivation is complicated

There are different forms of motivation and we need to be aware about them.

You want to make people buy computers. What can motivate people?

Good pcs, low prices, okay!

Make things efficient? Apple said that it wasn't that but they wanted people to come in and browse. They want to make people linger and the end of the day they'll buy your stuff. Although this is not gamification, this says that there are different ways of motivating people.
5.2 – Behaviorism

Behaviorism: we look externally at what people do, cognitivism: what's going on in people's heads?

For science it's harder to see what you feel, you just hear what they say that they feel. The scientific method can test what goes in and what comes out only.

Behavior is influenced by some stimulus (something that happens). The stimulus gets associated with a behavior. The initial form was "classical conditioning" (Pavlov). 

"Operant conditioning" introduces the notion of consequences. The consequences change your behavior. Example: mouse learns why food comes out of the thingie.

Behaviorism leads most to the branch of econ: behavioral economics ("people make mistakes consistently such as loss aversion, power of defaults, confirmation bias").
Learnings from Behaviorism

Observation: observe what people do.

Feedback loops: when the person involved sees feedback on their behavior, it tends to produce a response, action-feedback-response really works.

Reinforcement: learning occurs with the reinforcement of stimuli.
 
5.3 – Behaviorism in Gamification

Watch what people do: Behaviorism doesn't watch what people think but they look for what they actually do. 

Importance of feedback: This is essential to video games and now gamification. LinkedIn bar: not only does it tell you where you are, but it also tells you what you can do to the next level.

Conditioning through consequences: This works by making people associate the consequences with the game. Farmville: appointment mechanic.

Reinforcement through rewards: People like the feeling they get when they get the badges and they connect the video-watching to the feeling. Rewards, while valuable, are only a sort of game mechanic XD.
The Dopamine System

The structure associated with pleasure and learning: DOPAMINE. We get this neurotransmitter when we do certain activities. This is like getting a drug shot. Ex: Samsung Nation badge for "hanging out on their site".
5.4 – Reward Structures

FourSquare has different behaviors that can be rewarded: checking in multiple times, checking in everyday, checking in at bars, checking in with other people.
Cognitive evaluation theory

Tangible/intangible rewards: online badges/verbal praise are intangible rewards, while money/boy scout badge is a tangible reward.

Expected/unexpected: sometimes it just happens and our brain loves surprises. Dopamine loves surprises, unexpected rewards are cool.

Contingency (what does the player need to do to get the reward):

Task non-contingent: You just get the reward for not doing anything. Not common because doesn't have much of a point.

Engagement-contingent: We give people a reward when they start painting the house.

Completion-contingent: You have to finish it.

Performance-contingent: You have to do well.
Examples

Samsung hangout: Intangible, unexpected, engagement-contingent (from the user's perspective you have to engage the site).

Samsung hanging out a lot: Intangible, expected (you know already), completion-contingent (you know that you have to complete something).
5.5 – Reward Schedules

Refers to when the reward is offered and not what it is.

Big big psychological implication.
Types

Continuous: Reward each time. Least interesting, it doesn't feel like a reward and at some point you won't feel anything.

Fixed ratio: Every N number of times, you get a reward. Some psychological value but brain picks up on the value.

Fixed interval: Every N amount of time, you get a reward. Same psychological value as fixed ratio.

Variable: No fixed schedule. Our brains love this! This is interesting.
Variability

Competitive/non-competitive: If the reward is based on you winning in a contest, then it's based on a competition.

Certain/uncertain: Is there some chance or randomness involved (you may not get the reward when the trigger happens).
Variable Schedule Reward Machine

Slot machine: Not only is the amount of the reward variable but the reward also comes just enough so that you don't give up. The person holds out on hope and that's what make the slot machine super addictive.

There is a danger on focusing on how people respond to stimuli we put in front of them.
 
6.1 – Limits of Behaviorism

There are details that behaviorism leaves out. Ex: people slowing down. Could people be slowing down because of the feedback, or is it because they think that the sign has a camera or a cop in it? The person is not motivated because of the feedback but because of the fear of punishment.

We can't just put lotteries everywhere! We have to know why people love lotteries, we don't talk about what people do, but we talk about what people think.

Skinner's work fell out in the field of psychology because the notion of modifying people's behavior through feedback mechanisms scared people. If we take a purely behaviorist approach, we focus on this person as a player and not as a human being.
6.2 – Dangers of Behaviorism

Potential for abuse/manipulation: These are systems that make people do things. Are these things what people want to do, or what they don't want to do? The slot machine is an addiction machine and affect people's lives.

Hedonic treadmill: Once you start focusing on giving people rewards for the feedback loop, you better keep doing it because if people respond to the reward, then they'll only focus on the reward if they're there! You need to put more significant rewards etc. 

Monkeys with unexpected grape juice had this chemical high. Once researchers put a tone 2 seconds before the grape juice, the dopamine came not with the grape juice, but when the tone played. 

The dopamine system is not about the pleasure of rewards but it gives pleasure to the anticipation of rewards. If we don't have this marker for the rewards (and people look for this marker or pattern), then the game becomes less interesting, even if there are still rewards.

Overemphasis on status: When we focus too much on behavior, we focus too much on rewards. Most rewards are focused on status. We do things because we want others to think that we are cool. People begin to chase that status but not everyone wants to get a status at some point. Not everyone is always looking for that cool thingie.
6.3 – Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation

Intrinsic: I want the thing, not the rewards associated with it.

Extrinsic: I want to do this because of the reward.
SAPS (Rewards)

Status: We do it because it will make us cool.

Access: By doing the thing, you get some access that people don't have. Content unlocking, etc.

Power: I can do things because of these activities. I can edit other posts mwahaha.

Stuff.

More advantageous for companies to focus on the top to the bottom cost-wise. These are also ranked on how powerful these motivators are. Status is the most powerful.
Where do these fit?

4S badges: may be intrinsic or intrinsic. People may like these badges just because. 
6.4 – How Rewards can Demotivate

Rewards acting as extrinsic motivators can crowd out your intrinsic motivators. You become less motivated than when you started. This has been confirmed over a variety of studies.

Once rewards were taken out, the children who were intrinsically motivated didn't like drawing as much :(

People don't want to donate blood as much when there was a monetary reward. 

Caveat

Studies on extrinsic rewards-intrinsic motivation are often focused on interesting tasks.

Reward types do matter. Tangible rewards have a large demotivating effect because they substitute something external to the activity. Unexpected rewards don't have much of an effect on the intrinsic motivation. Performance-contingent rewards can go both ways: If the performance is for recognition, then it is positive. If the reward is simply saying that the goal is the end point and that it's not about the performance, then it would become negative.
6.5 – Self-Determination Theory

People are not always necessarily motivated by rewards.
The Motivational Spectrum

No motivation: Amotivation (absolutely no motivation)

Middle: Extrinsic

Most external: External regulation. The only thing that makes you do it is because of the external cause.

Introjection: We take external motivators and make them our own. Ex: status. Status says I may not really want to do this, but I will do it because people may think that I am cool.

Identification: I see the value in what I am doing. I don't really like math but I know that it is important.

Closest to intrinsic: Integration. I really want to exercise and yet I don't like exercise itself and I need that push.

Motivation: Intrinsic (you do things for doing it)

Takeaway for gamification

How can we push our approach to make the person do it for themselves? (This must be authentic, too.)
 

Competence: The sense of accomplishing something.

Autonomy: I am in control and I am the one making this choice. It's me!

Relatedness: Your activity is related to something beyond yourself. For the company, for the friends, for the world...
Fitocracy

Competence

Autonomy: Different workout foci, different workouts itself

Relatedness: Do it with friends! It's bigger than you.
 
7.1—The Design Process

Design is not just art or illustration or creative expression.

Design is a process of attacking problems.

It is a general approach of addressing challenges.
Design Thinking

Purposive—has a goal. The design of the gamified system has to constantly go back to the goal.

Human-centered—designed around people and the experience. Think of people as player instead of customer or even worse, a consumer. The experience is greater than the game and the game elements. The experience of the player is not the same as the experience of the designer.

Balance of analytical and creative—we sometimes have to create inferences from the best available explanation (abductive reasoning). We can't rely on pure analytics only because we'd get a dry solution.

Iterative—it expects that we aren't going to get it right the first time. You need to do prototyping and playtesting, sometimes starting from a paper prototype at first.
Gamification Design Framework
Define business objectives.
Delineate target behaviors.
Describe your players.
Devise activity loops.
Don't forget the fun!
Deploy the appropriate tools.
 
7.2—Objectives and Behaviors
Defining Objectives

It's the goals you want your gamified systems to accomplish.

What is this for? (Not the gamified system, but the ultimate goals of the company itself.)

What are the goals of FourSquare?

Social sharing—getting people to make a habit of checking in. If FS can get enough people to put enough geographically contextual data in the database, the database/API can be used. Seeing others check in makes you more likely to check in too.

Influencer marketing—being a mayor can give you discounts and coupons. Because a mayor always checks in, he is what marketers call an "influencer", or someone that can promote the company to other people. FS can take advantage of this using advertising and marketing partnerships. Ex: 30% discount while you hold the title of being a mayor.
Defining Objectives—Steps

List and rank possible objectives. Figure out the tradeoffs of what you want to happen.

Eliminate means to and ends such as badges. The badges aren't your objective, by themselves they don't have any meaning. The goal is not to manipulate the user to do what the company wants.

Justify objectives. Why is that objective something you want to achieve? You'll be able to generate the dependencies if you do this.
Delineating Target Behaviors

Specific—if we have too large a scope, then it would be harder to tackle the problem.

Success metrics—what are the "win states" in this gamified system? What lets players know they have achieved something? What are the decision points where you can rank stuff in.

Analytics—how can we measure the win states? 

DAU/MAU or the ratio of daily average users to monthly average users. We want to see if people constantly go to the site, or if they just go once and go back. A higher ratio means people go back more frequently.

Virality—how much people refer their friends to the site. If a person tells other people then an application is successful. Think of Pinterest and Zynga games.

Volume of activity—how many points get given out monthly? Think of the economy of points. Are people at the bottom of the levelling curve, or are they at the top?
7.3—Describe Your Players

What do you know about the players? The demographics, age groups, where they live, income level, and psychographic—what do you know about their behavior?

Different communities have different needs. Your customers might be different from your employees so adjust your gamification framework according to who they are.

In a WOW chat log you'll see that people want different things: a healer, an enchanter, selling some stuff, buying some stuff.
Bartle MMOG Player Type Model

Bartle studied the old MMOG games and he was able to find trends with the different players. While he didn't want to categorize and compartmentalize everything, his model is still useful.
 

Achievers want to have the achievements and win the game.

Explorers want to see what the world is like.

Socializers like interacting with the other players.

Killers want to impose their will on other people, either by killing or by being intense.

People are a mixture of the different quadrants and we go back and forth between the different activities.
 
7.4—Activity Loops
Engagement loops (micro level)
 

The key is the clear, immediate, and direct feedback.

Creating a gamified system is structured on how we construct this engagement loop.
Progression loops (macro level)

Splitting the game into smaller loops or intermediate steps which are balanced. Major quest, minor quest, stages, etc.

There is also a progression from newbie to pro.
 
 
7.5—Fun and Tools
Don't Forget the Fun

It turns out that when people go along the path of gamifying something, they forget to answer why players would like to do stuff.

Is exploring Samsung.com supposed to be fun for most people? Compare it to Fitocracy where working out is supposed to be fun.

Is the LinkedIn progress bar fun by itself? There is probably some small fun in knowing that you have filled your LinkedIn bar already.

FoldIt was a game developed by researchers from the University of Washington to help solve the protein solving problem. Because protein folding looks like a puzzle, people get to solve a bigger problem voluntarily.
Tools

While PBL gamification works, there are a lot of different solutions.
 
8.1—Taking Stock: Two Approaches to Gamification
Is this a game?

Slot machine—is there a playful attitude, meaningful choice, etc. The slot machine is just a random machine generator, it's not based on the skill of your play. It's just like flipping a coin a ton of times.

Gamified systems have feedback loops, surprises, and they are engaging in the way that games are engaging.

Basically, while slot machines are "games of chance", they aren't really that much of a game.
2 Approaches
 

If you're focused on getting people to do things, then you'd focus more on the marketing and economics side.

If you're focused on getting people to feel things, then you'd focus more on game design and cognitive psychology.

Do we put out incentives for behavior, or do we design experiences for out players?

Do we want to satisfy our players' needs, or do we want to make the experience fun for other people?

Most importantly, "doing" wants people to make do things that they don't want, whereas "feeling" wants people to achieve their potential.

While kwerb favors "feeling", "doing" has shown that it can influence behavior.
8.2—Is Gamification Right for Me?

Motivation—where would you derive value from encouraging behavior?

Meaningful choices—are your target activities sufficiently interesting?

Structure—can the desired behaviors be modeled through algorithms? Can we make a computer program out of this? If its too vague or subjective then gamification would probably not work.

Potential conflicts—can the game avoid tension with other motivational structures?
Motivation

The thing you want to do has to have some emotional connections, unique skills, creativity, or teamwork.

Or, we want to make boring tasks interesting.

Read Reamde by Neal Stephenson.
Meaningful Choices

Are there options for the user and does the gamified system do things in a way where the user can make choices with a meaningful outcome?

Remember the Google News example. If you read about Syria and get a badge for it, do you want to really get a Syria badge? Reading news is usually about reading a lot of different things rather than focusing on one topic only.
Structure

Can we use rules and algorithms to encode the behaviors? How would you know if someone tweeted about your product?
Conflicts

There is already a motivation scheme for companies (salary). Adding gamification stuff should not clash with the existing motivation schemes.

8.3—Designing for Collective Good
(http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html)
StackOverflow. How did it become popular?

They were able to think of the problem in the right way: you can look as programming as rote, or you can look at programming as fun.
"The field of programming is almost by definition one of constant learning. Programming is supposed to be fun..."
–Jeff Atwood

This makes SO not seem like a carrot-and-stick proposition. Much like Mary Poppins, if you can find the fun in something, then programming turns into something that isn't a game.

The norms of programmers differ from the norms of other communities. Compare FourSquare badges, which are colorful, to StackOverflow's "badges", which are numeric.
 

Moderators and good answerers can change and improve the existing answers, which improve the answer quality.

More activity improves the system.
Stack Overflow is in many ways my personal Counter-Strike.
–Jeff Atwood

CS was always structured to be played as a team. Going off on your own means you will almost certainly die, and that is much like SO. While it's easier to go off by yourself, CS makes you work with the team because you won't win by yourself.

The design of Stack Overflow makes helping your fellow programmers the most effective way to "win".
SO Structure

Upvotes on your questions and answers give you reputation. Reputation comes from other people saying you did a good job

Bounties with reputation can be placed on questions and gifted. These reward the greater good and they encourage groups to do "what's best for the world rather than their own specific, selfish needs".

Atwood says that the game elements in StackOverflow lead people in behaving in the right direction.

With additional reputation you get to police more stuff.

Badges in FS aren't for showing off, but for doing helpful things for the community. Ex: asking great questions, coming up with a great answer, editing a lot of posts.
All the gaming elements are there in service of a higher purpose... I believe it ultimately helps me become a more knowledgeable and a better communication whil also improvingthe very fabric of the web for everyone.
–Jeff Atwood

Check out positive psychology and flow by Seligman/Czikszentmihalyi.

PERMA

Positive emotions

Engagement

Relationships

Meaning

Achievement
Conditions for Flow

Clear goals

Balance between perceived challenges and perceived skills (the game feels like it is just right)

Clear and immediate feedback
 
8.5—Amy Jo Kim Interview

Proliferation of gamification comes with people who played games as a child growing up now, and with an increased number of APIs available.

Now while the word gamification may go away, the principle itself will just get bigger and bigger.

While Bartle's model works in some cases, much like every system, it wouldn't be able to represent all cases. Models are basically just models.
Kim's Social Engagement Verbs
 

Bartle missed self-expression. People are motivated to express themselves.
 

Not all games are zero-sum. Most sports/rank ordered competitions are zero-sum but the recent games are not zero-sum. The Sims, Draw Something, playground stuff, party games, charity walks, these are all non-zero-sum games and is the heart of collaborative games.

Misconceptions with web devs: a gaming experience changes over time and there are key stages of the player life cycle and they require different sets of features for different players.

Throwing points at people is not sustainable because people level up over time. Think of newbie-regular-expert as an analytic tool.
9.1—Enterprise Applications
Potential takeups

Intranet/Extranet Engagements—Game elements can be used to increase engagement and show who's the expert via leaderboards.

Productivity Enhancement—Helping and encouraging their employees with constant feedback. This can improve their judge performance. We can put CSAT, KPIs, a list of achievements, etc.

Efficiency Enhancement—Productivity is for core job responsibility, efficiency is about making them do work better by doing work efficiently.

People waste a ton of time on their email. The email game: we get to see how much time you spend checking your email.

Knowledge Management—Deloitte WhoWhatWhere game lets people know things about each other.

HR—Hiring, onboarding, acculturation, corporate training, performance review, employee recognition, and T&E (travel and entertainment can be used as a reimbursement).

Innovation—Virtual stock market, employees "buy and sell shares of ideas" and people are encouraged to generate ideas.

Serious Games—A game that is about manipulating a manufacturing plant.
 
9.2—Workplace Motivations
What Motivates People at Work?

Rewards—Pay, bonuses, stock options, praise, promotions, responsibilities... all of these are extrinsic motivators. They are compensation: you are compensated for something that you don't want to do (work).

Gamification can do something better and it can activate intrinsic motivation.

Skill Development—Learning is about problem solving and engaging the parts of your brain that want to figure out things. Ex: LiveOps has people working for them and they answer calls, people who want to develop customer skills can use the service and learn stuff. "We want you to learn different aspects of the job and how to be effective."

Information—Employees often don't know what they're doing. They want to take advantage of their good performances. Ex: Restaurant employees have different metrics, ranking, earned and potential tips, these can provide information to the employees and to the company for better shift management.

Corporate Citizenship—Ex: Microsoft translation game, people believed that they were helping Microsoft and they want to take pride in their workplace.

Fun—Ex: Zappos face game, you get a picture of your coworker and you are able to get to know your co-workers.
 
9.3—The Game vs the Job

Employees might get focused on the game as opposed to the job. There might be a time where the game is pushing in one direction while the job pushes them in the other.

Compare: Lower AHT or higher CSAT? If the company wants a higher CSAT then the company shouldn't gamify the AHT because agents would grind AHT.

Citizenship Behaviors—People will do things at work just to be nice to colleagues or for the company. Altruism, conscientiousness, civic virtue, courtesy, and sportsmanship. We can tap into the different desires.
Would gamification be good?	Core (everyone has these skills)	Unique (Many people don't have this)	Future (skills an employee want to gain)
In-role (what you were hired to d- Boring for the people, not very motivating.		Good! Since you want to improve yourself, gamification helps.
Citizenship (for being a good person in the org)	Good! You don't need skills to do this.		

 
9.4—Playbor

Is the game truly voluntary?

By definition, if the game is forced, then it isn't a game.

Ex: Monitoring checkout speeds, it is Big Brotherish and there is no motivation for the employee, it's employee "we will reward you for doing well or we will punish you for being mediocre", not really game-like.

Ex: Leaderboard+ranking for Disneyland hotel employees, they call it an electronic whip. Employees don't perceive the gamification not as pro-autonomy and information but as controlling and as "we are telling you what to do". It does not promote intrinsic motivation.

Although this is good for competition, people get pressured when they want to step up, and people have to conform to the standards. Workers become demoralized and will have a weaker performance than before.

The workers' perception of  the system plays a big role. The pure leaderboard/ranking system doesn't promote camaraderie, it promotes Lord of the Flies-style competition.
 
9.5—Daniel Debow Interview

Daniel = VP, Salesforce Rypple.

Rypple gives coaching, an easy way to gather feedback, etc. to employees.

Why gamification? They weren't thinking of games/gamification but they were just thinking of the design and seeing what's effective and what motivates people. The 

Game designers knew that we can't just slap game mechanics on everything.

Look at the data and look at the behaviors. People wanted giving feedback to others. How can we make this a non-flame war? People don't care about the badges but they care about the meaning attached to it. "What I did mattered and it was important".

Experiment, try things out. Don't spend your time hypothesizing and you won't know until you try.

What's different fundamentally when applying to the enterprise vs customer engagement?

Lots of things similar but there is a different social construct.

Ex: reward was I will give you x dollars to you and your referral, does this work? People actually hated this and they didn't want to do the referral for money. People are spending social capital and they might be seen differently.

Behaviors are heavily dictated by the organization. People moderate their behavior at work because they are watched by everyone. They don't want to deviate from the corporate culture.

Can gamification work for traditional companies?

FB/LinkedIn are not like what they look like in The Social Network, they are a real big company.

Traditional companies are also clients.

Traditional companies are super desperate for solutions that they want the gamification too.

It's not like people don't play games already at work. Job titles, job roles, etc. "What level am I am?" Symbols of power: corner office, parking slot, people assign blame to different people. How do you harness the psych/sociology games people play with each other at work?

How to avoid the competitiveness/cutthroatness brought by games?

Be empirical, try things, see what happens. Everyone has their own theories but most of the time they are wrong. Ex: Paypal proved that people are actually good and don't scam shit.

Ask people who have designed games to solve the problem. They have experience and are grounded in the literature.
 
10.1—Gamification for Good?

G can motivate people to have finance skills, or eating healthy, or having a lower carbon footprint.

Two good things can come out of this: society is better and people are better.
What's different?

Inherent relatedness—In serious games, there is something involved that is bigger than the individual.

Not really a compelling argument because we know that there are things we know are important but we don't do them.

We want people to act on the latent desire to do that.

Rewards for doing good?—G may put a premium on doing it for the award/achievements because you crowd out stuff which were good already.

Behavior change—We want people to get over the hump and get them to do something that they want to do already.  
 
10.2—Social Good Applications

Health and Wellness: Zamzee.

The Zamzee is a little device that keeps track of how active you are using its accelerometer. Zamzee is targetted at low-income teenagers.

Mechanics: Activity tracking, PBLs, achievements.

30% increase in activity levels with the Zamzee.

Other ex: Fitocracy, Superbetter (quests, allies, power-ups, bad guys).

Energy and Environment: Opower.

You are able to see trends on your power spending. You are able to see your efficiency compared to your neighbors.

The peer pressure (if you suck) is a very big motivation to help people.

2-4% less energy utilization. 

Other ex: RecycleBank

Education

We already have a gamified system (grades etc).

The goal is to make the students not focus on the rewards, they should be intrinsically motivated for learning.

How to incorporate game structures to existing curriculum? Read The Multiplayer Classroom.

Credentialling—We can confirm that you have the skills, traditionally we have degrees and certs. Mozilla OpenBadge.

Government

Gov't can act as an enterprise.

Gov't acts with citizens and provides customer service.

Gov't can use G to promote its policies and their benefits. 
 
10.3—Social Good Techniques

CAPRI (Congestion and Parking Relief Incentives)—Used to solve Rush Hour, they incentivized people to spread out their arrival and departure and their parking habits.

PBL, rewards, feedback

Monitoring: information automatically gets recorded and you are able to automatically detect shit, hard to get people to report to you. Sensors are being used to automatically track what you are doing.

Communal pressure—Seeing your position relative to other people motivate people to do better.

Kukui Cup—Competition between the different dorms on how to spend less energy than others. 

Contrast vs competition in the enterprise where competition is zero-sum. In the social good, there is no existing structure of "that is your job", so it has less potential to be dangerous and has more potential to encourage good behavior.

Practically Green—You might want to see your impact on the world. You see how much energy, fuel, trees, and water you save by using the service.

CAPRI India/Singapore—People love randomly generated stuff such as a lottery-type of system vs something with normally spaced reward.
 
10.4—Behavior Change

Is G sustainable to induce behavior change?

Habit formation—Habits don't require you to turn on that part of the brain. We want to change things from conscious to semi-conscious.
Fogg Behavior Model
 

Need a decent combination of motivation, an ability, and a trigger.

Able to do things more easily if you are motivated and the difficult of the task. There is a trade-off between motivation and ability.

Trigger timing. The trigger should be designed at the right moment when the people is at the right time to do stuff. Too many triggers become noise.

Trigger types

Sparks. They increase your motivation.

Facilitator. They make things seem to be easier.

Signal. Reminder to "do things now"
Relation to Gamification Model

Engagement loops create the hole to do something because of the feedback involved. Increases motivation.

Progression loops—Players feel that they are getting better (and they are also getting better).

Good games trigger effectively—Good games put triggers at the right time.
 
10.5—Susan Hunt Stevens Interview

Game elements are easier online and it can scale easier when inside a computer.

Because being green doesn't have that big of an impact rewards-wise (money etc) we can use game elements to give that concept of a reward.

We don't want to inspire change but we want people to get feedback in what we do. Instead of being preachy, sustainability becomes fun.

Most games have a shelf-life of about 18 months, you have to design differently when you're thinking about long-term play and engagement. How would you keep people inspired for a longer time?

80% of people are participating for the social benefits of doing something together.

Anything different about building a community game-mechanic vs other online contexts?

Different contexts when people are close vs people aren't that close, the trusted groups act differently. People in the workplace are the most engaged in the game, then friends/family, last are with others they don't know.

Games are easier to integrate into an existing community because now they have shared content and shared rules etc.

How does getting feedback affect people's behavior?

Easier for people to judge if they're good or not that good.

Making things easier to accomplish make people want to play the game more. How can you provide reinforcement/rewards (not stuff but access/power) and how do you get people inside the feedback loop, and how do they provide feedback to others?

How do you get them to not be too focused on rewards?

They don't have points/currency because the more tangible the reward, the more incentive it is to cheat the system.

"People buying more stuff" defeats the purpose of "being green". They are asking what are the intrinsic motivators vs the extrinsic ones. How do you give people social stuff?

Lower incentive to cheat when you play with people you're close to.

Can gamification be the norm for the foundations of behavioral change?

Pre-social media, we can't figure out how to scale things, how can we get people to show their social rewards. Social media has allowed us to display that shit.
 
The Magic Potion of Game Dynamics
http://lithosphere.lithium.com/t5/science-of-social-blog/The-Magic-Potion-of-Game-Dynamics/ba-p/19260
Fogg Behavior Model

The goal of game dynamics is to drive a user-desired behavior predictably.

FBM: Motivation, ability, and trigger must converge at the same moment to make your game dynamics effective.
Between Motivation and Ability

Clarification: ability doesn’t always mean skills in this context, it can be time, attention, mental capacity, or any scarce resources that the user needs.
 
11.1—Pointsification

Gamification takes the thing that is least essential to games (points) and represents it as the core of the experience.

Points and badges have no closer a relationship to games than they do to websites and fitness apps and loyalty cards.

Gamification is an inadvertent con. It tricks people into believing that there's a simple system (PBL) when there is not.

So does it actually work, or does G reduce to pointsification?

Real research on effectiveness is limited.

There is a real risk of engagement decay.

Crowding out/overjustification. "Gamification is the high fructose corn syrup of engagement.", you take the real organic values of games and distill it to this harmful thing.

FourSquare redesigned their UI to lessen the game elements.

Gamification didn't work? Did the badges become something silly?

The game elements were still there, but they were prominent when the company was starting to grow and there was no intrinsic motivation ("I check in because my friends were checking in").
Implications

Names are powerful, the word "gamification" implies that this is about games.

Bad gamification is bad, just using PBLs is behaviorist and will be limited to the psychology of rewards.

There is more to games than gamification, and there is more to gamification than games.

Caveat ludor—there is a difference between games/gamification.
 
11.2—Exploitationware

Too effective? Remember playbor.

It's not an accidental con, it's an intentional con to confuse people that their job doesn't suck when it does.

G undermines the relationship between an employer and their employee.

You can't replace real incentives with fictional ones.

Real incentives come at a cost but provide value for both parties based on a relationship of trust.

They're just getting something empty in return.

There are examples of G in the call center world that are empty and some that give the workers meaning to learn.

In fact there is a game, Cow Clicker, where the point is literally to click the cows, and it turns out that 50K people actively used this.

That's why the first step in the G framework is the "defining objectives" and an early step is "defining the players" in order for you to not abuse them.

Exploitationware is legit, take this into consideration when gamifying something.
 
11.3—Gaming the Game

You can't be sure what the players may do and they may game the system.

Ex: Tolls rise and fall depending on the off-hours. Problem is that a lot of people swerve and park on side of the road at 6:59pm to avoid the tolls. This is very dangerous!

Well-designed games with social elements have lesser incidence of cheating but if a reward or incentive is great enough may encourage cheating.

Cheating might be beneficial sometimes, ex: insider trading in an innovation market website. While cheating in the real-world, in a gamified system this allowed people to share, find, and develop ideas.
11.4—Legal Issues

Legal system can become a problem or you can be sued because of:

Privacy—You get a lot of information about your players. Every action in a game can potentially be collected by the system. These vary regardless where you are.

Employment/Labor Law issues—Target checkout-system/Disneyland whip led to labor disputes.

Deceptive Marketing—If people think that the game is for fun when they are marketing ploys then they may think that they are being deceived by the company.

Intellectual Property—All of the virtual goods in a gamified system are potentially protected by IP laws.

Virtual goods/virtual assets and their rights, what happens if a user pays money to get something virtual in the game? Do these things have something of value, ex: the value of the virtual goods decreases or the game designer removes it?

Courts say that this is a license (something you get contractually) and not ownership.

The CARD Act (US) regulates virtual gift cards, might have some influence on gamified services.
 
11.5—Regulatory Issues

This means that practice is allowed but subject to restrictions.

Paid endorsements—When someone becomes a marketer of the product, ex: bloggers who were asked by companies to endorse the products, and their readers thought they were just reviewing it.

The legal was that you have to say your intent.

This applies in G because some badges/rewards are given for "liking a post" and stuff.

Banking regulation—If there is money in the G, then stuff such as record-keeping, reserve requirements, currency manipulation, anti-fraud, money laundering, consumer protection, taxation/accounting must apply to them.

Sweepstakes and Gambling—Different states have different regulations, and gambling is regulated nationally. If a G system seems like gambling, then regulators might say that it is subject to the rules and regulations of gambling.

A gambling is a game of chance as opposed to games of skill.
12.1—Beyond the Basics

Inducement Prizes—The use of rewards to get people to do something, you are mobilizing large amounts of people but you want them to compete against each other.

Collective Action—Crowdsourcing, mechanisms to get people to work together to solve a problem, not employees or participants already but people coming in because of the interest level and the fun factor of the activity.

Virtual Economies—Economic pressure and techiques can be applied to the currencies in the virtual world.

The Future—Where can gamification go from here?
 
12.2—Inducement Prizes

In 1919 a prize was promised to the first team who was able to fly a nonstop transtlantic flight, this led to Lindbergh's first flight across the Atlantic.

Alternative to direct funding—versus internal R&D, this is more efficient because the total investment of the contestants was more expensive than the prize money.

Exxon Valdez oil spill—The water was too cold and the oil too viscous to take out, contest to solve this problem. Solved with a technique involving vibrating the water and it worked, but this was thought by a normal dude.

By not specifying the means, but only the ends, they were able to find solutions.
Prizes and Gamification

While inducement prizes are extrinsic (money), think of self determination theory factors (competence/autonomy/relatedness), the winning group demonstrates each of these SDT factors.

Competence—People want to prove how great their solutions were, even more than the money. 

Autonomy—Just solve it, I don't care how!

Relatedness—Need collaboration and communication between teams/people, and people share a common goal.

Ex: X Prize Foundation ($10M to bring a rocket to low earth orbit), Innocentive, Kaggle, TopCoder, DARPA Grand Challenges, America Competes Act, OSTP Initiative
What does this take?

Have to encourage the behavior of participants.

Enough people have to be capable of competing.

Costs sufficiently small, organizations are willing to spend their own money.

Balance scale vs. incentives—A bigger prize is going to have more competition, but people would think "what chance do I have". Need to balance both.

Opportunities to leverage results—For both the sponsor and the participants themselves.
 
12.3—Virtual Economies

Persistent virtual rewards can become virtual goods.

Tradable and redeemable points can become virtual currency, much like money in the real world.

In-game transactions and markets become a virtual economy.

Games like FarmVille: $7B in 2010, estimated $13B in 2016.

Loyalty programs can be virtual currencies, but they are not motivated by fun, they are literally just virtual currencies.

Need balance—economic dynamics are driven by scarcity and not money, you need to have faucets (put money in the economy) and drains (remove money from the economy).

Hard and desirable stuff such as Dragons etc make people take the money away from the economy.
Dangers

Real money may cost real money 

Hedonic tradmill/crowding-out effect because currency and credits are tangible extrinsic rewards

There is an intrinsic value from rarity and surprise and both of them are removed when you delve into virtual economies.
 
12.4—Collective Action

G can be good for collective action and encouraging people to collaborate with one another.

Competitive, top-down—Grants, a company or organization says they want to find a person to do this, we pick the winner and give them money to do this.

Competitive, bottom-up—Inducement prizes, still competitive but anyone can submit and the organization only pays off to the winner.

Collaborative, top-down—Employees, ask people to solve a problem.

Collaborative, bottom-up—Crowdsourcing/microwork, encourages people to come together to collaborate with each other and do a small amount of work to complete the task. Motivated voluntarily to take on a task.
How are people motivated for people who are not their employer?

Money. Microwork exchange platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk capitalize on things that a human needs to do.

FoldIt, people were able to solve protein folding problems.

Microtask—Gamifies digitizing stuff such as forms into an Excel spreadsheet.

ESP Game—Game where you compare if people get the same descriptions and keywords for a picture. Useful for image search.

They were not told that these were games, they were just asked to do stuff.

Tasks need to be easily split and humans have to be able to do it instead of computers.

Love and fun.
 
12.5—The Future of Gamification

What would happen if G really becomes pervasive in our life?

The movie Sight shows some of the dark side of G when you take it too far.

As someone who now knows G, you can choose whether the G is empowering or manipulative.

Shallow, or thoughtful

Doing, or feeling
