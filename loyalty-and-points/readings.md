# TPG beginner’s guide: Everything you need to know about points, miles, airlines and credit cards
[Reference](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/beginners/)

- By using a debit card, you're spending money and not getting anything back in return.
- Every time you use a credit card, you're earning points and miles that you can put towards your next vacation. All the money you spend is like an investment in your next trip.
- What are points and miles?
  - Currencies listed by credit cards, airlines, and hotels to keep you loyal to them: called loyalty programs. Airline miles = airline tickets, hotel points = hotel stays, credit card points = direct redemption for travel.
  - Not all points-and-miles currencies are worth the same thing.
  - ***Never pay more for a flight in points or miles than you would if you just paid for it in cash with your credit card.***
  - Cash price / total points or miles = value per point or mile.

## Earning Points and Miles

- Sign-up and welcome bonuses.
- Shopping portal: When you start at the portal instead of going directly to a retailer's website, you'll earn bonus points or miles.
- Doing business with a given loyalty program.
