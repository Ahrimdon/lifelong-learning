## Sleep Smarter: 21 Essential Strategies to Sleep Your Way to a Better Body

- Sleep deprivation: immune system failure, diabetes, cancer, obesity, depression, memory loss.
- Just one night of sleep deprivation can make you as insulin resistant as a person with type 2 diabetes. This translates to aging faster, decreased libido, and storing more body fat than you want to.
- Sleep dep (less than 6 hours per night) is related to an inability to lose weight.
- Fewer than 4 hours of sleep: twice as likely to die prematurely from heart disease.
- Genes are not what directly control our health, appearance, and personality.
- Nutrigenomics: how the food you eat affects your genetic expression.
- Sleep determines the quality of "copies" that your body prints out of you.

### Know the Value of Sleep

- Being awake is catabolic (breaks you down), being asleep is anabolic (builds you up).
- After just 24 hours of sleep deprivation, there is an overall reduction of 6% in glucose reaching the brain. *This is why you crave sweets if you are sleep deprived. Your body is trying to compel you to get that glucose back to your brain ASAP.*
- Your parietal lobe and the prefrontal cortex actually lose 12-14 percent of their glucose when you don't sleep.
- When your prefrontal cortex starts to shut down, your brain knows it can find a quick source of glucose and your willpower suffers.
- When you are tired, you are not the best version of yourself. Same with being sleep-deprived.
- Lymphatic system: eliminates metabolic waste and toxins to keep you healthy. *However, this does not include your brain.* The brain has a glymphatic system (g for glial cells).
- Your brain cells are reduced in size by about 60% when you're asleep to make waste removal even more efficient.
- Because your brain is so active while you're awake, it's continuously building up byproducts that are mainly removed by the restorative power of sleep.

### Get More Sunlight During the Day

- Humans have evolved with a predictable pattern of light and darkness that has always controlled out sleep cycles. Your sleep cycle is heavily impacted by the amount of sunlight you receive during the day.
- Circadian rhythm: regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, found in the hypothalamus (this controls your body's hunger, thirst, fatigue, body temperature, and sleep cycles).
- How does morning light improve sleep? Light actually signals your hypothalamus and all corresponding organs and glands to be alert and "wake up."
- *Sunlight exposure triggers your body to produce optimal levels of daytime hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate your biological clock.*
- Serotonin: Feelings of happiness and well-being. Many antidepressant drugs are centered around this.
- 95% of your serotonin is located in the gastrointestinal tract. It is influenced by your diet, your activity level, and it's also influenced by the amount of natural sunlight you get.
- Most of us suffer from the effects of light deprivation.
- *Office workers who didn't have access to windows got 173% less exposure to natural light, and slept an average of 46 minutes less per night..*
- Not only is serotonin rooted in your belly, it is also located in blood platelets, your central nervous system, and even your skin.
- Serotonin and serotonin transporters have been found in human skin cells and are heavily influenced by exposure to sunlight.
- Human skin can produce Serotonin can transform it into  melatonin.

#### Melatonin

- Produced by the pineal gland and other tissues in your body that send you signals to your cells to prepare you for sleep.
- It improves your sleep quality by helping to create the optimal conditions in your body for getting amazing sleep.
- Some researchers believe that melatonin is related to aging. When you sleep smarter, there won't be any dramatic drop-off, and you can sleep like a baby for more years of your life.

#### Cortisol

- Your body produces this for a reason. The goal isn't to have as little cortisol as possible, but to have a healthy rhythm of cortisol production to get you the results you want, when you want them.
- Increase in cortisol in the morning, which is for the purpose of getting up.
- Natural reduction in cortisol as the day goes on, bottoming out in the evening.
- Weird thing: you are supposed to be tired at night but sometimes you are alert, and you are supposed to be alert in the morning, but you feel sleepy.
- Daytime exposure to sunlight is so important that it encourages the production of cortisol. Exposure to sunlight decreased cortisol levels later in the day when compared to being exposed to dim light during the day. By getting more exposure to sunlight, you set the tempo for a normal cortisol rhythm, and a normal melatonin rhythm as well.

### Avoid Screens Before Bedtime

- The artificial blue light produced by computers kick out a sleep-sucking blue spectrum of light that can give you major sleep problems. You will produce more cortisol.
- The use of light-emitting electronic devices in the hours before bedtime can impact overall health, alertness, and the circadian clock that synchronizes the daily rhythm of sleep. Lower secretions of melatonin too.
- When we are addicted to technology, we are hardwired not to the technology, but it's that we are hardwired to continue to seek.
- Dopamine, apparently, is not about pleasure. The pleasure is an end result that we receive from the opioid system. It is a brain chemical about finding out what's coming next.
- The Internet is designed for the seeking brain and dopamine because there's an infinite amount of data you can discover there.
- Eliminating the dopamine transporters in mice (which enabled dopamine to stick around longer in their system) resulted in mice that sleep a lot less.
- Dopamine is tied to motivation and alertness, whereas serotonin is tied to contentment and relaxation.
- Make a mandate to turn off all screens at least 90 minutes before bedtime to allow melatonin and cortisol levels to normalize.
- Before sleeping, you can read books or chat with people.
- One of the most important things you can do is to turn off the cues. Remove automatic notifications.

### Have a Caffeine Curfew

- Caffeine 3 hours or 6 (!) hours before bed showed significant measurable disruptions in their sleep.
- Measurable 1 hour of sleep with 6 hours before, but they didn't know it at first.
- All day when you're awake, neurons in your brain are firing and producing a neurotransmitter by-product known a adenosine. Your nervous system is constantly monitoring for adenosine in your body, because one the levels of it rise to a certain point, your body starts to nudge you to sleep (or at least to relax).
- Caffeine fits into adenosine receptors. *It doesn't actually turn on functions to make you tired. So your brain and body are still trucking along but your brain doesn't realize that you are actually sleepy.*
- So your brain keeps on producing adenosine, but the adenosine never gets properly metabolized. So your body literally has to change the way it normally functions, stress hormones increase, and your brain and organs get overworked because they aren't getting the accurate cues to recover.
- Problem is, with a spike in stress hormone production comes the crash. When you come back to your stress levels before the adrenaline spike, you go below it.
- Caffeine causes vasoconstriction (tightening or narrowing of your blood vessels). When you stop taking it, your body will undergo vasodilation (an instant widening of the blood vessels). Suddenly, where blood flow was once restricted, blood comes rushing in and pushing more freely. This is felt most in the head and neck region and can manifest as a headache on only one side of the head.
- Fixing addiction
  - We changed from coffee to tea.
  - Exercise--some peaceful walks, some yoga, and anything else that wasn't too stressful.
  - Increased water intake a bit and add in a high quality sea salt.
  - Increase in fiber.
  - Accountability of someone cheering her on.
  - The challenge is if people are having more servings of caffeine in a day.

### Be Cool

- Your body temp cycles from 1 degree to 1 degree above the normal temperature.
- Optimum room temperature for sleep: 15-20 C.
- Insomniacs tend to have a significantly warmer body temperature than normal right before bed. When they wore "cooling caps", they slept even faster than people without sleep disorders. They took 13 minutes to fall asleep, compared to 16 minutes for the health control group.
- HPA axis: critical in normal hormone function, sexual function, and managing body weight. Takeaway: This hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is the body's number one system for managing stress.
- Insomniacs experienced greater levels of anticipatory anxiety than normal. Higher levels of worry and stress over sleeping. You need to be cool, too. From work, relationships, nutrition, and exercise, your HPA axis manages it all.

### Get to the Bed at the Right Time

- Most beneficial hormonal secretions/recovery: 10:00pm to 2:00am.
- We are literally designed to sleep a few hours after dark.
- Melatonin, HGH, and more are secreted in their strongest doses when your sleep is lined up properly. The best dose of HGH (youth hormone) is if you're sleeping during those primetime hours.
- This is why some people get 8 hours of sleep bu don't feel well rested when they wake up.


### Power Tips

- When you have a big task coming up, pull out a calendar and plan ahead how you can get your ideal number of sleep hours in. If it's important to you, you'll schedule it. Stick to that schedule as well as you can, and know that you will get the work done better and faster if you're more rested.
- Reframe your idea of sleep, instead of it being "something you have to do", see it as a special treat for yourself and love the entire process. *I've got a hot date with sleep tonight, and we are really going to get it on!* Treat yourself to some incredible sleep, you deserve it.
- The body clock is most responsive to sunlight in the early morning, between 6 am and 8:30 am.
- Getting direct sunlight outdoors for at least half an hour has been shown to produce the most benefit. Even rainy weather is better than indoor lighting.
- Use your break time to get sun on your skin. Even on an overcast day, the sun's rays will make their way through and positively influence your hormone function. Take your 10-15 minute breaks outdoors or near a window, or eat your lunch outside.
- Only getting sunlight through a window is not that good, you need UVB which might not permeate the windows.
- Sunglasses inhibit the natural exposure of light you need to assure healthy hormonal secretions and healthy sleep.
- Seasonal affective disorder--a form of depression that tends to occur during the darker winter months. You can have devices like mirrors, visors, etc. to help treat yourself.
- Set an unbreakable caffeine curfew. For most people, that's 2:00 pm.
- You can do caffeine in the morning for a cortisol boost.
- Warm bath 1 1/2 hours to 2 before sleeping. Core temp will rise and then fall around the time you turn in for the night.
- Mattress pads can be used that help regulate your body temperature.
- Cooling of the room is a must, but some people will feel great all night with a fluffy comforter, some with a few bed sheets, and some would feel better using an additional cooling pad.
- Socks. If your hands or feet are too cold, it could be a sign of poor circulation.
