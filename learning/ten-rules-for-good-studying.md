## Ten Rules for Good Studying

- Use recall. Recall main ideas when you are walking to a class or in a different room from where you originally learned it.
- Test yourself. On everything. All the time.
- Chunk your problems. Make sure you can solve problems cold, every step.
- Space your repetition. The brain is like a muscle, it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.
- Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice. Quiz yourself randomly on different types of problems. You can write a problem on one side of a flash card and the solution on the other. Quiz yourself randomly on different types of problems.
- Take breaks. A little studying every day is much better than a lot of studying all at once.
- Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies. "How can I explain this so that a ten-year old could understand it?
- Focus/Pomodoro technique.
- Do the hardest things earliest in the day.
- Mental contrast--post picture/words in your workspace to remind you of your dream. Look at your dreams if your motivation is lagging.

## Ten Rules of Bad Studying

- Passive rereading.
- Letting highlights overwhelm you. *Highlighting text can fool your mind into thinking you are putting something in your brain, when all you're really doing is moving your hand.*
- Don't just glance at a solution and think that you know how to do it.
- Cramming. You don't cram when you were practicing for a track meet.
- Repeatedly solving problems of the same type that you already know how to solve. It's like preparing for a basketball game by just practicing your dribbling.
- Group study works when checking problem solving, quizzing one another on what you know.
- Not reading the textbook before you start working on problems.
- Not clearing up points of confusion.
- Thinking you can learn deeply when you are being constantly distracted.
- Not getting enough sleep. Your brain pieces together problem-solving techniques when you sleep. Prolonged fatigue allows toxins to build up in the brain that disrupt the neural connections you need to think quickly and well.
