## Focused vs. Diffuse Thinking

- Modes of thinking: focused and diffused.
- Diffuse thinking: Relaxed thinking style.
- Focused mode: If you're familiar with something, you hit your old neural pathways.
- If you haven't thought the thought you are trying to learn, then how would you think about it?
- To get to the pattern you want to think about, try to think about things broadly. You can make new neural connections by not thinking about things too tightly.
- You can't be both focused and diffused.

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

- Salvador Dali--technique was relaxing in a chair, holding a key, and letting the key fall when he slept, and it would wake him up, after which he can paint his stuff.
- Thomas Edison--sitting in his chair with the ball bearings, waking him up also.
- Similar to how you lift weights gradually to build musculature, you do a little work every day to build you neuro-scaffold.

#### Summary

- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning.
- Focused and diffused modes.
- Learning something difficult takes time.

## What is Learning?

- The brain weighs 3 lbs but it consumes 10 times more energy by weight than the rest of the body. It is the most complex device in the known universe.
- Seeing, hearing, reaching, running, are beyond the capability of the world's fastest digital computers.
- Brain influences: thought processes, memory, emotions, motivation.
- Default mode network: parts of the brain active when resting.
- There are a million billion synapses in the brain.
- Brain connectivity is dynamic, even if it is mature.
- How do memories stay stable even after so many years? New synapses actually get formed, they don't replace the old ones (?).
- Learning changes the structure of the brain. You are not the same person after a night's sleep or after a nap. You get a better brain!
- Shakespeare: Sleep knits the fabric of your thoughts.

#### A Procrastination Preview

- Pomodoro technique.

#### Practice Makes Permanent

- Why is Math/Science hard? It's because things like cow can be seen. For math, there are no things like 1, 2, +, etc. Even words like love, zest, hope are abstract but they are emotions that we can feel. This is why you have to practice math things.
- The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice. Even if concepts are abstract, your practice is not. Practicing something deepens a neural pattern. Study things hard by focusing them intently. Take a break and let your brain go to diffuse mode. Learn a little everyday, do not cram since the mental foundation won't be as stable as it is supposed to be.

#### Introduction to Memory

- Long term memory/working memory.
- Not 7, but 4 is the number of chunks that we can hold.
- Need to repeat things a lot to get working memory to work.
- Different kinds of long term memory are stored in different parts of the brain.
- Long term memories are important because that's where you store techniques. You want to move things from the working memory to long term memory.
- *Spaced repetition*: Repeat things over a number of days. Same as building the brick wall, you need time to get the synaptic connections to form.

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

- When you sleep, your brain cells shrink/increase space between brain cells. This is your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy.
- Too little sleep leads to headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes, and just plain dying earlier.
- During sleep, your brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning.
- The deactivation of the conscious you helps other areas of your brain to talk more easily to one another. But do focused mode work first.
- *If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it.* If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material, it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it still further.

#### Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

- I believe in learning by doing, and learning by osmosis from people who are experts.
- There isn't a simple way to keep yourself attending something that you're not interested in.
- I can ask a question to the speaker. This can sometimes give rise to a discussion that is more interesting. You learn more by active engagement.
- Jogging/exercise is a wonderful way to get the mind disengaged from the normal train of thought. The problem is remembering all of those ideas. This is why I take a little notebook with me so I can remember what it is what I was thinking about.
- I enjoy the evenings when the hubbub of the day quiets down, and I get a chance to get into a more reflective mode, and that's when I actually get my best work done.
- Multitasking is being to be able to switch back/forth and context switching. I can switch back and forth. It is an enormously productive environment that I am in.
- All the neurons that you have in your brain, you had at birth. Some neurons die, causing the shrinkage of your cortex.
- If you have an animal and if you give it an enriched environment, the strength of the connections between neurons is much stronger there, it can be made by a factor or two.
- Exercise will also increase the number of neurons being born and survive. My brain is helping me remember things because I have new neurons being born, and surviving in my hippocampus.
- Your brain needs pause/using muscles instead of brain to process your information and get the neurons working on it. We need to have our children out there running around.
- Being in a creative environment, where other people are creative is a way of enhancing your own creativity.
- *The image that we have of the creative thinking being isolated may be true of some people, but its not true of me.* Having people to bounce my ideas off of is a very important part of doing science.
- You can become a better test taker. Don't hung up if you can't answer a question. The answer to the problem may pop into your brain later in the test.
- Having youth around is a great way to keep yourself youthful.
- *Success isn't necessarily come by being smart. Passion and persistence. A lot of success in life is that passion and persistence, staying, working on it, and not letting go. This is the most important quality that I see in students that I work with who are successful.*
- Francis Crick's brain is huge!

## Chunking

## What is a Chunk?

- Chunking is the mental thing that helps you unite things.
- Working memory lives in the pre-frontal cortex.
- When you are stressed, your attention octopus has harder time forming a connection.
- Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning and use.
- 'p o p' is chunked as 'pop'.
- Neurons fire and wire the sound of "mama" and your mother's face.
- The best programs for learning language incorporate focused/rote learning with diffused learning/native speakers. As it turns out, one of the first steps to gain knowledge in academic is to learn chunks.
- Same with sports, music, dance, anything that humans can get good at. Focused practice and repetition helps you to create chunks.
- Small chunks become bigger, and as you master material, you get to become better at being creative.

## How to Form a Chunk

- Playing a guitar: the neural representation of the song in your mind is considered as a large chunk.
- You have to grasp parts of the song tat become neuro mini-chunks, which will later join together into larger chunks.
- Same with sports. You create mini chunks which you combine together.
- The best chunks are so well-ingrained that you don't actually think about it when you put them together.
- In language learning, often just saying a single word with the proper nuance, tone, and action requires a ton of practice.
- Stringing sentences together makes good chunks.
- Learning math/science involves the same approach. This is why you are given sample problems and solutions. It's like you are forcing the learning by showing examples of how to solve it.

- Chunking is different in the subject of history than in the subject of chunking in chemistry or in karate.
- The first step in chunking is to focus your undivided attention on the thing you want to chunk. Brain must focus on chunking the new material. You are making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread through many areas of the brain.
- Understanding is like a super glue that links things together. Can you create a chunk if you don't understand?
- It's important to realize that just understanding how a problem was solve does not create a chunk. *This is why you can grasp an idea when the teacher did it, but you can't solve in on your own.* This is why closing the book and trying to solve the problem is helpful. When you can actually solve the thing, it's better. DO IT YOURSELF.
- Third step: Gaining context so you can see not only how but when to use the chunk. Need to see more broadly, practicing with both related and unrelated problems so you can see when to use it and when not to use it. If you don't know when to use the tool, it will be harder.
- Learning: bottom-up learning/chunking to learn things individually, and a top-down learning/big picture that allows you to see what you are learning.
- *Context is where bottom up and top down meet.* Context means when to use that technique instead of that technique.
- Check chapter pictures and headings to figure out how the chapter was actually chunked. Learn major concepts first. Once you have this done, fill in the details.
- Focused attention, understanding, and practice.

## Illusions of Competence

- Mistake: Rereading notes. Better to just recall. Look away and think about what you can recall about what you just read.
- In the same amount of time, by simply practicing and recalling, students learned far more and at a much deeper level.
- *The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning.* The students themselves thought that concept mapping or diagrams would be the best but recall was better.
- Recall, rather than passive rereading, would make your thing more effective.
- You can combine this with spaced repetition.
- As you being to chunk a concept, the things are smoother in your mind and the chunk becomes one slot of memory. The rest of your working memory is left clear. It's as if the smart and working memory is a hyperlink that is connected to a webpage.
- This is why YOU are the one doing the problem you are solving. You can't just look at the solution because the solution is not really yours.
- You must have the information persisting in your memory if you are to master the material enough to perform well in tests.
- Highlighting has to be done carefully. One sentence per paragraph.
- Because it can be easier to look at a book rather than reading, students persist with their illusions. This is why reading doesn't make sure that you are learning.
- Test yourself on what you are learning. Bit by bit, mistakes help you correct your thinking by helping you get better.
- *Recalling material outside of your place of study can help you.* You can have subliminal cues from the location when you were studying the thing.
- You can create a chunk even if you don't understand, but it's often a useless chunk that wouldn't fit in with whatever you are learning.

## What Motivates You?

- Neuromodulators--carry information not about the content of an experience but it's importance and value to your future.
- Acetylcholine--for focused learning. These project widely and activate circuits that contain synaptic plasticity leading to long term memory.
- Dopamine--for reward learning. Dopamine signals project widely and also affect decision making. Dopamine predicts future rewards and not just the immediate reward.
- This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will lead to a much better reward in the future.
- Opposite to addictive drugs. *Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool your brain into thinking that something wonderful has just happened.*
- Loss of dopamine=lack of motivation, which becomes anhedonia (a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure).
- Severe loss of dopamine causes Parkinson's disease, and leads to catatonia (a complete lack of movement).
- *When you promise to treat yourself after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system.*
- Serotonin--affects your social life. In monkeys, the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels.
- Prozac (prescribed for clinical depression) raises the level of Serotonin activity.
- Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society.
- *Emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.*
- Amygdala--where cognition and emotion are integrated. Part of the limbic system which is involved in processing memory and decision making.

## The Value of a Library of Chunks

- What people do to enhance their expertise is to increase the number of chunks in their mind.
- Chess masters have a lot of position patterns in their mind. Same with other professions.
- Chunks can help you understand new concepts. When you grasp one, you can relate it to other fields (*transfer*).
- Some aspects of language learning are useful when you learn computer programming.
- Better to have a good library of chunks. As you build each chunk, it is filling in part of your larger knowledge picture.
- In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize specific concepts/different types of concepts. You'll find patterns for simplified problem solving.
- *Sequential reasoning:* Focused mode.
- *Holistic reasoning:* Diffused/intuition. The semi-random way of making solutions should be verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't necessarily correct.
- Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

## Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

- If you choke on tests or public speaking, you might want to repeat things.
- People can practice up to 70 hours for a 20 minute TED talk.
- Sometimes too much practice on one thing is bad. Repeating something you know perfectly well is easy and you will have the illusion of competence.
- You want to focus on what you think is difficult. Deliberate practice.
- Einstellung: Your initial thought may prevent a better idea or solution from being found.
 The previous patterns that you built might be preventing you from thinking of a better solution. It's like you installed a roadblock with your initial intuition.
- Understanding where to obtain real solutions is important in learning and in life. Practice jumping back and forth between situations that require different solutions (*interleaving*).
- Math/science: Pick out why some problems call for one technique and why some call for another.
- Interleaving builds flexibility and creativity. It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and you begin thinking independently. You can make better connections between chunks of different fields.
- "Science progresses one funeral at a time".
- When you teach a child how to deal with a bully, or you fix a faucet, or you pack for a trip, that's where you use your learning skill and that might be where you learn something new.

## Chunking: Summing It Up

- Chunks are pieces of information bound together with use/meaning.
- Think of it as neurons that are used together.
- Build chunks with: focused attention, understanding, and practice.
- Simple recall is one of the best ways to improve chunking.
- Change your physical location to improve chunking.
- Transfer is when chunks in one area help chunks in other areas.
- Interleave your learning by practicing different techniques in one session.
- Test yourself to see if you are actually learning the material or not.
- Minimize highlighting because it just seems that you are getting when you are not.
- Mistakes are good.
- Use deliberate practice. Practice the hard things to gain full mastery of the material.
- Einstellung is when your initial thought/pattern prevents a better idea/solution from being found.
- The Law of Serendipity.
