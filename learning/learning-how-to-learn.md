## Focused vs. Diffuse Thinking

- Modes of thinking: focused and diffused.
- Diffuse thinking: Relaxed thinking style.
- Focused mode: If you're familiar with something, you hit your old neural pathways.
- If you haven't thought the thought you are trying to learn, then how would you think about it?
- To get to the pattern you want to think about, try to think about things broadly. You can make new neural connections by not thinking about things too tightly.
- You can't be both focused and diffused.

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

- Salvador Dali--technique was relaxing in a chair, holding a key, and letting the key fall when he slept, and it would wake him up, after which he can paint his stuff.
- Thomas Edison--sitting in his chair with the ball bearings, waking him up also.
- Similar to how you lift weights gradually to build musculature, you do a little work every day to build you neuro-scaffold.

#### Summary

- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning.
- Focused and diffused modes.
- Learning something difficult takes time.

## What is Learning?

- The brain weighs 3 lbs but it consumes 10 times more energy by weight than the rest of the body. It is the most complex device in the known universe.
- Seeing, hearing, reaching, running, are beyond the capability of the world's fastest digital computers.
- Brain influences: thought processes, memory, emotions, motivation.
- Default mode network: parts of the brain active when resting.
- There are a million billion synapses in the brain.
- Brain connectivity is dynamic, even if it is mature.
- How do memories stay stable even after so many years? New synapses actually get formed, they don't replace the old ones (?).
- Learning changes the structure of the brain. You are not the same person after a night's sleep or after a nap. You get a better brain!
- Shakespeare: Sleep knits the fabric of your thoughts.

#### A Procrastination Preview

- Pomodoro technique.

#### Practice Makes Permanent

- Why is Math/Science hard? It's because things like cow can be seen. For math, there are no things like 1, 2, +, etc. Even words like love, zest, hope are abstract but they are emotions that we can feel. This is why you have to practice math things.
- The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice. Even if concepts are abstract, your practice is not. Practicing something deepens a neural pattern. Study things hard by focusing them intently. Take a break and let your brain go to diffuse mode. Learn a little everyday, do not cram since the mental foundation won't be as stable as it is supposed to be.

#### Introduction to Memory

- Long term memory/working memory.
- Not 7, but 4 is the number of chunks that we can hold.
- Need to repeat things a lot to get working memory to work.
- Different kinds of long term memory are stored in different parts of the brain.
- Long term memories are important because that's where you store techniques. You want to move things from the working memory to long term memory.
- *Spaced repetition*: Repeat things over a number of days. Same as building the brick wall, you need time to get the synaptic connections to form.

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

- When you sleep, your brain cells shrink/increase space between brain cells. This is your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy.
- Too little sleep leads to headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes, and just plain dying earlier.
- During sleep, your brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning.
- The deactivation of the conscious you helps other areas of your brain to talk more easily to one another. But do focused mode work first.
- *If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it.* If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material, it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it still further.

#### Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

- I believe in learning by doing, and learning by osmosis from people who are experts.
- There isn't a simple way to keep yourself attending something that you're not interested in.
- I can ask a question to the speaker. This can sometimes give rise to a discussion that is more interesting. You learn more by active engagement.
- Jogging/exercise is a wonderful way to get the mind disengaged from the normal train of thought. The problem is remembering all of those ideas. This is why I take a little notebook with me so I can remember what it is what I was thinking about.
- I enjoy the evenings when the hubbub of the day quiets down, and I get a chance to get into a more reflective mode, and that's when I actually get my best work done.
- Multitasking is being to be able to switch back/forth and context switching. I can switch back and forth. It is an enormously productive environment that I am in.
- All the neurons that you have in your brain, you had at birth. Some neurons die, causing the shrinkage of your cortex.
- If you have an animal and if you give it an enriched environment, the strength of the connections between neurons is much stronger there, it can be made by a factor or two.
- Exercise will also increase the number of neurons being born and survive. My brain is helping me remember things because I have new neurons being born, and surviving in my hippocampus.
- Your brain needs pause/using muscles instead of brain to process your information and get the neurons working on it. We need to have our children out there running around.
- Being in a creative environment, where other people are creative is a way of enhancing your own creativity.
- *The image that we have of the creative thinking being isolated may be true of some people, but its not true of me.* Having people to bounce my ideas off of is a very important part of doing science.
- You can become a better test taker. Don't hung up if you can't answer a question. The answer to the problem may pop into your brain later in the test.
- Having youth around is a great way to keep yourself youthful.
- *Success isn't necessarily come by being smart. Passion and persistence. A lot of success in life is that passion and persistence, staying, working on it, and not letting go. This is the most important quality that I see in students that I work with who are successful.*
- Francis Crick's brain is huge!

## Chunking

## What is a Chunk?

- Chunking is the mental thing that helps you unite things.
- Working memory lives in the pre-frontal cortex.
- When you are stressed, your attention octopus has harder time forming a connection.
- Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning and use.
- 'p o p' is chunked as 'pop'.
- Neurons fire and wire the sound of "mama" and your mother's face.
- The best programs for learning language incorporate focused/rote learning with diffused learning/native speakers. As it turns out, one of the first steps to gain knowledge in academic is to learn chunks.
- Same with sports, music, dance, anything that humans can get good at. Focused practice and repetition helps you to create chunks.
- Small chunks become bigger, and as you master material, you get to become better at being creative.

## How to Form a Chunk

- Playing a guitar: the neural representation of the song in your mind is considered as a large chunk.
- You have to grasp parts of the song tat become neuro mini-chunks, which will later join together into larger chunks.
- Same with sports. You create mini chunks which you combine together.
- The best chunks are so well-ingrained that you don't actually think about it when you put them together.
- In language learning, often just saying a single word with the proper nuance, tone, and action requires a ton of practice.
- Stringing sentences together makes good chunks.
- Learning math/science involves the same approach. This is why you are given sample problems and solutions. It's like you are forcing the learning by showing examples of how to solve it.

- Chunking is different in the subject of history than in the subject of chunking in chemistry or in karate.
- The first step in chunking is to focus your undivided attention on the thing you want to chunk. Brain must focus on chunking the new material. You are making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread through many areas of the brain.
- Understanding is like a super glue that links things together. Can you create a chunk if you don't understand?
- It's important to realize that just understanding how a problem was solve does not create a chunk. *This is why you can grasp an idea when the teacher did it, but you can't solve in on your own.* This is why closing the book and trying to solve the problem is helpful. When you can actually solve the thing, it's better. DO IT YOURSELF.
- Third step: Gaining context so you can see not only how but when to use the chunk. Need to see more broadly, practicing with both related and unrelated problems so you can see when to use it and when not to use it. If you don't know when to use the tool, it will be harder.
- Learning: bottom-up learning/chunking to learn things individually, and a top-down learning/big picture that allows you to see what you are learning.
- *Context is where bottom up and top down meet.* Context means when to use that technique instead of that technique.
- Check chapter pictures and headings to figure out how the chapter was actually chunked. Learn major concepts first. Once you have this done, fill in the details.
- Focused attention, understanding, and practice.

## Illusions of Competence

- Mistake: Rereading notes. Better to just recall. Look away and think about what you can recall about what you just read.
- In the same amount of time, by simply practicing and recalling, students learned far more and at a much deeper level.
- *The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning.* The students themselves thought that concept mapping or diagrams would be the best but recall was better.
- Recall, rather than passive rereading, would make your thing more effective.
- You can combine this with spaced repetition.
- As you being to chunk a concept, the things are smoother in your mind and the chunk becomes one slot of memory. The rest of your working memory is left clear. It's as if the smart and working memory is a hyperlink that is connected to a webpage.
- This is why YOU are the one doing the problem you are solving. You can't just look at the solution because the solution is not really yours.
- You must have the information persisting in your memory if you are to master the material enough to perform well in tests.
- Highlighting has to be done carefully. One sentence per paragraph.
- Because it can be easier to look at a book rather than reading, students persist with their illusions. This is why reading doesn't make sure that you are learning.
- Test yourself on what you are learning. Bit by bit, mistakes help you correct your thinking by helping you get better.
- *Recalling material outside of your place of study can help you.* You can have subliminal cues from the location when you were studying the thing.
- You can create a chunk even if you don't understand, but it's often a useless chunk that wouldn't fit in with whatever you are learning.

## What Motivates You?

- Neuromodulators--carry information not about the content of an experience but it's importance and value to your future.
- Acetylcholine--for focused learning. These project widely and activate circuits that contain synaptic plasticity leading to long term memory.
- Dopamine--for reward learning. Dopamine signals project widely and also affect decision making. Dopamine predicts future rewards and not just the immediate reward.
- This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will lead to a much better reward in the future.
- Opposite to addictive drugs. *Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool your brain into thinking that something wonderful has just happened.*
- Loss of dopamine=lack of motivation, which becomes anhedonia (a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure).
- Severe loss of dopamine causes Parkinson's disease, and leads to catatonia (a complete lack of movement).
- *When you promise to treat yourself after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system.*
- Serotonin--affects your social life. In monkeys, the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels.
- Prozac (prescribed for clinical depression) raises the level of Serotonin activity.
- Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society.
- *Emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.*
- Amygdala--where cognition and emotion are integrated. Part of the limbic system which is involved in processing memory and decision making.

## The Value of a Library of Chunks

- What people do to enhance their expertise is to increase the number of chunks in their mind.
- Chess masters have a lot of position patterns in their mind. Same with other professions.
- Chunks can help you understand new concepts. When you grasp one, you can relate it to other fields (*transfer*).
- Some aspects of language learning are useful when you learn computer programming.
- Better to have a good library of chunks. As you build each chunk, it is filling in part of your larger knowledge picture.
- In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize specific concepts/different types of concepts. You'll find patterns for simplified problem solving.
- *Sequential reasoning:* Focused mode.
- *Holistic reasoning:* Diffused/intuition. The semi-random way of making solutions should be verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't necessarily correct.
- Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

## Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

- If you choke on tests or public speaking, you might want to repeat things.
- People can practice up to 70 hours for a 20 minute TED talk.
- Sometimes too much practice on one thing is bad. Repeating something you know perfectly well is easy and you will have the illusion of competence.
- You want to focus on what you think is difficult. Deliberate practice.
- Einstellung: Your initial thought may prevent a better idea or solution from being found.
 The previous patterns that you built might be preventing you from thinking of a better solution. It's like you installed a roadblock with your initial intuition.
- Understanding where to obtain real solutions is important in learning and in life. Practice jumping back and forth between situations that require different solutions (*interleaving*).
- Math/science: Pick out why some problems call for one technique and why some call for another.
- Interleaving builds flexibility and creativity. It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and you begin thinking independently. You can make better connections between chunks of different fields.
- "Science progresses one funeral at a time".
- When you teach a child how to deal with a bully, or you fix a faucet, or you pack for a trip, that's where you use your learning skill and that might be where you learn something new.

## Chunking: Summing It Up

- Chunks are pieces of information bound together with use/meaning.
- Think of it as neurons that are used together.
- Build chunks with: focused attention, understanding, and practice.
- Simple recall is one of the best ways to improve chunking.
- Change your physical location to improve chunking.
- Transfer is when chunks in one area help chunks in other areas.
- Interleave your learning by practicing different techniques in one session.
- Test yourself to see if you are actually learning the material or not.
- Minimize highlighting because it just seems that you are getting when you are not.
- Mistakes are good.
- Use deliberate practice. Practice the hard things to gain full mastery of the material.
- Einstellung is when your initial thought/pattern prevents a better idea/solution from being found.
- The Law of Serendipity.

## Procrastination and Memory

- Building solid chunks in long term memory takes time. You do not want to put this off until the last moment.
- One tool: Pomodoro technique.
- Inner zombies: The routine your brain goes through that want to focus on making the here and now better.
- Not all procrastination is bad.
- Good learning is a bit by bit activity. You want to avoid cramming.
- Willpower uses a lot of neural resources. You shouldn't use willpower to vent off procrastination unless you need to.
- Procrastination: Unhappy feeling -> funneling attention onto a more pleasant task -> feel happy -> feel bad about what just happened.
- Procrastination offers temporary excitement/relief from boring reality.
- You'll create stories and devise irrational excuses that sounds reasonable (if I study too early I'll forget the thing).
- The higher you go in your studies, the more important it is to fight procrastination.
- YOU should be making the decision, not your zombies.
- Procrastinators just put off one little thing, then they get used to it, but the long term effects are not so good.

## Zombies Everywhere

- Backing out of the driveway for the first time is hard. But once you've chunked it, it becomes easy. Same with riding a bicycle.
- Chunking is related habit. Habit is an energy saver for us.
- You get into a habitual zombie mode. The thing about habit is that you don't think about it, so it saves you energy.
- Four parts of habits
  - The cue. This is the trigger that launches your zombie mode. Text message -> "stop work".
  - The routine. The brain's habitual response when it receives the cue.
  - The reward. Every habit develops/continues because it gives us some element of pleasure. Find a way to reward good study habits.
  - The belief. Habits have power because of your belief in them. To change a habit, you need to change your underlying habit.

## Process Vs. Product

- When it comes to learning in general, it's perfectly normal to experience negative emotions. It's how you handle the thing. Non-procrastinators put their negative feelings aside with things like "quit wasting time and just get on with it, you'll feel better about it".
- If you find yourself avoiding tasks, you can reframe things.
- Focus on process: the flow of time and the habits/actions associated with that time. Product is "a homework assignment that I have to finish". Your attention should be related to processes/habits.
- Avoid focusing on answering the questions. Focus on the small chunks over time to answer the questions or tests. The whole point is you calmly put forth your best forth in this small time period.
- This is why a Pomodoro is nice because you focus on the time but not on the task.
- The zombie likes processes because it can focus on this thing. So focus on a process rather on a product, you let yourself relax into the flow of the work.
- When a distraction arises, just let it flow by. Quiet spaces or noise cancelling headphones can be really helpful when they're trying to concentrate.

## Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You

- You want to just overwrite parts of a habit.
- Look to change your reaction to the cue.
  - The cue. Recognize what launches you into the zombie procrastination mode. Location, time, how you feel, reactions. Is it a web surfing thing, or a text message, or what? Prevent the most damaging cues by shutting off your phone or keeping yourself from the Internet.
  - The routine. To rewire, develop a plan. Remove potent distractions. These can be something like finding your favorite chair, finding your favorite place, and savor your victories when they work. Pomodoro can work here.
  - The reward. Why are you procrastinating? How about getting yourself a feeling of pride or sense of satisfaction when you finished the thing? Remember that habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. *Only when your brain starts expecting a reward would the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits.* The better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.
  - The belief. You may find that when the going gets stressful, you long to want to go back to bad habits. Hang out with like-minded people.

## Juggling Life and Learning

- Once a week, write a list of key tasks.
- Write a daily to-do list during the evening before so you can enlist your zombies subconsciously for the day.
- By moving to Pomodoro mode, I've switched to a process orientation.
- I use things like cleaning to be diffused learning breaks.
- With experience, you'll find out how fast tasks take.
- Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time.
- Cal Newport: 5pm quitting time.
- Work on the most important/most disliked task first.
- Remember: Planning well is trying. Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

## Summary

- Planing Journal.
- Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
- Arrange your work into a series of small challenges.
- Make sure your zombies have rewards.
- Delay rewards until you finish the task.
- Watch for procrastination cues.
- Put yourself in new locations.
- Gain trust in your new system.
- Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate.
- Eat your frogs first.

## Diving Deeper into Memory

- A mind is built to retain general information about a place. You can enhance your ability to remember if you tap into this visual memory. Our ancestors needed to remember locations but not names/numbers, after all.
- Images connect to your right hemisphere. The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses, the easier it is to remember.
- Idea should be memorable: "flying mule bringing f=ma to the couch".
- Writing or saying what you're trying to learn seems to retain the thing.
- The more you can term what you're trying to memorize in something memorable, the easier things could be.
- Index cards.
- Great flash card systems like Anki have spaced repetition algorithms.

## What is Long Term Memory?

- At the age of 27, Mr. HM had an operation which took out his hippocampus. His epilepsy was cured, but he can no longer remember new things.
- You can have a normal conversation with HM, but after a few minutes, he can't remember who you are or what you talked about.
- He can learn motor skills but he cannot remember how he learned it.
- Hippocampus: Without it and its inputs, we can't remember things.
- Memories are not fixed, but are living, breathing parts of your brain that are changing all the time.
- Memories can be reconsolidated.
- By suggesting or imagining, you can change memories. You can recall an old memory with a new context.
- This is why it is effective to space-learn. You may retrieve something during the exam, but it will fade from memory.
- Glial cells/astrocytes: When human astrocytes were put into mice, they were better. Einstein had more astrocytes than the normal human.
- Astrocytes: Provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extracellular ion balance, and are involved with repair following injury.

## Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

- Better to associate numbers with a year you know. 11 = 100 meter dash. 18 = debut. 104 = "old but happy great grandma."
- Medicine: acronyms to memorize hand bones or cranial bones.
- Memory palace technique: Grouping things you want to remember. This is good to remember unrelated items like a grocery list. Think that you are in the place with the mental images of a bunch of things that you want to remember.
- This is hard at first but after, you can be fast.
- The memory process itself becomes an exercise in creativity. This is because you are creating wild/unexpected possibilities of neural connections.
- As you begin to internalize parts of the material, you come to understand it more deeply.

## Summing Up Memory

- 2 main memory systems: Long term memory/storage warehouse. Extend practice to several days to build better memories.
- Working memory: Just 4 things. This is why you make to-do lists, so they don't occupy your memory list.
- To begin tapping into your visual memory system, make a memorable visual image about a concept you want to remember.
- Meaningful groups: Associate numbers with years or acronyms.
- Memory palace.
- By memorizing material you understand, you are reinforcing the concept that you want to learn.

## How to Become a Better Learner

- Physical exercise. In a few places, new neurons are born every day. One of these places is in the hippocampus.
- New neurons die if you don't rescue them. Exercise is more effective than any other drug in the market for improving your learning. Gym and recess are important parts of the curriculum.
- Critical period for first language acquisition: puberty.
- You can apparently fix lack of depth perception with practice. Practice can repair or train the brain.
- Zombies can't learn. Learning, planning, language, these are what makes us human.
- Until this happens, there may be a little bit of zombie in you.
- Learning is too important to be left behind in the classroom.

## Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

- Learn using metaphor and analogy
- Learning doesn't progress logically. It's not like everyday you do something. Sometimes you hit a wall. This seems to happen when your mind restructures its understanding. (Ex: learning foreign languages.) This is a natural phenomenon, wherein your mind s wrestling deeply with the material.

## Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy

- The more visual, the better. Ex: Visualize electrical current as water, electrical power as a push.
- When chemists began to understand the structure of molecules, they used metaphors.
- Pretend that you are the concept you are trying to understand.
- Chemistry: cation = cat = paws = positive. Anion = negative = onion = makes you cry.
- Metaphors are good to get out of Einstellung (being blocked by your way of thinking).

## No Need for Genius Envy

- Science vs Athletics: You don't get to know how to hit a baseball in a day. You repeat/chunk it. In the same way, once you do something in math/science, you don't have to keep explaining the how to yourself.
- At some point you just figure out that you add exponents. By doing things a lot, you figure out the HOW in addition to the WHY.
- People learn by trying to make sense of the information they perceive.
- Experts have to make fast decisions by dealing with the consolidation of chunks.
- Are they necessarily gifted? Well, intelligence and chunking memory slots does matter to some degree. However, it does make you lees creative using Einstellung. A superb memory can hold its thoughts more securely.
- Having a somewhat smaller working memory can make you more creative. If things aren't locked up more tightly, you can get more ideas from other parts of your brain.
- It is practice, particularly DELIBERATE practice on the hardest part of the material, that can lift your mental ability.
- Imposter syndrome: If you suffer from feelings of inadequacy, remember that most people feel them too.

## Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life

- Santiago Cajal--juvenile delinquent who became the father of neuroscience.
- Myelin sheaths are said to not fully form until your twenties.
- When you use neural circuits/practice things, you improve your myelin sheaths.
- It seems people can enhance the development of their neural circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons.
- Cajal: "Although brilliant people can do exceptional work, they can be careless and biased."
- Anyone can change their own brain so even the least gifted can produce an abundant harvest.
- Charles Darwin was a poor student in school. Out on his own, Darwin was able to look with fresh eyes at the data he was collecting.
- There will always be those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make.
- If you flunk a test, you may also encounter critics who say you don't have what it takes.
- Tune people out if you discover that their interests lie in undercutting you.
- Mastering such dispassion can be difficult--not everyone is naturally good hearted towards us.
- Take pride in aiming your success because of the very things that make other people say you can't do it. Take pride in who you are, especially the qualities that make you different, and use them as a secret talisman for success. Use your natural contrariness to defy the always present prejudices from others about what you accomplish.

## The Value of Teamwork

- Broad-perspective perceptual disorder: They can still function, but only partially. They can retain their intelligence if it was a skill they've had before. But an interesting anomaly, they would conclude something nonsensical, such as that a hot dog stand had a profit and loss statement with a loss of nearly a billion dollars. There's no "hmm that answer doesn't make sense".
- The right hemisphere helps us step back and put our work into big picture perspective. People with damage to the right hemisphere are unable to gain "aha" insights. People with strokes can remind us of the dangers of not using our full cognitive abilities, which involve many areas of our brain.
- The right h serves as a devil's advocate, while the left h tries to cling tenaciously to the way things were. The left h interprets the world for us and will go to great lengths to keep those interpretations unchanging.
- Problem with the focus, left h leaning mode of analysis is that is provides analytical, but rigid/dogmatic/egocentric approach.
- Step back and recheck to make sure you use both hemispheres.
- YOU are the easiest person to fool.
- This is why it's good to work with other people. After all, every one has blind spots.
- Friends and teammates can serve as a larger scale diffuse mode. The importance of working with others doesn't just relate to learning.

## A Test Checklist

- The effort you put into test-taking is of fundamental importance.
- Testing has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind.
- Checklist by Richard Felder:
  - Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
  - Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check your solutions with others?
  - Did you participate actively in homework group discussions contributing ideas and asking questions? Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something?
  - Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were handed in?
  - Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren't clear to you?
  - If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you could do everything on it?
  - Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time on the Algebra in calculations?
  - Did you go over the study guide and problems with class mates and quiz one another?
  - If there was a review session before the test, did you attend and asked questions about anything you weren't sure about?
  - And lastly, did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?

## Hard Start--Jump to Easy

- Better to concentrate on tough problems first (especially with concentrating on focus mode immediately).
- Start on the hard problems then jump to the easy ones. You put the hard thing in mind then you switch attention from it/diffuse mode.
- When you return to the more difficult problems, you'll be pleased that the next steps may be obvious.
- It's like while you are waiting for the steak to fry, you can slice tomatoes, or season the soup.
- The problem is that you have the self-discipline to pull yourself off the problem after you find yourself stuck for a minute or two.
- Sometimes people are concerned that starting a problem and then pulling away might cause confusion on an examination.

## Final Helpful Hints for Tests

- The story you tell yourself about why you're stressed makes all the difference.
- Shift your thinking from "this test has made me afraid" to "this test has got me excited to do my best".
- Momentarily turn your attention to your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath.
- Multiple choice questions: Cover them up first and try to recall.
- If a practice test is easier, why is it? Maybe you had an answer key at hand.
- Plan B for the alternate career: once you have a plan for the worst possible contingency, you will be surprised that the fear will begin to subside.
- Good worry/bad worry: Good worry helps provide motivation and focus, bad worry just wastes energy.
- The day before the test, look over the materials to brush up on them. Don't push your brain too hard, you won't run a ten mile race the day before running a marathon.
- Checking your answers from different perspectives provides an opportunity for verifying what you've done.
- When checking your work, if you start more towards the back, it seems to give your brain a good perspective.

## Summary

- To understand concepts, create a metaphor (the more visual, the better).
- If you change your thoughts, you can change your life.
- Take pride in aiming for success because of the things that make other people say you can't do it.
- Check your work.
- Overconfidence in your results can result from one mode of thinking.
- Taking a test is serious business, so make a test preparation checklist.
- Hard start jump to easy technique.
- Change your interpretation of stress to work for you? Make it "this test has got me excited to do my best".
- If you're panicked on a test, momentarily turn your attention to your breathing.
- Whenever possible, you should blink, shift your attention, and double check your answers using a big picture perspective.
