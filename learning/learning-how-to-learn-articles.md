## The 30 Second Habit That Can Have a Big Impact On Your Life

*Immediately after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, take 30 seconds to write down the most important points.*

## Be Lucky--It's an Easy Skill to Learn
[Reference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3304496/Be-lucky-its-an-easy-skill-to-learn.html)

- Although unlucky people have almost no insight into the real causes of their good and bad luck, their thoughts and behavior are responsible for much of their fortune.
- Unlucky people are generally more tense than lucky people, and research has shown that anxiety disrupts people's ability to notice the unexpected.
- *Unlucky people miss chance opportunities because they are too focused on looking for something else.* They go to parties to find their perfect partner and so miss opportunities to find certain good friends. They look through newspapers determined to find certain types of job advertisements and miss other types of jobs. Lucky people are more relaxed and open, and see what is there rather than what they are looking for.

#### 4 Basic Principles

- Skilled in creating and noticing chance opportunities.
- Make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition.
- Create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations.
- Adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.

- Luck school: Make people think and behave like a lucky person.
- 80% of people were now happier, more satisfied with their lives, and perhaps most important of all, luckier.

- Unlucky people often fail to follow their intuition when making a choice, whereas lucky people tend to respect hunches.
- Lucky people are interested in how they both think and feel about the various options, rather than simply looking at the rational side of the situation.
- Gut feelings act as an alarm bell--a reason to consider a decision carefully.
- Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine. Many lucky people try to introduce variety into their lives.
- Lucky people tend to see the positive side of their ill fortune. They imagine how things could have been worse.

## Divided Attention

- Until recently, students at lease knew when they had checked out. A student today who moves his attention from texting to lecture to Facebook may *feel* buzzed and alert, but probably didn't absorb as much of the lesson as he think he did.
- Heavy multitaskers are often confident in their abilities, but they might actually be worse at multitasking than other people.
- Attention: 2 overlapping but neurologically distinct systems: one of controlled attention, and one of stimulus-driven attention.
- Some people are consistently better than others at concentrating amid distraction.
- At some point, everyone's performance breaks down.
- Does a poor attention system cause poor working-memory performance, or does the causation sometimes work in the other direction?
- Brain region globus pallidus is highly active when people successfully fend off distraction.
- Variability in working-memory capacity  accounts for about half the variability in novel reasoning and reading comprehension.
- Higher-working-memory-capacity people are better to control their attention.
- No notes? You can record the lecture and make that available for the students to review.
- Example of multitasking being slow: Say A to J, then 1 to 10, it will take about 2 seconds each, but A 1 B 2 will take 15-20 seconds.
- Students today don't start in deep attention. They start in hyper attention. The pedagogical challenge will be to combine hyper attention with deep attention and to cultivate both.
- Chronic media multitaskers performed worse than otherwise similar peers on analytic questions drawn from the LSAT.
- *"I don't think that law students in classrooms are sitting there thinking, Boy, I'd rather play Freecell than learn the law," Nass says. "I don't think that's the case. What happens is that there's a moment that comes when you say, Boy, I can do something really easy, or I can do something really hard."*

## Remembering, as an Extreme Sport
[Reference](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/remembering-as-an-extreme-sport/)

- The difference between memory athletes and the rest of us is in a cognitive ability that's not a direct measure of memory, but attention.
- Greek poet Simonides of Ceos is credited with first describing the method.
- Everyone uses the same techniques re: memory palace. Other techniques are not as effective.
- Average IQ: 130. Average study time: 1000-2000 hours and counting.
- The competitors say that "Once any given competition is over, the numbers or words or facts are gone." But the science says they can still recall a significant amount of words they memorized on Day 1.
- But to install a fresh image in the memory palace, they must clear the old one (*attentional control*).
- Stroop test: people see words flashing on a computer with a color in the background. If the word is the same as the color, people are faster.
- Memory athletes are older than students, which means that they should be worse since memory decreases with age, but they do better. While attentional control is not a direct measure of memory, we know that it certainly serves memory.
- *Memory champions are not only exceptional at remembering, but also at forgetting.*
-Remembering and forgetting are not necessarily the enemies of each other.

## Poor health, lifestyle factors linked to memory complaints, even among younger adults
[Reference](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-06-poor-health-lifestyle-factors-linked.html)

- If you're depressed, don't get enough exercise, or have high blood pressure, you may find yourself complaining about memory problems, even if you're a young adult.
- Depression, low levels of education, physical inactivity and high blood pressure increased the likelihood of memory complaints in younger, middle-aged, and older adults.
- Depression was the strongest single risk factor for all memory complaints in all age groups.
- For younger adults, stress may play more of a role, and the ubiquity of technology may impact their attention span, making it harder to focus and remember.
- Education is a key element of "cognitive reserve", the ability to compensate for progressive brain pathology.

## Healthy lifestyle choices mean fewer memory complaints, poll finds
[Reference](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-05-healthy-lifestyle-choices-memory-complaints.html#nRlv)

- Older adults were more likely to report engaging in healthy behaviors than middle-aged and younger adults.
- A higher than expected percentage of young adults complained about their memory.
- More healthy lifestyle behaviors means less likely to complain about memory issues.
- Only 12 percent of older adults smoked, compared with 25 percent of young adults and 24 percent of middle-aged adults.

### How Studying or Working Abroad Makes You Smarter

- Multicultural engagement predicts how "integratively complex" their thinking became.
- Students who adopted an open and adaptive attitude towards foreign cultures became more able to make connections using disparate ideas.
- People who have international experience or identify with more than one nationality are better problem solvers and display more creativity.
- They are also more likely to create new businesses and products and to be promoted.

## This is the kind of music you should listen to at work
[Reference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/02/this-is-the-kind-of-music-you-should-listen-to-at-work/)

- Music is a very powerful management tool if you want to increase not only the efficiency of your workforce, but also their mental state, their emotional state, and how they're going to become more positive about their work.
- Classical music if your work involves numbers or attention to detail.
- Pop music if your work involves data entry or working to deadlines. Best for spell-checking.
- Ambient music (as ignorable as it is interesting). Highest level of accuracy for respondents completing tasks involving equations.
- Dance music if your work involves proof-reading and problem solving.
