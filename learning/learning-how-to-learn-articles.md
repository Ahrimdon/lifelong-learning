- Although unlucky people have almost no insight into the real causes of their good and bad luck, their thoughts and behavior are responsible for much of their fortune.
- Unlucky people are generally more tense than lucky people, and research has shown that anxiety disrupts people's ability to notice the unexpected.
- *Unlucky people miss chance opportunities because they are too focused on looking for something else.* They go to parties to find their perfect partner and so miss opportunities to find certain good friends. They look through newspapers determined to find certain types of job advertisements and miss other types of jobs. Lucky people are more relaxed and open, and see what is there rather than what they are looking for.

#### 4 Basic Principles

- Skilled in creating and noticing chance opportunities.
- Make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition.
- Create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations.
- Adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.

- Luck school: Make people think and behave like a lucky person.
- 80% of people were now happier, more satisfied with their lives, and perhaps most important of all, luckier.

- Unlucky people often fail to follow their intuition when making a choice, whereas lucky people tend to respect hunches.
- Lucky people are interested in how they both think and feel about the various options, rather than simply looking at the rational side of the situation.
- Gut feelings act as an alarm bell--a reason to consider a decision carefully.
- Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine. Many lucky people try to introduce variety into their lives.
- Lucky people tend to see the positive side of their ill fortune. They imagine how things could have been worse.
