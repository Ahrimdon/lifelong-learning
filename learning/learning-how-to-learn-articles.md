*Immediately after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, take 30 seconds to write down the most important points.*

## Be Lucky--It's an Easy Skill to Learn
[Reference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3304496/Be-lucky-its-an-easy-skill-to-learn.html)

- Although unlucky people have almost no insight into the real causes of their good and bad luck, their thoughts and behavior are responsible for much of their fortune.
- Unlucky people are generally more tense than lucky people, and research has shown that anxiety disrupts people's ability to notice the unexpected.
- *Unlucky people miss chance opportunities because they are too focused on looking for something else.* They go to parties to find their perfect partner and so miss opportunities to find certain good friends. They look through newspapers determined to find certain types of job advertisements and miss other types of jobs. Lucky people are more relaxed and open, and see what is there rather than what they are looking for.

#### 4 Basic Principles

- Skilled in creating and noticing chance opportunities.
- Make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition.
- Create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations.
- Adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.

- Luck school: Make people think and behave like a lucky person.
- 80% of people were now happier, more satisfied with their lives, and perhaps most important of all, luckier.

- Unlucky people often fail to follow their intuition when making a choice, whereas lucky people tend to respect hunches.
- Lucky people are interested in how they both think and feel about the various options, rather than simply looking at the rational side of the situation.
- Gut feelings act as an alarm bell--a reason to consider a decision carefully.
- Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine. Many lucky people try to introduce variety into their lives.
- Lucky people tend to see the positive side of their ill fortune. They imagine how things could have been worse.

## Divided Attention

- Until recently, students at lease knew when they had checked out. A student today who moves his attention from texting to lecture to Facebook may *feel* buzzed and alert, but probably didn't absorb as much of the lesson as he think he did.
- Heavy multitaskers are often confident in their abilities, but they might actually be worse at multitasking than other people.
- Attention: 2 overlapping but neurologically distinct systems: one of controlled attention, and one of stimulus-driven attention.
- Some people are consistently better than others at concentrating amid distraction.
- At some point, everyone's performance breaks down.
- Does a poor attention system cause poor working-memory performance, or does the causation sometimes work in the other direction?
- Brain region globus pallidus is highly active when people successfully fend off distraction.
- Variability in working-memory capacity  accounts for about half the variability in novel reasoning and reading comprehension.
- Higher-working-memory-capacity people are better to control their attention.
- No notes? You can record the lecture and make that available for the students to review.
- Example of multitasking being slow: Say A to J, then 1 to 10, it will take about 2 seconds each, but A 1 B 2 will take 15-20 seconds.
- Students today don't start in deep attention. They start in hyper attention. The pedagogical challenge will be to combine hyper attention with deep attention and to cultivate both.
- Chronic media multitaskers performed worse than otherwise similar peers on analytic questions drawn from the LSAT.
- *"I don't think that law students in classrooms are sitting there thinking, Boy, I'd rather play Freecell than learn the law," Nass says. "I don't think that's the case. What happens is that there's a moment that comes when you say, Boy, I can do something really easy, or I can do something really hard."*
