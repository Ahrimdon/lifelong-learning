## The Benjamin Franklin Method of Reading Programming Books

- Expertise is a process of building mental representations. Ex: we don't think about words, we just know them because we are an expert at our alphabet.
- The problem with "just type out the code": there's nothing forcing your mind to represent the program as anything better than a sequence of characters, yet being able to force your mind to do this would mean being able to learn concepts more rapidly.
- Benjamin Franklin: Try to write about what he just learned, without looking at the book.

- Most programming books do not let you pause to reflect. However, if after each chapter, you try to come up with a practical application of the concepts discussed, then you will have a better chance at building a mental model around the topics. Basically, don't be a passive learner. Be an active learner.
- "I grew convinced that Truth, Sincerity and Integrity in Dealings between Man and Man, were of the utmost Importance to the Felicity of Life." I live my life according this. I've regretted many mistakes along the way. I have never regretted telling the truth. I might withhold the truth. I might knowingly let people assume things, but that is their own fault.
- Franklin was told by a friend to stop being so proud, and so he introduced a habit of always being extra modest when espousing his opinions, adding "I imagine" and "perhaps" instead of "undoubtedly" and "certainly." Anyway, he goes on to say while it wasn't a total success, he felt he'd been pretty successful in habituating that modesty for 50 years, but pride is a hard thing to subdue, "for even if I had completely overcome it, I would probably be proud of my humility."
- He ruled up a book with virtues—the ones he wanted to improve in—down the side of the page, the days along the top, and drew black dots at the end of each day next to each virtue he'd lapsed in. And tried to have less black dots with every day.

## Don't copy-paste code. Type it out.

- Cargo cult programming: just copy pasting.
- The most efficient way:
  - Read a piece of code.
  - Understand all features of the language that are being used there.
  - Understand all the features of the libraries/frameworks that are being used there.
  - Learn the basics of those libraries/frameworks.
  - Understand what every line does and the purpose of these libraries/frameworks in the context of that piece of code.
- Blocked practice: learning by performing a single skill over and over.
- Better: Interleaving. When we type the code in different contexts.
- You cannot just copy code without understanding it. Learn from other people's code and practice on top of it. This will maximize your learning ROI.

## Blocked Practice vs. Random Practice: Shake Things up in your Training and in your Life

- Random practice is significantly better than blocked practice.
- Random practice challenges the learner's cognitive and motor systems to deal with the interference of each task on the next.
- Repetitive blocked practice = rote learning. Better performance during training, but less skill transfer to competitions and novel situations.
- It's good to mix up training sessions to keep the body guessing. You can't just practice swings from the same spot over and over and over.
- Do crazy/mix things up from time to time.
