[Reference](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying)

- I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
- I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
- I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
- I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
- I wish that I had let myself be happier.
- Not looking both ways when that truck was coming. <- lol
