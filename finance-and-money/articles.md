# Why are some wealthy people so frugal?

- It's not what you earn, it's what you keep.
- High earners who weren't frugal likely don't have money anymore.
- People purchase obligations (debt), while wealthy people purchase assets (intrinsic value/income producing).
- *Consumer spending = converting hours of your life working into money, and then taking that money and trading it for things that you don't really need or want.*
- Most people waste money on things that don't make them that happy. Is the incremental value of a nicer car really worth the x dollars per month?
- As you start to grow wealth, your expenses and the scope of your problems tend to become larger as well.
- *A wealthy person knows they are just playing a bigger game, with the same rules. They understand those rules better than you do. And then, many of those people will become truly wealthy at one point, which means your income producing assets support your desired lifestyle.*
- Many of us get to buy things to impress others or fit in a specific social cycle. All those behaviors conflict with getting financially independent.
- Fixed costs: Housing, utilities, car bills, credit card bills.
- When you write everything down, it makes you seem cheap, but it also means you have no problem paying a lot of money for what you deem is good value. It's always a good idea to question every expense.
- Wealth: economic + social + intellectual. If you want to become truly wealthy, you need to accumulate all three parts.
- If you're wealthy, simply knowing you could easily afford to drink Starbucks or drive a Porsche is good enough. You don't need to actually do these things to prove a point.
