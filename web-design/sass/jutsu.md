[When to use Sass mixins, extends and variables](https://coderwall.com/p/7p7w2a)

- `@extends`: Use when you want to store multiple static properties.
- `@mixins`: Mixins always generate more rules. So for static rules it is less bloaty to use @extend. You can use mixins for mathy stuff, such as darkening colors.
