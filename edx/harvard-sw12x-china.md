## The Big Picture

#### INTRODUCTION: TIME, SPACE AND IDENTITY

When the Republic was founded, it was a new China, the first new China of the 20th century in 1912. And the Qing was this decadent old empire, now discarded on the ash heap of history. When the People's Republic was founded, it was the New China. Everything before that was Old China, decadent, feudal China. The Cultural Revolution comes in 1966. It's another New China. And everything before the Cultural Revolution is deemed bad and after good, then, of course, the Cultural Revolution itself in 1976 becomes bad, and in 1978 a new era of opening up and reform.

All these new eras actually get old pretty fast, when you think about them, and they do help us understand political changes and shifts of political winds. They don't help us often understand long-term trends and enduring patterns of Chinese history that really matter.

#### Section 1: Time

Dynasty: Physically, an empire. But you also mean the rule of an imperial family. a hierarchy of inner and outer court.

Usual beginning: Military conquest.

High point: Shengshi.

A dynasty is usually the name of a country. Ming != Qing.

So this is the great state of Ming, or the great country of Ming, or the great country of Qing that they're called. It's a royal family, or an imperial family, that passes the rulership on within itself. It's the territory it controls.
And it's the whole government that runs that territory.


Until the Mongols, the names of the Chinese dynasties were actually place names, different from the name of the ruling house. In fact, it's never been-- even when you have a new kind of name which are more ideological, a quality name, like the Yuan or the Ming or the Qing--it's never the name of the ruling house.

Ming = Zhu family. Han = Liu family. The names meant something though.

When the emperor is a baby, he can't rule. So he has a regent, just like the emrpess dowager in the late 19th century. All of the emperors, except Wu Zetian, who ended the Tan by creating the Zhou , were male.

The Empress Dowager (1860-1908) had a terrible historical reputation. But she was a reason why China is actually a country. The name of the dynasty also refers to the territory of the current empire.

No dynasty has come to power through an election. Every dynasty conquered or fought their way through military force. They maintain their power through bureaucracy and a regularized system of governance. A common school of thought, which in this case is the official education, examination system.

The field admin, provinces, prefectures, counties, are appointed by the central gov't, not the local.

Dynasties are thought of as cyclical-- with a beginning, a middle, and an end, and every period is an advance on the earlier period. The agricultural year is also cyclical. It is like a solar year, in that it's divided into 25 periods, each has 15 days. The lunar calendar has 12 moons or months, but you just have to add an extra month every seven years to sync the lunar calendar with the solar.

Sexagenary cycle: Stems-and-Branches (Chinese: 干支; pinyin: gānzhī), is a cycle of sixty terms used for recording days or years. One set of 12, one set of 10, so if you match them, you get a cycle of 60 before it repeats. The Jiazi cycle is very important in CHinese history. This is why the 60th birthday in China is the greatest celebration. You're supposed to have accomplished much of what you can accomplish by that time.

#### Section 2: Space

The Indian subcontinent crashed into the Tibetan Plateau, which created the Himalayas. Because the Tibetan plateau is higher, all rivers in China flow east. Rivers: Yellow, Yangtze, Fen, Huai.

Mountain ranges: North China Plain (largely because of drinage fom the west.) Sichuan Basin. Thse plains and plateaus are where population is centered. China proper is made up of nine macroregions. Regions have cores where rivers come together, and peripheries, which usually are up in the more mountainous zones.

North China is colder drier, South is wetter, warmer. North is dry land farming. South is wetland farming. North is wheat. South is rice.
