## 1.3: The Nature of Knowledge
- You can't force thoughts to not come to you but you can ask to let them come over you.
- Knowledge = state of the person/self: rocks/trees don't know anything
- Knowledge = state of achievement = something to be learned
- Plato: Believing something is not enough to know it
- Even if the belief is right, it doesn't mean that I know
- Jellybean number example
- True opinion = not enough, there must be some kind of basis or reason. It's not enough to believe and it's not enough to be certain.
- Components: Truth, belief, support/account?

### 4 characteristics of the self
- Cognitive: what you believe, what you know, information, memory
- "I remember..."
- Affective: emotions and moods: rough idea of how you feel
- Emotions = have to be about something. You can be regretful or hopeful about something (doesn't make sense if you are regretful, period)
- Moods = no need to be "about something:
- Experiencial: due to sensation of the external or internal environment
- Character traits: impatient, generous, empathetic, irascible...
- They can be dormant and just activated in a certan circumstance only

Ex: holding lemon
- C: I am holding a fruit
- A: I remember about the color of a dress of a woman I used to date
- E: The color of the skin is ...?

## 1.4: Socrates and the Unexamined Life
Five Dialogues (Plato)
  •	Socrates = 2x00 years ago, didn't work but asked about shit
  •	Justice, nature of what is right and what is wrong
  •	Apologia: "use of rationale"
  •	Socrates was believed to be corrupting the youth etc and was taken to court
  •	Juries = 501 jurors
  •	"Many people think that I put myself more knowledgeable than other people and I don't think that is true"
  •	Oracle at Delphi said "there is no one wiser than Socrates"
  •	Socrates didn't think that he knew the answers but he knew that he was ignorant.
  •	He says that "at least I don't have an illusion of knowledge whereas other people think they have knowledge when they are not"
  Second point
  •	Socrates wanted to spend his life asking questions to other people, get insights etc
  •	Socrates was put to death
  •	Socrates would rather die than not talk about what he feels is important
  •	"The unexamined life is not worth living"
  But is it, really?
  •	Consider the case of Mary, charity worker with no time for self-examination
  •	Under the literal sense her life is not worth living. This doesn't make much sense.
  •	Scholar at Chicago: "biotos" means "the unexamined life is not to be lived"...  we don't want to repeat this life
  •	Possibly she can go to another career after she finishes?
  •	S might be thinking of something else or something more modest: no self-examination = hole in your soul or you may be missing something here

## 1.5: The Big Asymmetry

  Self-knowledge and asymmetry
  •	There's a difference of self-knowledge between people
  •	Ruptured ankle = person who experienced that knows it
  •	You know yourself in a special way as opposed to everyone else
  •	Maybe you're not the best authority on lemon chemicals/calories/what have you, but as far as how it tastes to you, you are most probably the best authority
  •	Other people may have views but they have to ask you at some point and this is the asymmetrical difference at least for these components such as cognition/experiences
  •	Emotions/moods: Other people can know this
  •	Bob's knowledge of himself in terms of his emotions might not be as asymmetrical with others
  •	Characteristics: People are not good judges of their own characters hehe
  2.2: The Apology
  •	S: 469-399 BC
  •	Not interested in money, just wanted to learn shit
  •	He didn't teach anything
  •	Plato (P) believed stuff and he reported S's findings
  •	Trials in Athens: anyone who was there can become a juror
  Accusations
  •	He's messing with peoples minds
  •	He is distorting perspectives
  •	He is busy understanding nature vs trying to make a living
•	He teaches these things to other people (wat)
  •	S always says that he has not that much of knowledge
  2.3: The Defense
  •	Background: Priestesses in Delphi would inhale a gas from the underground and would then say stuff and people think that the info could not be wrong
  Points
  •	S says that "No one is wiser than S" just means that we can be tied with each other
  •	Maybe the Oracle says that S doesn't pretend that he has knowledge that he doesn't have, so maybe that is his advantage over other Athenians
  •	Wisdom: Knowing your limitations and saying that you don't know everything.
  •	S says that he spends a ton of time trying to disprove the notion that he is the wisest
  •	Politicians: they had views but none had knowledge (no one can justify their opinions)
  •	Poets: the poetry was wonderful but they are just saying the poems but not really
  •	Craftsmen: they were good at things but they don't know stuff about what they make
  •	This made Aristotle unpopular
  •	S's followers choose to follow him
  2.4: Socratic Method
  •	It's a form of teaching that ideally means that student is not given anything at all
  •	We draw outside of you things that you already have
  •	Basically the crux is that "why would I corrupt the youth deliberately if I knew that I would risk harming myself?
  •	S says that he doesn't know what happens when he dies and he is not afraid of what happens when he dies, no compromise for my principles.
  •	I don't think that I would live a life of value if I not speak. I am not willing to shut up because my life would not have any value to me.
  2.5: The Examined Life
  •	About Mary in Moldova again.
  •	Absurd to say that M's life is not worth living.
  •	Mary most probably is doing her job to prevent human beings from suffering because she cares about others' well-being and she might get to that POV after self-examination.
  •	Maybe something is missing without self-examination: Kraut's example
  •	Euthyphro: "I'm going to prosecute my dad for killing one of our slaves." S: "You must know the difference between right and wrong!" S then shows that E doesn't know about the difference between right and wrong.
  •	Crito: S's young friend. C tells S that he can save S escape and he wants S to escape because he will get embarassed if S doesn't escape. S: "You want me to go back on my principles to conform your status and prestige to what to do what is right? I'd rather die." C should not probably think about his standing to others.
  •	Ion: Rhapsode (job is to tell lines from Homer's poetry). I's head was filled with the thoughts of someone else. He is not able to develop his faculties.
  •	Oscar Wilde: Most people are other people.
  •	Much of what we think is incorporated from others. We are not able to think thoughts that are from our own selves.
  2.6: Summary
  •	The idea of self-examination is not so much as staring at yourself and introspection. S says that it is more effective to engage in conversation with others and find out what you think about yourself and others hehe.
  •	Because S is believing something after his death he thinks that S is not identical with his body. It is possible that S will survive and meet other souls somewhere.
  •	Important thing to discuss is nature of self: dualistic view of the soul
   
  3.2: Introduction and First Meditation
  Rene Descartes
  •	Mind is distinct from the body, free from prejudices, withdrawn from senses
  •	Senses are very misleading
  •	Empiricism: knowledge comes only from senses
  •	Everything has to be supported by the sense
  •	Rationalism: the use of reason to get info, we get knowledge from sensation too but it's only a source
  •	Many of the things that he thought when he was young, was not really that true when he grew up
  •	If we didn't have Copernicus + experiments, we would think that we live in a heliocentric solar system
  •	If we can be wrong about heliocentricity, then what else can we be wrong about?
  3.3: First Meditation Part 2 The Nature of Knowledge
  •	It is absurd to prove everything ever.
  •	If our senses lie to us, then we may be hard-pressed to believe ourselves
  •	I mean I am sure that I am holding this pen etc
  •	There are dreams which are really like real life
  •	He can't really be sure if he is dreaming or not but the primary elements of which dreams are built of have been experienced outside of the dream
  •	When painters wish to create forms they build out of forms they know already
  •	There are things that we say that are just characteristics that we make, can we really quantify an objective reality?
  •	We can probably be sure of things such as arithmetic and geometry, maybe physics and astronomy
  •	He then says that it is possible that there is a god
  •	Can he know that there is no god but god can deceive me of basically everything I know
  •	This would be contrary to god's goodness, though
  •	He can also suppose an evil genius that creates a ton of hoaxes lol
  •	Just think that we do not have a way of ruling out the possibility that all we are experiencing is fake a.k.a. "my brain was stolen by a grad student"
  •	Given that stuff, how can we know what we know????
  3.4: Second Meditation
  Questions in philosophy:
  •	What do you mean
  •	How do you know
  •	Am I so tied to the self that if I doubt them, I must doubt my own existence?
  •	If I persuaded myself then I must have existed :)
•	So not everything is in doubt, my existence is something that I am sure of. Because no matter how much I may be deceived, I know that there is a self that is being deceived and that he exists (because I think then I exist)
  •	I can't be sure if I have hands/whatever but I am sure that I am existing!
  3.5: What is the Self
  •	He can be sure that he exists but what is he?
  •	Up to now, he thinks of himself as a man, a rational animal.
  •	He is not so sure that he is necessarily bound up to his body because he can imagine himself existing without his body.
  •	He knows that at least he is a thinking thing, and that every person is a thinking thing
  •	This "thinking thing" line of thought is important: everyone can think, not just Descartes
  •	Other philosophers say that we should not put ourselves above the other animals which "do not think"
  •	Holding an orange: we can't be sure that we are really holding his (Zeke) but he can be sure that it seems that he is holding an orange.
  •	First-order belief = I am holding an orange
•	Second-order belief = I am having an experience of holding an orange (A belief about a belief)
  4.1: The Piece of Wax
  •	If there do exist objects in my mind, he can say what are they like
  •	Wax taken from a honeycomb still has a semblance of what it was. Everything is still present in it and it seems to be distinct as possible
  •	When you put the wax to the fire the wax changes in shape, smell etc, is it the same wax still?
  Wax
  •	The smell of the wax, the hardness, etc, must not have been the characteristics of the wax itself because the wax continued to persist in a melted state without those characteristics sticking around
  •	The wax may never have been the previous properties but it is a body that manifests itself in different ways
  •	Maybe it is some kind of mutable thing
  •	Called primary qualities: the quality essential to objects that do not depend upon any of our sensory perceptions to them
  •	Secondary = the stuff we perceive
  •	When I know about the wax, I know it not through imagnation, but I perceived through the mind and intellect
  •	My sensory experiences only contribute to what I know about the wax
  •	The world itself, independent of our minds, does not mind color, fragrance, etc except the objects described in purely mathematical terms
   
  4.2: The Third Meditation
  •	Very little that Descartes can sense :)
  •	So what is knowledge?
  •	There is a difference between distinct and confused perception
  •	We are confused to say that apples are red
  •	Knowledge about stuff comes from our intellect, not the physical properties of stuff
  •	He is theist
  •	"I have an idea of a god"
  •	I am not smart enough to know that and yet I have no basis of this idea
  •	The only way that I can find that explains this belief is that "god put this argument here"
  The Problem of Evil
  •	Problem: Lot of evil in the world: how can god have allowed evil to exist?
  •	D: Being error is a form of evil
  •	He says that if ignorance is a kind of evil, then when I'm wrong about something, I'm being evil (it seems like the more knowledgeable the more good you'll be able to do)
  •	If I do my absolute best, and I am in error, it is not due to me (I did everything), and god would not let me fail in reaching the conclusion that I want to do
  •	Whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive that the wax is yellow, then it is yellow
  •	General rule: Whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive is true
  4.3: 4th 5th and 6th Meditations
  •	You prove god's existence is that he is perfect and because existence is a part of perfection, then god exists. (ontological argument)
  •	It's like the logic proves itself
  •	Distinction: physical things are different from mental things
  •	If for any x and y, if x = y, then they have ALL the same characteristics
  Modal properties
  •	These are properties that things are capable of
  •	"Running a mile in 10 minutes": you can do this even if right now you are sitting a chair
  •	"I can conceive myself existing without a body (even a brain)": sort of true
  •	Hence, I have the modal property of existing without a body. My body does not have the property of existing without it. My body is not the same as my mind (they don't have the same properties).
  Dualism
  •	My mind is not the same as any thing in the universe.
  The Meditations
  Meditation I: Of the things which may be brought within the sphere of the doubtful
  •	He finds out that there were things that he thought were true that turned out to be false.
  •	He put this off until he was older.
  •	Now he is retired he can think.
  •	Everything he thinks is true he has learned from the sernse or through the senses but sometimes those sense are deceptive.
  •	There are things that it is not reasonable that we doubt them i.e. he is seated by the fire and as such if I doubt them then I would be mad.
  •	And yet because he is a man he has dreamt situations like this before and yet it is not real.
  •	But he says that sleep is not as clear and distinct as real life so he is definitely not sleeping.
  •	While sleeping, the things that are represented to us are like painted representations which could only have formed as the counterparts of somehting real and true
  •	Everything painted needs to have a basis at the start
  •	Arithmetic/geometry are different from physics/astronomy because they deal with the abstract and are true wherever you go
  •	An all-powerful God existed who has created him. How would he know that God is not deceiving him? God is good and as such it is impossible for God to deceive Descartes. It is contrary to his goodness to deceive.
  •	Even though there are atheists, there is nothing bad about taking the position of "God exists".
  •	Well if God is an evil genius and he is just fucking with me, then that sucks but I'm going to be "whatever".
  Meditation II: Of the Nature of the Human Mind
  •	If everything that he sees is false, and nothing really exists. WTF is true then?
  •	Is it not possible that I can think things for myself? Am I not something at least?
  •	Surely I exist because I persuaded myself of something right

  •	Cogito, ergo sum
  •	What did I formerly believe myself to be?
•	A reasonable animal, with bones/flesh etc, with actions (soul)
  •	Body = all that is defined by a certain figure: confined in a place, fills a given space, and can be perceived
  •	I can definitely think of stuff so I suppose I am a thing that thinks. Cogito ergo sum.
  •	We cannot say "I walk therefore I am" because walking can be doubted. Doubting is a form of thinking so even if we doubt cogito, we are still doing the act of thinking.
  •	Sum res cogitans: I am a thing that thinks
  •	When he says "thing" and "thinking" what does he mean? Is "thing" an amibuous throwaway, and does "think" mean "mind" or perception/sensation?

  •	Piece of wax
  •	Wax is not its characteristics but it isa body which has different perception forms?
  •	He says that it is a feebleness of the mind that it is prone to error when examining things, fo instance he aways assumes that things in hats and coats are people and not automatic machines
  •	Bodies exist not because of the sense but because you are able to understand them via imagination
  •	The mind is better than the body at thinking of things
  Meditation III: Of God: that He exists
  •	When considering God as an infinite, eternal, immutable, independent etc, his reality is more objective than formal. God is an infinite substance whereas he is only a finite substance.
  •	We cannot be aware of what we lack unless we are aware of a more perfect being that has those things which we lack.
  Clear and Distinct Perception
  •	Clear and distinct perception of God's existemce: Infinite objectivity and is more likely to be to. "It just is true".
  •	D argues, "What if the mediator is supremely perfect? Maybe D is potentially a god?" He rejects it, because
  •	God is all actual and not potential, and if D is constantly improving, then he will never attain that perception where there is no room for improvement.
  •	Potential being is not being at all, the idea of God must becaused by something with infinite actual being.
  •	D's circular reasoning: "Clear and distinct perception that God exists" <=> "God would not let such a clea and distinct perception be wrong"
  •	Reasoning behind clear and distinct perception is that "well, it's just true".
  •	Possible refuting: It doesn't follow that if I can define a concept then this concept exists  ("Philosophy grad student comic-book  reading checkers grandmaster")

  Possibility of deception?
  •	If the meditator could exist without God, he would have come to be out of  a being less perfect than God. There is no reason that he should continue to exist unless there is some force that preserves him, that creates him anew at every instant.
  •	Meditator states that his ideas must be innate and that he must have bee ncreated by God with this idea already in him.
  •	God must not have deceived him since all deception relies on some defect or the other, and a perfect God has no defects.
  Third Meditation  Part 2: Descartes' theory of ideas
  •	Every idea is a mere mode of thought: they are equal in their amount of formal  reality (reality intrinsic to themselves).
  •	What they represent, though, differs greatly, and so their objective reality: also differs greatly. Thus, the idea of God has more objective reality than the idea of a tree.
  •	No effect can have a greater amount of reality that its cause. Everything that comes into being must be made to be by something that has an equal or greater amount of reality.
  •	A stone can be made by chipping off a larger piece of rock, but a stone cannot be made out of a color since a stone is more real than a color.
  Fourth Meditation: God is No Deceiver
  •	God would not deceive him since to deceive is a sign of weakness or malice, and God's perfection would not allow it.
  •	If God created him, God is responsible for his judgment, and so his faculty of judgment must be infallible so long as he uses it correctly.
  •	If God has endowed him with infallible judgment, how is it that he can be mistake?
  •	He was created to only be a finite being. If he is wrong, it is not the result of some faulty faculty created by God, but a result of his (meditator)'s lack of perfection.
  •	If God is a perfect creator, God should be able to create perfect things. Why would he will it that the mediator can err?
  •	God's motives and reasons are incomprehensible to finite beings such as himself.
   
  5.1: Dualism
  •	D can be certain of things in his mind, as long as we are rigorous, careful enough to have clear and distinct perception.
  •	Mind = nonphysical. Not identical to ANY part of the body
  Isms
  •	Dualism answers: "What kind of things are there?"
  •	Monoism
  •	Materialism: One kind of thing, and that is material.
  •	Idealism: One kind of thing, and that is mind.
  Interactions between minds and bodies
  •	If you are a dualist, then how can the mental and the physical worlds interact? How can a nonphysical thing such as "I am thinking of.." result in a physical change "I am doing"
  •	Physical things can also cause mental things i.e. pin -> pain
  •	It sure seems that we can take a look into the minds of others. Are we really checking out their minds or are we seeing and infering them from body actions
  Gilbert Ryle
  •	The Concept of Mind
  •	These problems are symptoms of a mistake with the fundamental understanding of the mind
  •	Category mistake: "I have seen the students and the faculty and the buildings but not the university"... but he saw the things that make up the university.
  5.2: Modalities
  •	Descartes has a mistake in that he put the mind above the body -Ryle
  •	Dispositional property (modal): Even if salt is in a salt shaker, it is still soluble. Wood is flammable.
  •	People have a lot of dispositional properties.
  •	Ryle: If you think of what the concept of mindedness is, it is not about occupying a certain matter of substance, but it is being able to behave. Part of what it is to have a mind is to have a number of sophistications
•	Having a mind is nothing but a disposition to different behaviors (ex: aggressive, irascible, good chess player...)
  •	To find out if someone is smart, see what they can do in different circumstances. If they are empathetic, then they should act empathetic. It is absurd to say that they are empathetic if they don't act like that.
  •	A mind is just a huge disposition to behaviors.
  •	Descartes seems to think that it is possible to have a mind independent of behavior (i.e. it just exists). Ryle says this is a mistake because he thinks that there could exist a mind that is separate from the behaviors when it is not!
  •	Ryle wants to say that we should leave room for the phenomenon of "how to do something"
  5.3: The Category Mistake
  •	Ryle: The question of the "how" is more important than the question of the "why"
  •	Smart is as smart does (you are predisposed to be smart if you are smart)
•	To have a mind is not so much an on or off thing but a set of dispositions (higher chance to do this, that)
  •	The mind is not a matter of substance but it is a way of acting
  •	You can have a physical substance that can just say "oops..." constantly. Would that make it intelligent? Hard to say that it could.
  •	Both monoism and dualism are wrong in that they presuppose that a mind is either a physical (mono) or nonphysical (dual) substance.
  •	The mind is a set of dispositions to act towards a way.
  •	Basically, D is wrong because he wants to say that minds are things.
  5.4: Closing Ryles Criticism
  •	R wonders how D had made this category mistake. He thinks of these:
  •	D is not just espousing dualism but he is saying that we can create a new type of physics
  •	If we live in a physical world with physical laws, wtf happens to free will? Am I really making my own decisions?
  •	If we are machinations without free will then what are our senses of morality?
  •	Example: I hit you with my elbow unintentionally vs I hit you with my elbow intentionally
  •	D does not want to believe in a lack of free will -R
  6.1: Ryle on Emotion
  •	Review: Having a mind is a "degree" and not an on-off thing
  •	Being angry is being predisposed to do things that symbolize anger
  •	Being sad is being predisposed to do things that are sad
  •	Same with personality stuff:
  •	"The vain man does not feel he is vain"
  •	Vain people is not "I sure am vain..." it's being disposed to act self-promoting
  •	Being bored is to be predisposed to say "I am bored"
•	Sometimes, people know how they feel (feeling fear gives you a chill, etc)
  6.2: Privileged Access
  •	We have a privileged access to our own mind
  •	I am an authority on what my toe feels, and you on yours
  •	I am an authority on my opinions, and you on yours
  •	We have some knowledge on what happens on the minds of others, though they are not that good
  •	Descartes implies
  •	Phosphoresence: If something is going on in my mind, then I am aware of it. No matter what's in my mind, I am aware of it.
  •	Infallibility: If I think something is in my mnd, then it is. If I believe that liberals would win, then I am pretty sure that this is in my mind.
  •	Ryle says that both of those might be wrong
  •	Anti-phosphoresence: there must be some things in my mind that I am not thinking about XD
  •	Panic: If you're feeling genuine panic, is there a part of your mind to be self-aware of "hey I am panicking right now"? You are just full of terror, no room in the mind for self-awareness.
  •	In the same way, you're not thinking about being disgusted, you're just being disgusted.
  •	Anti-infalliblity: No special reason why I am infallible (especially in emotions). Vain people can deny their vanity but they are vain! Some people are sad but they don't know that they are sad. They are sad because they are disposed to behave in a sad way...
  •	Emotions = alleged infallibility
  6.3: Behaviorism
  •	Skinner/Watson says that in order to study our species we have to focus on extenal, observable behaviors ONLY. Minds are not proper subjects of investigation
  •	Ryle's behaviorism != Skinner's behaviorism
  •	Ryle: Minds are not subject to scientific investigation.
•	Ryle doubts that human behavior can be measured (like what Skinner tries)
  •	Ryle prefers to study the mind from the humanistic view (science won't work here)
  6.4: The Experiential
  Criticism of Ryle's Disposition Theory
  •	Lemons have a distinctive color. How can you characterize that in dispositional terms????
  •	Having an experience of yellow does not predispose you to say "This sure is yellow"
  •	Criticism on Ryle's theories is on this point. While he may make sense in terms of emotions, it doesn't seem logical here.
  6.5: Privileged Access II
  •	Descartes: I have privileged access to myself because I hang out with myself hence I learn about myself. I avoid buffets because I eat a lot there.
  •	The same goes with other people: over time you have privileged access to their minds if you have been with them for a long time
  •	Ryle: If you spend time with others, then over time you will gain their PA.
  •	Is this absurd? While elderly couples are aware of the emotions of their partner, they can't be more aware of the experiential states.
  •	We are infallible in the experiential part of the mind.
  The Concept of the Mind
  Descartes' Myth
  •	There is a problem now with the number of people who adhere to Descartes' view of the mind in that the mind and body are separate, and after the death, the mind will still function.
  •	Although human bodies are subject to the physical laws, minds are not in space. The workings of one mind are not witnessable by other observers; its career is private.
  Official Doctrine
  There is a doctrine about the nature and place of the mind which is prevalent among theorists, to which most philosophers, psychologists and religious teachers subscribe with minor reservations. Although they admit certain theoretical difficulties in it, they tend to assume that these can be overcome without serious modifications being made to the architecture of the theory.... [the doctrine states that] with the doubtful exceptions of the mentally-incompetent and infants-in-arms, every human being has both a body and a mind. ... The body and the mind are ordinarily harnessed together, but after the death of the body the mind may continue to exist and function."[5]
  Causal closure
  The stronger formulations of of causal closure assert that: "No physical event has a cause outside the physical domain." That is, the stronger formulations assert that for physical events, causes other than physical causes do not exist.
  Weaker forms of the theory state that "Every physical event has a physical cause. The weaker form of causal closure is synonymous with causal completeness,[5] the notion that "Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient physical cause."[4] That is, the weaker forms allow that in addition to physical causes, there may be other kinds of causes for physical events.
   
  7.2: Introduction: Freud
  •	Given by Freud in Vienna 1915-1916 and 1916-1917
  Epistemology
  •	For dramatic effect, Freud(F) says something along the lines of "Don't come back!" He argues that his theory is annoying (but more likely it is to raise interest).
  •	"In standard medical training, what you learn is via stethoscope. In psychoanalysis, it is through exchange of words."
  •	"Many people will say that this talk-based approach is f-in crazy", how can you treat them by words?
  •	By words, we're not thinking about streams of symbols, it represents people's beliefs and feelings. These include promises, commitments, insults, etc
  •	Words can be powerful. In the right timing and right words.
  •	Psychoanalysis has no basis and objective way of demonstrating it
  •	Try to do it by yourself! Observe the cases where you feel a certain way... "why did I do that? Why did I say that?" First-person verification. Try it by yourself.
  •	F doubts D's claim that the mind is infallible
  7.3: Sublimation and Freudian Slips
  Why would Freud think that there is a thing in your unconscious mind?
  •	"Civilization, to run, needs to take impulses that humans were born with so that we don't kill each other and engage in forms of violence."
  •	"Each of us is born with a tendency to: be violent, unbridled sexuality."
  •	"In the absence of civilization, each of us would be essentially rapists and be destructive."
•	(Thanks for the positivity, captain)
  •	Society wouldn't last that long if that was the case. Civilization serves as a cap or something.
  •	We compress or refactor these impulses.in a process known as sublimation.
  •	There are other behaviors in society that can make us release this sexual tension without sexually violating others (hehe). Same with violence (ex: sports).
Freudian slips (aka parapraxis)
  •	Different perspective now than 100 years ago, unconscious mind was new that time
  •	Small indications such at these slips may have big consequences...
  •	Minute stuff can serve us clues to important issues
  •	"If you think these slips of the tongue are completely random, then you're actually breaching the scientific worldview! Science views every event in the physical world is reducible to causes and it can't be completely random eh"
  •	Sometimes its true that when you're tired then you have more difficulty about remembering names.
  •	If someone actually says the opposite of what they say, it is unlikely that they are tired. There must be something going on.
  •	Someone saying "The proceedings is now closed" accidentally instead of "open" might be someone who unconscously wants the conference to not go on
  •	Someone saying "That hat is nice" but mispronouncing the word "nice" might acually mean that the hat is botched, hence a botching of the pronunciation, though they said it in a polite way.
  Inference to the best explanation
  •	If some hypothesis H explains the phenomenon P the best, then it might be true, as an evidence
  •	"It is not adequate hypothesis to say the proceedings is closed because he is tired."
  •	The best explanation is that "there are unconscious motives and desires behind this."
  •	Is there any evidence in our own lives for us doing such a Freudian slip?
  Summary
  •	We are endowed with urges by nature
  •	These urges are not something that are easy to control
  •	These slips have a sense of their own.
  •	We can study them and find out about ourselves
  7.4: Expression
  •	There are ways when we behave where we express the emotions that we feel.
  •	There is a reservoir of emotions underneath you that want to become satisfied
  •	Sometimes they come out when the speaker wanted to put them down before. This is the essential structure of a parapraxis.
  7.5: Freudian Epistemology
  •	Experts say that this is anecdotal experience and that Freud just gives cases that confirm his theory.
  •	Nowadays, we need more rigorous evidence. Anecdotes are unreliable (i.e. confirmation bias). 
  8.1: The Interpretation of Dreams
  •	Dreams were considered uring that time to be unscientific (they promoted mysticism).
  •	"People who challenge him who say that dreams are unscientific are actually challenging me and have an interest in proving me wrong" –Freud
  •	Is this really an argument? -.-'
  •	Dreams are usually vivid but aren't remembered. F argues that "we have to say that whatever the dreamer he dreamed about, is his dream."
  •	When you have "manifest content" (dream stories), you can interpret this "latent content" (desire the dream is about)
  •	Freud random interpretations of stuff in dreams: "3" = male genitalia, "vessel" = female genitalia
  8.2: On Sleep
  The main point of sleep is rehabilitation of the body
  •	"The state in which I was dreamlessly sleeping = fetus state" (fun fact: fetuses dream)
  •	"1/3 of us is like unborn"
  •	What are dreams for?
  •	To protect the body's rehabilitation process while sleeping
  •	A response to the body that might disrupt the sleep
  •	Alarm clock becomes ringing of church bells
  •	Dreaming of teeth when someone was having his tooth extracted
  •	Dreams are a way of smoothing things out
  •	Dream work: Opposite of dream interpretation, we interpret this manifest content and we get to the lower level, aka latent content
  •	*Dream interpretation takes manifest content
  What a dream says
  •	Let's not overinterpret things
  •	We want to know if it speaks clearly, what and for what purpose this material is there for
  •	It doesn't mean that when there is manifest content that there is something there, it couldbe just because your body doesn't want your dreams to be messed up
   
  8.3: Dreams and Desires
  •	We fulfill our desires in dreams by making them super powerful
  •	Women's primary ambitions are to success in love -Freud (Freud was a sexist.)
  •	Each of us has some desires/ambitions and daydreams are models for where our ambitions are realized
  •	Daydreams (by acting on our desires) are a way of making our waking life not too distracted.
  •	A way of making something satisfied is imagining that it is satisfied
  •	A daydream may be a response to distractions at the office/what have you
  •	Daydreams = of things we are consciously aware off, dreams = of things we are NOT constantly aware off
  8.4: Premises and Techniques of Dream Interpretation
  •	The dreamer does know what his dreams mean, only that he doesn't know what he knows.
  •	"Everything that happens mentally has a prior, sufficient condition, it was determined by forces that existed in the self" -F
  •	No matter what you say about your dream, there is some part there that is true
  •	It might be that the calculations used in computing a check were self-deterministic (aka predictable), but that doesn't mean that he can't make a mistake (he can!).
  •	It doesnt meant that you do a process means that you are correct (people can be mistaken about what a dream means).
  Freud's Unconscious
  •	Some things are unconscious if they can be accessed by introspection but aren't reachable right now. Such as dreams.
  •	Urges of a violent/sexual nature are unconscious as well
  •	Semantics
  •	Subconscious: closed to introspection part of the mind
  •	Preconscious: open to introspection part of the mind
  •	Unconscious: contains both of those things
  •	For example, men might have urges to have sex with their sister but they are hidden from day to day life
  Resistance
  •	The dreamer who has these unconscious urges will protect them because these urges are scary
  •	When anybody is resisting, that's a way of how the creaky machine is creaking (Freudian epistemology)
  •	If a child does not want to open his clenched fist, he is hiding something. Just like when we say "our dream of being a murderer doesnt have meaning" means you are hiding what you think.
  8.5: Examples
  •	"A lady reported that when she was a child that she frequently dreamt that God wore a paper-cut hat on his head. What can you make out of it?"
  •	*She used to have a hat of that sort which she wore when she was eating. She looked at her brother/sister when eating to see if they had more food on their plates.
  •	F: Even if God is wearing a paper-cut hat, he can still see everything anyway. Woman said that she was actually able to see the plates around her when she was a child.
  •	Manifest c: God wearing a hat
  •	Latent c: "They can do that to me but I can still see what I want to see"

  •	"A skeptical woman patient had dream where some people told her about a book that I wrote about jokes. (Freud's book was praised highly). Then something with a channel..."
  •	*On a steamer going across the English Channel, this man was joking that they were going from the sublime (France) to the ridiculous (England).
  •	F: The book by F was ridiculous. Disdain for the dream
  •	Manifest c: Book with jokes + channel
  •	Latent c: Absurd about having a book about jokes

  •	"A patient dreamt that several members of the family were sitting around a table with a peculiar shape. There was a peculiar relationship between the man and his father.
  •	Latent c: Something strange about his own family

  Distortion
  •	There is a lot of plasticity in the underlying mateial that turns into a manifest content
  •	MC = portrayal of LC
  •	Without dreaming, this latent stuff would just bubble up, but dreams give us a compromise that allows us to release stuff without being an ass
  •	Ex: Dreaming of playing the piano = masturbation (wat)
   
  9.2: Introduction
  •	Timothy Wilson's "Strangers to Ourselves"
  •	We want to check where Freud's theory left off.
  How exactly..
  •	Does Freud prove that "3 = male genitalia" and "vessel = female genitalia"?
  •	He just says that "well it worked for me".
  •	If we come up with different answers to that question, what opinion works?
  •	Maybe F is right, but the evidence F gives for that claim is interesting, but not really persuasive.
  •	If there is truth there, we would like to know what that is.
  9.3: Two Parts of the Unconscious
  •	Way of dealing with things in philo+psych: We want better support experimentally, and theoretically.
  Points
  •	The parts of the unconscious that interest T.W. and his colleagues are those that are not verifiable through introspection.
  •	We can have this unconscious awareness of facts (such as having a memory rejogged).
  •	Preconscious, once again, is the part of the mind that can be brought up. This could be something trivial such as your 5th grade teacher, or something deeper such as a lack of self-confidence.
  •	T.W.'s research deals with the subconscious (parts of the mental state which cannot be brought up).
  •	The distinction between preconscious and subconscious is very important!
  9.4: The Freudian Legacy
  •	T.W. wants to extend F's legacy and puts the evidence right in front of you. He won't accuse you like F. (hehe)
  •	"One thing seductive about the F legacy is that it explains so much." (this can be sarcastic lol)
  •	T.W. posits that there are parts of the unconscious are correct.
   
  9.5: The Unconscious as Adaptation
  "The unconscious, particularly the subconscious is an [evolutionary] adaptation".
  •	[Adaptations usually have a function behind them]
  •	There are many aspects of intelligent behavior that are worth outsourcing to the subconscious behavior.
  •	You may be thinking of other stuff right now, but just subconsciously. This is good, evolutionarily speaking, because we get to focus on more important things (ex: manhiditis). This is very, very, significant for us.
  •	We can be unconscious of something but still be intelligent about it.
  9.6: Examples of Outsourcing
  •	Nearly every day, you are able to interpret someone else's face. Most of us are able to determine the emotional significance of a face, and adjust accordingly.
  •	We are incredibly powerful interpreters of language. Dimensions:
  •	Words and how they are put together: morphology.
  •	Sentences and their grammatical construction: syntax.
  •	How to create meaning: semantics
  •	Given a meaning, getting what it says: pragmatics.
  •	When we are confronted with a sentence, we understand the sentence almost effortlessly, generally speaking.
  •	Non-human animals have communication systems, although there is NOTHING like our (human's) language.
  •	Oftentimes we have something behind the literal meaning of things. "Oh, we haven't seen Fred much. He has a new girlfriend in Chicago." This implies that he is with his girlfriend.
  •	Individuals with autism have difficulty understanding the meaning of faces, and the pragmatic meaning of words.
  •	Not everyone has a strong outsourcing mechanism.
  9.7: The Snowball and the Iceberg
  In philo, we want healthy skepticism
  •	Even if T.W. says established things, check out different things!
  •	"Some people say that consciousness is an iceberg. Consciousness is really a snowball on the tip of the iceberg itself." -T.W.
•	We get information at a very very high number signals per second. (10M eye receptors)
  •	We can be aware of 40 things at a time.
  •	Fallacy of equivocation: Changing from one meaning of a word to the other
  •	T.W. changes the meaning of "information" midway through his reasoning.
  9.8: Jane Eyre and the Spin Doctors
  Two Dimensions of the Unconscious
  •	To gather information about the world (face, words, detecting danger).
  •	To maintain your well-being. We need to believe that things are going to work out for the best and we need this "spin doctor" that tells us at an unconscious level that things are good.
  •	When we get attacked verbally, we try to justify things using an antidote of justification (sour grapes?). This isn't necessarily a bad thing!
  •	"Jane Eyre Miss Reed" effect: People often believe things until they die because to believe anything else brings misery to them. We always try to justify ourselves. T.W. says that this is not irrational but that we do this to prove that the glass is half-full.
  9.9: One of the Major Battlegrounds of the Self
  •	Without the spin doctor, we might be drowned in facts and are depressed because of this. This can lead to people becoming depressed.
  •	Some also have too much of the spin doctor and are naive about their own abilities.
  •	The key is to find the balance between the "spin doctor" and the "truth detector".
  "The conflict between the need to be accurate and the desire to feel good about ourselves is one of the major battlegrounds of the self, and how this battle is fought and how it is won are central determinants of who we are and how we feel about ourselves." —Timothy Wilson
  •	Each of us has to confront ourselves wrt this dilemma. Part of life is how we attack this balance.
   
  9.10: Automaticity and the Will
  Intention-in-action
  •	You're engaged in something and its something your're doing intentionally but its not the result of a prior intention.
  •	Some automatic behaviors start as conscious and they become automatic. (Ex: piano playing, soldier training).
  •	When playing the piano, you can let yourself go to do things automatically.
  •	Automaticities are still intelligent, but are just automatic
  Negative Effects
  •	Our automatic behaviors are not alway healthy: we can have an automatic response such as being afraid of dogs when we don't need to do so
  •	Phobias are not rational and can be a problem for people.
  •	Our automatic unconscious behaviors have a lot of inertia, like an elephant does. When we want to redirect it, we would have a hard time.
   
  10.2: Your Personality
  •	Personality: The psychological processes that determine a person's characteristic, behavior, and thought. -Alport
  •	Characteristic means: This is what you are. Ex: A characteristic tiger has four legs (although there are tigers with three legs). If you are altruistic, then you are. You may pretend that you're not, but you are.
  •	Personality theory has supplanted both psychoanalysis and behaviorism
  "The trait approach" fundamental blocks
  •	State of extrovertedness
  •	Emotional stability
  •	Agreeableness
  •	Conscientiousness
  •	Openness to experience
  •	These are all traits which are reportable by people
  We will understand the way people act when we know how they view the world
  •	Is this conscious or unconscious?
  •	T.W.: Peoples construal of themselves are not like their subconscious selves are.
  •	How people respond to questionnaires may not scale to how people believe in the real world.
  •	We never know for sure who ourselves our. That's why we ask others who we are.
  •	The correspondence between people's ratings of their own personality and other's ratings of their own personality are not high.
  •	People agree among themselves about what a person is like rather than with the person itself.
  •	People think that they are more charitable than they really are.
  •	Aristotle: "Character and the cultivation of character is what it means to be mature."
  •	It turns out that character traits are less predictable of what we do, it is more of "circumstances of the moment"
   
  10.5: Emotions: Conscious or Unconscious
  •	Emotions have been thought to have a conflict with reason.
  •	Emotions have been suggested recently to have a connection with rationality.
  •	Emotions are some ways universal and some ways cultural.
  •	Universal: Disgust is universal, wherever we go. We share that with members of our species.
  •	Cultural: The emotion that the Japanese define as "bliss lost in a crowd" is not something that people in Texas where they have wide spaces may experience.
  •	Emotions are very much modal properties. "I can be angry if I..."
  •	People might just be disposed to smile vs smiling at you
  10.6: Conscious or Unconscious Emotions
  •	Emotions involve some kind of content, and involve some cognitive part of the mind
  •	They can be a construal of the world. Being angry = viewing the world in a certain type of way. Being afraid = another view.
  •	Emotions are conscious.
  •	T.W.: "Some of our emotions are subconscious and are not something we can introspect upon".
  •	Emotions have certain "feelings to it". There's a feeling behind disgust, anger, etc.
  •	Some aspects of emotions don't have to be conscious. For example, I can perceive someone to be irritated subconsciously. People can be irritated subconsciously.
  •	Question: how can I find out when I have these unconscious emotions and how can I prevent them?
  •	What happens if I am happy at the conscious level but not at the subconscious level? If the two things are out of sync, what can I do?
  Low Road vs High Road: Two Systems
  •	Low Road: without a strong stimulus, I have a strong reaction to a stick
  •	High Road: being able to think about the stick and not running when you figure it out.
  •	Two emotional systems: one automatic, one "check the facts"
  •	The low road stuff is powerful when thinking it through is not beneficial for us. Things to keep ourselves alive.
  •	Emotions do not come in a single form, rather, they take a variety of forms: some are conscious, some are not. Better to moderate our emotions wrt this.
   
  10.7: Conscious Prejudice
  •	Unconscious emotions can be problematic in that they're difficult to change.
  •	Even if you convince yourselves that spiders are good, etc, your cognitive stuff will still leave your unconscious fears intact.
  •	Two affective systems: conscious and unconscious.
  •	People can sincerely be non-prejudiced, but they can have prejudices that they are unaware of. They can even deny this but they still exist.
  •	Real estate agents make differences of racial categories, teachers call males or females disproportionately.
  •	The agents can claim that they are not prejudiced, its just that their behavior is bigoted and racist.
  •	How do we go about changing this subconscious racism?
  •	Unconscious priming of a race changes your behaviors.
  •	We have to think of changing this subconsciously.
  10.8: Affective Forecasting
  •	To what degree do I know of emotions I would make and I would feel in the future?
  •	Winning the lottery isn't as super happy as it was. They were happy for a short time and after that, they lost the money and became sadder than before.
  •	Our affective forecast would not make us happy.
  •	This happens also for negative things–we would be devastated for a loss but we overestimate this. We are more resilient that we predict ourselves to be.
  •	The adaptive unconscious keeps us looking on the bright side whenever possible. We get to appreciate each day, instead of conscously thinking about the negative side.
  Flow
  •	As long as we have a project that is challenging but not too challenging, we enjoy. It's not about the end result but its the thrill of the chase.
  A large source of happiness is not about "having things" or "having credentials", rather its the process of getting there.
   
  10.9: Paradox of Psychotherapy
  •	Psychot fell apart because it didn't want its core beliefs under scientific scrutiny.
  •	Psychot is still there, but it is about as effective as an Inuit talking to shaman.
  •	So much of self-understanding is about telling yourself a coherent story about your life.
  •	If you're able to explain yourself why you feel depressed or why you are anxious, then you are able to become more happy.
  •	Psychotherapy is effective in that people can talk to someone else.
  •	T.W.: One good way of understanding yourself is asking yourself (in a third person POV) how you feel or by looking at yourself.
  •	Back to Ryle's "I know about myself because I tend to hang out with myself more often".
  •	Ryle: we can know stuff about ourselves by watching ourselves in the third person too.
  •	While T.W. does not deny that we can learn things by introspection (such as feeling pain), we should look at ourselves from the third person.
  10.10: Do Good, Be Good
  •	There is a large and unappreciated dimension of our cognitive lives (subconscious) and that we can't really imagine it.
  •	How can you change your subconscious stuff? We can't do this by changing your mind at the conscious level.
  •	T.W.: By modifying your behavior you change change your bias. Ex: teacher should have a counter for how many times he calls his students. Realtor should have a checkbox etc.
  •	"By changing my behavior, I can change aspects of my mind."
   
  11.2: Two Kinds of Rationality
  Theoretical vs Practical Rationality
  •	Theoretical: The rules by which we try to ascertain the truth. Example: logic. We use it to infer information. What's the best way to believe?
  •	Practical: That set of norms by which we make decisions and perform actions that make sense. Practical rationality: Should I bring my umbrella to day? Should I have children? What career path should I take?
  •	When people make decisions it is more of what to do, rather than what to think.
  Damasio: To what extent is practical rationality something that can be purely understood in a cognitive way? Can we give a practical account of human rationality when it is working well, without emotions?
  •	His answer: No, we cannot reason in a practical rational way, unless you have emotions that help guide your behavior.
  11.3: Unpleasantness in Vermont
  •	Phineas Gage: Guy with the thing that hit his head.
  •	Although he was still alive, his personality changed.
  •	He can speak perfectly well but there was something about his affect that has gone awry. He was now douchy to others and bad mouthed others.
  •	Gage was still rational but he had lost his basic social intelligence and cognition for the feelings of others.
  •	Recap: T.W. said that brain components was modular: they were independent from each other and they took care of separate, independent things. Maybe Gage's social part was shot?
  •	Gage was not able to second-order his emotions.
  •	Gage's ventro-medial pre-frontal region was the part that was damaged.
   
  11.4: Two Kinds of Freedom
  •	Modern-day Gage: "Elliot"
  WTF is free will?
  •	Do people act of their free will when they are stressed out, or when a gun is pointed to them, or when they are addicted to a drug?
  •	Philosophers have two notions:
  •	Freeom of action. Scratching your ear is a free action (i.e. because of free will). I did it but I could have not done otherwise if I wanted to.
  •	Freedom of will. Having the will that I wished to have. Whether or not I can make decisions that can modify the "will that I have". The will is that system of dispositions, desires, proclivities, and inclinations that are affective in getting me to act in way one way or another (ex: will to like this type of cookies, will to do exercise).
  •	To what extent can we modify the will that we have?
  •	Can I make differences to the will that I have/my tendencies? T.W. said that your prejudices can be partially subverted by conscious stuff.
  •	If we can change our will, then we can say that we have "freedom of will".
  •	Humans can sort of change their will/tendencies.
  •	Non-human animals (and to an extent, children) don't seem to be capable of exercising "freedom of will".
  •	Changing your will requires this second-order way of viewing yourself and your tendencies.
  •	If you don't modify your own will, at old age you may never have the ability to modify your own will.
  As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport. .
  - William Shakespeare
  •	Damasio's patient seems to have a lack of this freedom of will (second sense).
   
  11.4: A Modern Phineas
  Elliot
  •	Elliot has been denied SSS benefits, on some level it seems that he is capable of living a life, but he is compromised, some way.
  •	Elliot had been living in a perfectly normal life and then it turned out that he had a tumor in an area not that far from Gage's critical area.
  •	Elliot found it hard to make decisions about things. He can't even sort papers because he thought a ton of how the papers were to be sorted.
  •	He had been irrational to the larger frame (doing the task itself) by being super rational to the smaller frame (this minor detail in the task).
  •	He can concentrate but he is irrational in terms of practical rationality.
  •	Elliot can pass through several tests, above average intellect. But, he can't decide things properly. He literally cannot make decisions.
  Comparison with Gage
  •	D: In both cases, their free will (second def) was compromised.
  •	They cannot be the persons who can make changes to themselves.
  •	E was surprisingly not emotional. E can watch news but the world doesn't affect him. E was not cognizant of his emotions for this thing.
  •	D has a hypothesis that these missing pieces in both E and G were affecting them. The connection was crucial for living normal productive lives.
   
  12.2: Deeper Into Rationality
  •	What roles do emotion play in practical rationality.
  •	Theoretical rationality: can we find what the truth is?
  •	Practical rationality: what is my best interest?
  •	Oftentimes we have dilemmas on thing that happen.
  Act-state-outcome theory of decision making
  •	Act: Surveying "Should I... or should I not?"
  •	State: Different states that the world would be possible to be in, relative to the acts that I have done.
  •	Outcome: Whatever happens hehe.
  •	Usually we rank the choices that we make. Example is taking a beach vacation:

  •	How likely are the different states of the world? Depending on the probabilities of things, we have different numbers and decisions on what's going to happen.
  •	However we try to rationalize things, there is a certain amount of subjectivity there.
  •	Under normal circumstances, we want to maximize subjective expected utility.
  •	"Following your gut" may be a perfectly good way of maximizing subjective expected utility. We maximize things but we don't CALCULATE it neccessarily.
  •	Damasio has an error in that he says that we calculate everything (he is just thinking about theoretical rationality).
   
  12.3: Strange Bedfellows
  •	Gage + Elliot = D makes his hypothesis that there are parts of the brain that may get knocked out and have modular functions from each other.
  •	Damage to prefrontal cortex usually breaks your ability to be practically rational.
  •	Patients with bilateral damage on the amygdala result in a loss of decision making and abnormalities in social behavior.
  •	When you have rough memories (dispositional accounts), you are more likely to conjure an image about that memory.
  •	These memories are preconscious and not subconscious. We can call up these images but its not like its there all the time. There is a disposition to activate these, though.
  •	Stimuli can activate in your memory the disposition to things.
  Nature of Emotions
  •	Emotions get us to behave in ways that seem unproductive (locally at least). We give money to people that we will never see again.
  •	Does altruism make sense? There are cases of "altruism" in animals but this is accounted for by evolutionary biologists as kin selection. (I take reasonably special care for people who share our genetic material).
  •	Does this apply to humans? We do help out perfect strangers, after all. Our emotions suit us to behave in an altruistic way, and that gives us in a way a sort of rationality. By helping others that are not our kin, we are part of a larger community that is more likely to survive.
  •	A group with compassion for its manners is more likely to survive. Does this mean that love, generosity, kindness, etc nothing else but the result of evolution? Does this negate the possibility of true free will and true altruism? D says no. When you help someone, your motive may be that you just want to be better off in life, makign your altruism sincere. Although you have a disposition to be compassionate evolutionary, that doesn't take anything away from you when you do something altruistic.
  •	Altruism can be genuine, even if altruism is what members of our species practice to make our species survive.
   
  12.4: Two Kinds of Emotions
  Primary and Secondary Emotions
  •	Primary/basic emotions are thought to be universal because they are reactions and states that our species experience. Anger, sadness, happiness, fear, surprise, disgust.
  •	Just by being born into our species, under certain conditions you will experience these things.
  •	Gage/Elliot are capable of the basic emotions.
  •	Secondary emotions are dependent upon a certain evaluation and depend on your life history. Example is Japanese ame, which depends upon certain views of your culture.
  •	Dependent on belief system, experiences
  •	In some societies, we are allowed to be angry here... in some societies, we are supposed to be polite.. etc.
  We are the same because we share the same primary emotions. We are different because we have different life experiences.
  12.5: Two Kinds of Smiles
  Duchenne smiles
  •	Duchenne was famous to Darwin because he was able to manipulate the nerves to produce specific facial expressions.
  •	Smiles  that involve the eye aren't fakable smiles and are genuine manifestations of player.
  Polite Smiles
  •	Not produced by a sufficiently powerful stimulus. "Smiling with their mouths only."
  •	Not necessarily deceptive, but not exactly powerful.
  Distinction
  •	Primary emotion happiness might produce your Duchenne smile. Secondary emotion happiness doesn't really mean that you're super pleasured and happy, hence a polite smile.
  12.6: Emotions and their Variations
  Feelings are our perceptions of our own bodily responses that occur when we have emotions running in us.
  Damasio
  •	Each of the primary emotions have a mechanical way of manifesting themselves to you. Fear means a tightening of the gut. Sadness: slower heart rate. Anger produces a different physiological response.
  •	When I am aware of what happens to me, I have a feeling.
  •	Feelings (btw emotions are feelings) can fall into general categories but there could be variations in the general categories themselves. Euphoria/ecstasy are variations of happiness. Melancholy/wistfullness are variations of sadness. Panic/shyness are variations of fear. Panic is an extreme version of fear while shyness is a more institutional and "I am locked in" type of fear. When fear becomes long term, fear becomes shyness.
  •	Dispositions: things that will not always perfectly. Someone with chronic shyness has a disposition to fear in social situations and they have to do something to turn it around.
  •	Unlike Ryle, D says that dispositions can have a physiological basis and will prove it with facts.
  12.7: The Somatic Marker Hypothesis
  •	Contrast with clear and distinct perception :)
  •	Damasio says that this c&d p doesn't allow for gut feelings (if I have a gut feeling about "this is a sharp knife" then that is not c&d p).
  •	D says that Decartes deals in theoretical rationality while D deals in practical rationality.
  The Hypo
  •	Imagine yourself owning a large business. You have this potential business partner who is very good business-wise but is the arch-enemy of your best friend. Do you proceed with the deal or not? A rational adult creates scenarios of what are the possible things that would happen. You tell yourself that you might not want to be seen dining in a cafe with this business partner when your friend sees you.
  •	D says that it is perfectly okay to follow your gut feeling here.
  •	For D, gut feeling is another term for somatic marker. This image that you envision in your head about your friend is somatically marked in the sense in that its not just something you cognize and you are aware, but is an image that is replete with feeling and has an affective tone. Your perception of a possible state of affairs is going to be coloured with the way your gut or any part of your body reacts to that scenario.
  •	Normal, prudent people can make decisions using their gut when you are in a position of moral ambiguity.
  •	Damasio suggests that the deliberate (cdp) decision making process isn't compatible with the decision making process that makes somatic markers.
  •	Formal logic was never designed to answer what to do, but it says what is true.
  •	Subjective expected utility theory can allow you to use your gut feelings.

   
  12.8: The Somatic Marker Dysfunction
  •	D says that the problem with E/G is that some modules work fine but his somatic markers are broken as it were. He's not able to check the outcomes of his choices. He acts but he has no way of evaluating his outcomes. He just rationalizes things all day long.
  •	At the individual level, the failure of the SM causes someone to have a problem in how they navigate their life. Breakdown in SM can cause sociopaths and psychopaths. The SMs of sociopaths are broken and they don't have the empathy for others. "Sick culture" means that everyone has a weaker SM. This has happened before in Nazi Germany, Cambodia Pol Pot, Jim Crow period in US history. People in the American South lost their feelings for people of a different race.
  •	Could it be that a sufficient way of education and brainwashing and propaganda can erase the SMs of people? The propaganda of Nazis was "we have to stop feeling anything for these Jewish/handicapped/communist people". It made it easier for Nazis to hate Jews.
  12.9: Testing the Hypothesis
  •	Galvanic skin response: Measuring their response to electricity to check their affectiveness.
  •	Experiment: show a bunch of slides, some with disturbing images, to people and measure their affectiveness. People with damaged frontal lobes didn't feel that much for the disturbing images (versus normal people, who reacted). Although Elliot knows that it is a bad thing to see, he's not going to feel (physiologically) that it is a bad thing.
  •	Experiment: four decks of cards with different sets of gains and losses. Decks A and B = high gains and high losses. Decks C and D = low gains and low losses. People, when run through this experiment, have a tendency after a period of time to choose C and D because of their gut feeling. Elliot/damaged people don't change strategies.
  12.10: Did Descartes Err
  •	Abyssal separation between body and mind
  •	Damasio wants to criticize Descartes' dualism and that he says that there is no sense that can be made with the mind without interacting with the body.
  •	If you're a disembodied spirit like an angel, you won't be able to appeal to how your gut feels. You can't use your physical tools such as the SMs to make decisions.
  •	For Descartes, he is not only separable from his body but he is also a nonphysical substance. D would say that you can't make decisions without the SM. We have to be able to follow your gut feelings.
  •	The problem is not just the dualism but its the need for the gut feeling aka your body to get by in the world.
  13.2—Spin and Tipperary
  •	Back to Ryle: You can whistle a happy tune (tipperary) to mask something underneath.
  •	Very self-deceptionish, if I whistle a happy tune, then I might convince myself that I am happy.
  •	Back to Wilson: Our internal spin doctors. This can lead to an inflation of yourself. Sometimes being "not honest" will pump you up and put you in better social situations. A certain amount of positive spin actually affects you in a positive way.
  •	Back to Damasio: Because of the diff between practical and theoretical rationality, this positive spin helps us to have a more practical approach on things.
  13.3—Pascal's Wager
  •	Pascal: Probability theory, inventory of syringe
  In the absence of strong evidence of the existence of God, is it not more rational to believe that He exists? A decision matrix would lead to the outcome that... (you know this already)... gambling on the fact that God may exist
  •	It seems that it is prudentially rational to believe this but we can't just make people believe things if the evidence to the contrary.
  •	You can't directly believe in a GCB (greatest common being) but you can cultivate your faith by surrounding yourself with people who believe in the same belief.
  •	People like to believe things, despite evidence to the contrary ("I believe that my husband does not mingle with women", "I believe that I am not an alcoholic").
  •	Can we sort out in a principled way if this is irrational or rational behavior?
13.4—The Puzzle (Mele)
  •	Other deception: telling someone else that it's going to rain when it's not.
  •	How does deceiving yourself work? It looks like we are believing two things at the same time.
  •	Straight self-deception vs twisted self-deception
  •	S: People believe something that they want to be true. Just because you want something to be true and that you believe it, doesn't mean you have deceived yourself. Maybe you believe something because there is evidence on its behalf?
  •	T: People are twisted into believing something that they want to be false. A jealous husband may want to believe that his wife is having an affair when she is not or he has no evidence and despite his desire for this to not be true.
  •	How can you make yourself believe something? You can't just say "I believe" and believe things.
  •	Confirmation bias
  •	Most (more than 50% of) people think that they are better than others at stuff.
  •	Being wrong about something doesn't mean that you are deceiving yourself. Self-deception means that you have this motivated irrationality or coming to believe something in spite of evidence to the contrary.
  •	Our desiring something to be true or false exerts a biasing effect on what we want to believe. Consider: women who didn't want to believe the coffee breast cancer thing. They may not be aware that they are affecting their judgment of the matter. Suppressing evidence is usually something that they are not aware off.
  14.2—Two Models of Self-Deception
  The idea of self-deception is a product of evolution, and it has a home in the deception of others (!).
  •	The self-deceiver has different levels or segments or partitions in her mind, each with their own beliefs about the case.
  •	On one level, you want to please your parents, on another level, you want to do what you want with your life.
  •	Another type of self-deceived person may be due to the manipulation of the information that supports what they believe while doing the opposite for things that they don't believe.
  •	Spin doctor: psychological health has some basis in self-deception. When do we know, though, whether we are doing it for our own good or whether we are doing it to deceive ourselves?
  •	When people avoid unpleasant truths in their lives, it is often impossible is self-deception or something is at work without knowing their motives. There is a lot of grey in the middle of the different self-deceptions.
  14.3—Deceiving Others
  •	We should understand self-deception from the concepts of deceiving others, or to make us socially successful.
  •	Deceiving others is hard work. When you get caught, you will lose reputation, etc.
  •	Researchers have found that people in online dating can't raise their score by a lot because it will seem exaggerated, causing a hit in reputation, but they with often raise their "score" by a little bit. People always rachet theirselves a few notes upward.
  •	Four categories of cues to detect deception in others:
  •	Nervousness: they are fidgety because they consider the causes. Imperfect because people may be nervous because of other things.
  •	Suppression: in trying to control their nervousness, they engage in muscle control, example: change in voice pitch "I didn't steal the cake"
  •	Cognitive load: having have a lot of information in mind. Harder for them to keep numbers in mind etc. Can be detected by simpler sentences.
  •	Idiosyncratic sources: When someone is telling a lie, they give explanations or reasons that are irrelevant or off-the-wall.
  •	People have an easier way of detecting if someone is lying if they know the person itself because they already have this baseline of how they act.
  •	Most studies of deception apply to people who don't know each other so they're not that accurate. They also don't allow you to question your deceiver, which is not like real life.
  •	Suppose you want others to believe your deception; if you fool yourself into believing it, then you won't display the physiological description of deception. You get to have an appearance of honesty (and in fact, you will be honest).
  •	Another reason for self-deception is that retribution for being wrong would be less than for being deceitful. Liars are treated worse than people who are mistaken. Deceive yourself first if you want to deceive others.
  14.4—Deception in Service of Social Advancement
  •	People like to think that if they lie, they will advance in society.
  •	People like confidence and confidence sometimes comes with deception (saying that you are confident when you are not). The benefits of self-deception serve our social ends. If you get to believe that you are great, other people will follow you (as long as you do that in a non-mean-spirited way.
      •	Research 2008 by Wittchurch: Three photos of one person: one by himself, one morphed with a handsome, one morphed with an ugly. Participants were more likely to choose the morphed version of them (handsome) than the picture that they normally look like. If the photo was of that of a close friend, they will still choose the more attractive photo. To people you don't know, it's neutral. They were likely to make a decision faster if they were morphed attractively, then normal, then morphed unattractively.
      You see the version of yourself that you want to see.
      •	The attractive photo is somatically marked in a positive way. At a gut level, we feel that these things that are attractive are us.
      •	So why do we fudge the data without having an explicit knowledge that we are fudging the data?
      •	We might see data as "supporting what you believe" and we somatically mark it as okay. We might see data as "contradicting what you believe" and we somatically mark it as unpleasant.
      •	Example: believing "God made my friend live" may be because of a predisposition to believe such a thing.
       
      14.5—What I Don't Know Can't Hurt Me
      •	There was a student that wanted to withdraw from the class because the student didn't want to learn because learning more may cause them to change their mind and their belief system. You'd think that people would want to be informed.
      •	Experiment: People with different attitudes on capital punishment were provided with different sources of information. Some info said that cp was a good deterrent and some info said that it was not. People ended the experiment more polarized than when they started with. People focus on what they believe. You may not do this consciously.
      •	Experiment with Wilson: Participants are told that they may be chosen or not chosen for a hypothetical date with a member of the opposite sex. Those who were told they were chosen spent more time looking at the positive characteristics of their date and those who were told that they were not chosen spent more time looking at the negative characteristics of their date. Sour grapes?
      •	Research: When televisions showed the same program, people sat next to the disabled people, presumably to show that they were not prejudiced vs disabled people. When the TVs showed different programs, they sat away from the disabled persons. Were they trying to rationalize their actions by having a reason (other channel) to sit away from the disabled people?
      14.6—Laugh and the World Laughs with You
      •	If other people believe that story about yourself, even if it is distorted, then you will be more happier or successful. Psych data about people who are construed to be more successful are more happy.
      •	Experiment: Men huff themselves when in the presence of attractive women. Women believe they are prettier in the company of other women when they are ovulating.
      If you believe your lies, you're more likely to get those lies believed.
      •	When people deceive others they get what they want. Self-deception is then obviously not an irrational thing. Deception can have some pragmatic value even if it doesn't have theoretical rationality behind it.
      •	The huffing thing is analog with Pascal's wager, more beneficial to huff rather than not huff. It is prudentially rational to huff yourself versus to not.
      •	Are self-enhancement (spin doctor) motives stronger than self-verification (get facts right) motives? It is akin to asking whether thirst is more important than hunger. Just as the desire to eat or drink is jointly determined by the current needs of the individual and the quality of resources, the desire to self-verify versus the desire to self-enhance should be jointly determined by current need states and the quality of available opportunities. Both enhancing and verifying needs are likely to be present all the time and the relative strengths will be based on the relative merits of each at that time.
      •	It doesn't seem to be a battleground, but it is more of two complementary processes. You want to keep facts but you also want to self-promote and self-enhance.
  14.7—What Self
  •	Criticism: Is it really true that we should assume that there is a self to be deceived? If we believe what we learned in Wilson, we have an different modules: there's the language module, facial recognition module, etc. Are we seeing ourselves as a single self or something else?
  •	Response: Data from cognitive psych say that maybe there is a central self because these modules are not completely independent from each other and there is a central "controller".
  •	Philo has the concept of a "person" (not the same as "human being"). Suppose that a kind group of aliens go here but are passive and intelligent, and we fall in love with them we may feel that these individuals are "persons" but not "human beings". Being a biological "human being" is not the same as being a modal "person".
  •	Some people think that the great apes should be considered as "persons" and not be put in a zoo, have experiments on them against their will in the same way that we don't want ourselves to be put in a zoo.
  •	So, what is a person? Being a person has some moral status and moral standard. Persons have experiences, memories, thoughts, etc... are these yourself? What notion of self is it that we can rest upon?
  •	Maybe there is no thyself to know?
  •	Philosophically, there are two ways of asking the question "what is a person".
  •	Synchronic: what is it for a hunk of flesh to be a person at a time?
  •	Dichronic: suppose you have a time-slice of a certain individual and you have another time-slice of the same individual, are those the same person? Hard to know what makes you the same as yourself as a baby given the vast number of changes that have occured with your life.
  •	This has repercussions on our legal system because a lot depends on the ability to make sure that we track people across time.
   
  15.3—Background of Herrigel
  •	Koan—You can't get my ideas without emptying your mind of your ideas.
  •	Herrigel—German philosopher and university professor during the 1920s-1930s. He was a Nazi sympathist.
  •	He was assigned to Tokyo and was fascinated with Zen Buddhism.
  •	There are thoughts behind Zen Buddhism but they are learned by practicing Zen.
  •	He opts to follow archery and zen flower arrangement.
  •	Zen archery is not at all about accuracy and hiting a target in a physical sense, but the aim of the archer is himself.
  •	So much of stuff in Zen is not about self-contemplating but is about self-mastery.
  Bow and arrow are just a pretext for something that could just as well happen without them, only the way to a goal, not the goal itself, only helps for the last decisive leap.
  •	Buddhism is not in the ordinary sense, but danna Buddhism or "Zen".
  •	So much of Zen is about immediate experience and being contemplative to the moment. There are things that can be talked about but not be described.
•	Like all mysticism, Zen can only be understood by people in Zen and become a mystic yourself. (Sounds like Freud?)
  15.4—Thinking Too Much
  •	Master Kenzo Awa—There are several bows with varying elasticity. The bows are 6 feet long. Awa told Herrigel that the bow is powered only by the two hands and the rest of his body must be completely still.
  •	While Herrigel improved his bow skills, he still had a problem with drawing the bow. It turns out that he had to breathe in correctly in order to draw the bow correctly. He was making a conscientious effort to relax, which the master found was a trouble.
•	When Herrigel was able to control his breathing, the bow drawing became considerably easier. (Adaptive unconscious: He taught his unconscious to breathe correctly.)
  •	Awa: Thinking too much is counterproductive.
  15.5—Second Natures
  •	Zen should be something that is effortless. This takes a long time because at first things are effortless.
  •	After months of training, he was still failing. In fact he was better before and he had to consciously use his right hand to release the arrow.
  •	When you are mastering something, you think too much of the mechanics of the activity and it's easy to fall apart. If a centipede thinks about each of his feet when he is moving, then he won't be able to move that much.
  •	The naturalness with which an infant grasps a finger is the kind of naturalness that he hopes Herrigel would achieve. Unlike the child who has an innate grasping ability, letting go of the arrow is of a second nature.
  •	It turns out that he can't wait for the shot because he can't hold his breath and he needs to breathe out.
  •	Awa says that H is still thinking about things too much. You contemplate or somatically mark the arrow in a negative way.
  •	A says that H needs to let go of himself and he has to let the feeling come to him.
  •	A says H must learn to wait properly and he must be some kind of an unpurposeless thing.
  15.6—Eyes that Hear, Ears that See
  •	Although H stroved to wait until the tension to let go, he still struggled with his shot.
  •	In the process of letting go of yourself, you have to focus on just one single thing, either on a breath, or a single word, etc.
  •	With practice and repetition everything becomes second nature. At some point the automaticity will take over.
  •	Once you have presence of mind you're not thinking of the activity itself, but you'll have some sort of intuition which you allow to guide you.
  •	All right doing is accomplished only in a state of selflessness and with no trace of egohood.
  •	There's a level where you don't concentrate of you that is not so much concentrating on the particular items but you're sensing it in an abstract way.
  •	When you're not too distracted, you won't have the chatter of consciousness imposing itself on your awareness. The "I should pay that bill" or "I should talk with my friend" disappears during a meditative moment or some focused things.
  •	Eyes that hear, ears that see—one can have this sentience without an awareness. Thinking about nothing. It's not an easy thing to achieve.
  15.7—Eugin Gets Busted
  •	H just wanted to let the arrow go and purpose and he couldn't do it any other way. At this point he had spent 3 years already.
  •	Day by day he had been focusing on losing his shot. It turns out that the fingers on the right hand gripped the bow too tightly.
  •	He had a different technique, a highly technical and non-Japanese solution and tried it, and it worked. When he came back to the practice hall and showed his technique the master took the bow and he was busted.
   
  16.2—Personal Identity: Two Concepts
  •	One of the aim of those who practice philosophy in the proper manner is to practice for dying and death. It does make sense in a way and that you shouldn't be perturbed by death.
  •	In Socrates' view, he think that the rational part of you will continue to exist and do things that he thinks is most pleasurable (thinking). There will be a self that will persist and you have to optimize that part of yourself while you are living.
  •	The idea of surviving past your death is questionable. Burnt ashes do not equal a pad of paper. Many say that a dead insect has no soul, so would a human have a soul?
  •	Review: Back to synchronic vs dichronic.
  •	Synchronic: what is it for a hunk of flesh to be a person at a time?
  •	Dichronic: suppose you have a time-slice of a certain individual and you have another time-slice of the same individual, are those the same person? Hard to know what makes you the same as yourself as a baby given the vast number of changes that have occured with your life.
  •	According to Locke, the idea of personal identity over time should be understood in terms of memory lengths/remembering things from an early age. The later person can remember experiences of the earlier age.
  •	While Boy 1 and Boy 2 might have experiences that are similar, they won't have all the experiences and memories of each other.
  Where P1 and P2 are person-stages, we say P2 is one and the same person as P1 just in case P2 does or can remember at least one experience had by P1.
  •	Problems with this
  •	Brave officer paradox: If a brave officer can remember stealing apples as a boy, but the old general cannot remember stealing apples, then are the three the same person? But by transitivity they should be the same person. Locks definition contradicts this.
  •	If you lose your memory and can't remember the old things, then are you still the same person as the old you?
  •	Multiple personality disorder: how many persons are there?
  •	You can't remember things as a baby: well it turns out that your earlier person stage can recall an earlier person stage so and so until you become a baby.
  Locke's refined criterion: Pn is one and the same person as P1 just in case Pn does or can remember at least one experience had by Pn-1, which does or can remember an experience had by Pn-2.. P1. This solves the brave officer paradox.
  16.3—Memento and Personal Identity
  •	Think of the movie Memento and Lenny. What seems to happen is that pre-accident Lenny has different selves, Lenny-at-11:00 remembers differently from Lenny-at-noon.
  •	Locke's theory can't handle crazy cases such as Lenny's but we do feel that they are the same person.
  If you ask a definition of identity, I confess I can give none; it is too simple a notion to admit of logical definition.
  – Thomas Reid
  •	Much like the notion of a point in geometry, which is the fundamental concept of geometry yet is difficult to define, the notion of a person is too self-evident and obvious.
  For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I can never catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything without the perception.
  ... identity is nothing really belonging to these different perceptions, and uniting them together; but it is merely a quality, which we attribute to them, because of the union of their ideas in the imagination, when we reflect upon them.
  – David Hume
  •	Hume's empiricist self says that we decide what counts what is being a person and who are the same persons.
  •	Locke says there is not a single entity that carries on throughout his life, each of his cells can change but the things he remember are what he is.
  •	Imagine a machine that can keep a copy of your blueprint, incinerate you, and produce a new copy of the blueprint. If this new copy calls yourself the same name and are you still the same self? Would you be willing to go into the machine? If you don't then your intuition of personal identity is a bodily version of personal identity (aka persisting state).
  •	Contrast changing a ship's planks and deconstructing/constructing the same ship—which of these do we perceive as "building a new ship" or "the ship persists through time"? In the same way, each of your cells changing—are you still the same person?
  •	Body continuity theory—the self that you persist despite the changes in your body.
  •	Both the Locke and body continuity theory suggest changes through time.
  16.4—Two Ways of Being Selfless
  •	Western: There can be great changes, although gradual, and you're still the same person.
  •	Buddhists think that there is no self-persisting self. 2 views:
  •	There is no self persisting through time. This does not make any sense.
  •	Even if we hold on to the idea of the persisting self, we should stop thinking of us as persons through time, we should not think of us as distinct over the physical world. We should be less focused on what it is persisting through time but we should think of what is important, not just to me.
  •	By separating and viewing yourself as a part of the whole, you'll be able to concentrate of the other good things to do etc.
  •	Even if there is a self, it is not a very important thing.

   
  17.2—A Koan the Tunnel
  Zenkai, the son of a samurai, journeyed to Edo and there became the retainer of a high official. He fell in love with the official's wife and was discovered. In self-defense, he slew the official. Then he ran away with the wife.
  Both of them later became thieves. But the woman was so greedy that Zenkai grew disgusted. Finally, leaving her, he journeyed far away to the province of Buzen, where he became a wandering mendicant.
  To atone for his past, Zenkai resolved to accomplish some good deed in his lifetime. Knowing of a dangerous road over a cliff that had caused the death and injury of many persons, he resolved to cut a tunnel through the mountain there.
  Begging food in the daytime, Zenkai worked at night digging his tunnel. When thirty years had gone by, the tunnel was 2,280 feet long, 20 feet high, and 30 feet wide.
  Two years before the work was completed, the son of the official he had slain, who was a skillful swordsman, found Zenkai out and came to kill him in revenge.
  "I will give you my life willingly," said Zenkai. "Only let me finish this work. On the day it is completed, then you may kill me."
  So the son awaited the day. Several months passed and Zendai kept on digging. The son grew tired of doing nothing and began to help with the digging. After he had helped for more than a year, he came to admire Zenkai's strong will and character.
  At last the tunnel was completed and the people could use it and travel in safety.
  "Now cut off my head," said Zenkai. "My work is done."
  "How can I cut off my own teacher's head?" asked the younger man with tears in his eyes.
  17.3—Buddhism as Philosophy
  Book: Buddhism as Philosophy by Sidderits
  •	Buddhism != religion, no salvation here, "we should not accept anyting on faith".
  •	Buddhism is not about a set of doctrines but a set of methods used to answer questions.
  •	Philosophizing is more about the journey than the destination.
  •	Classical India, and not just Greece, was an imporant place where philosophy flourished.
  •	Buddhist philos wanted more than the Greeks to overcome the concept of suffering.
  Nirvana
  •	Not as a state of transcendence but a liberation from the things that can potentially cause suffering.
  The Buddha
  •	The name Buddha isn't just a name but you can say that it is a person that can fight suffering.
  •	When Gautama was born, a seer told his dad that he will grow up to be either a Buddha or a world monarch.
  •	He will become a Buddha if he sees an old person, a sick person, a corpse, and a wandering renouncement.
  •	Because his dad wanted Gautama to become a monarch, he surrounded Gautama with young and healthy people.
  •	When he discovered the teachings of Buddhism, the god of death wanted to prevent him from sharing his knowledge with the world. The other gods wanted him to share the things, though.
  •	Context—It was common belief in India that we are reincarnated as the other creatures. Gautama thought that this was a fruitless cycle and he wanted to break it.
   
  17.4—Types of Suffering
  •	Suffering due to pain—When I cut my finger, when I get hit by a rock
  •	Suffering due to impermanence—We seem to just be doing a goal and achieving it, doing a goal and achieving it, and we get stuck with small satisfaction and each of those is impermanent. It's sad sometimes.
  •	Cyclical existence—What is the point of dying and rebirth? What would Nirvana be like?
  17.5—What Meditation is For
  •	Meditation is not just for relaxing but is a crucial part of the process that we do to alleviate suffering.
  •	Being aware of your faults means you get to overcome it.
  •	We want to come to realize that there is a part of yourself that is not identical with an individual thought in your head.
  •	There is a sentience that can happen without thinking of what you have to do as a person.
  •	We want to appreciate this small part of yourself that will transcend your veryday problems.
  17.6—Buddha's Speech
  •	Arguments for the non-existence of the self
  •	Parts of the self in their context
  •	Rupa, anything corporeal or physical.
  •	Feeling, sensations of pleasure, pain, and indifference.
  •	Perception, mental events by one grasps the characteristics of a perceptible object.
  •	Volition, responsible for bodily and mental activity.
  •	Consciousness, the awareness of physical and mental states.
  The blessed one's speech
  •	Rupa is not a self, you can't  say "let my rupa be this way, let not my rupa be that way"
  •	Consciousness is not a self because you can't say "let my consciousness be this way, or not that way"
  •	Same goes for feeling, perception , and volition
  •	There are different views but the correct view is "this is not mine", "this is not myself", he respects all perceptions, volitions, feelings, and consciousness, irrespective of what they say.
  •	When we think of it this way, then he lets go of the feeling, the perception, the volition, etc.
  His Argument
  •	Premise:  Every part of the self is impermanent and if there was a self, then it would be permanent.
  •	For there to be a self that persists through time, there should be a component of thyself that should be unchanged through time.
  •	Contrast this idea with the Ship of Theseus, we can still say that it continues to exist even if every part changes as long as there was enough continuity. Same with you changing your cells and changing your consciousness.
  •	In the  same vein, there is no need for psychological permanence.
  •	Problem with "Rupa is impermanent" theory : ambiguous. In one sense it is impermanent because your body is constantly changing. In another sense it is perfectly permanent because the ship/your persists even if the body is changed.
  •	The Buddhist argument against the persistence of one's self makes sense but doesn't seem to undermine Western theory on the dichronic theory of personality identity.
   
  17.7—No Synchronic Identity
  •	Buddha says don't make sweeping assumptions about the identity of one's self.
  •	It's hard to not think about assumptions though, we call ourselves "I, me"
  •	Buddhist tradition solves this with
  •	Conventional  truth—Acceptable to common sense and leads to good practice. Budd accepts this.
  •	Ultimate truths—Factual, presupposes existence of conceptual fictions. Budd doesn't accept this.
  •	Non-reductionist view: both body and mind theories of self are wrong. The concept of having no self means that you live and you die. Parker says that the non-reductionist view made him think about death more.
  •	"If I giveup on the idea of myself as a self, I will still believe in the experiences, volition, etc., but they would just be treated as "things" that have been aggregated over an area.
  Friends
  •	Your motivation for checking out a book that a friend says is interesting  is less than if you say it is interesting.
  •	You: Here is something that will satisfy your interest.
  •	When you feel the pain of others, even literally, then it is said that you are no longer experiencing things "by yourself". Once these walls break down we take a different view, we may become more altrusitic.
   
  17.8—Some Buddhist Metaphysics
  Story
  •	Malinda was an Indian king and received this advice from Nāgasena: "You are a delicate prince and if you walk on foot, your body gets tired, your feet become sore, your consciouness suffers."
  •	Malinda replies: "I came on a chariot."
  •	"Are the wheels, the tire, the body, the chariot?" "No." "Combined, is there a chariot?" "No."
  •	Nāgasena manages to convince Malinda to say that the chariot is at best a fiction, and all that exists are the parts of which it is composed.
  Mereological reductionism
  •	The idea that a whole can be reduced without continuing to exist to the components with which it was built. There is no such things as a chariot, it's just what they were composed of.
  •	This regresses to atoms/etc, and that tables, chairs, galaxies don't exist.
  •	Until we don't have  consensus on what things are really made of, MR is really weird.
  •	Two different reductions
  •	Limitative—When you see a tusk, if you say it's a unicorn horn, and I say that it is a narwhal tusk because there are no such thing as unicorn horns, then what I am saying is that this thing continues to exist, but the idea that we're describing it as a unicorn horn is incorrect, because there are no unicorns.
  •	Preservative—Lightning is  electrical discharge. They aren't saying that lightning doesn't exist, they're just saying that you can reduced lightning to electrical discharge.
  •	Malinda should have said that you can believe in chariots because its a preservative reduction and Nāgasena's explanation is just a general and macroscopic definition of a chariot.
  Synchronic Self
  •	By the same logic as above we can also doubt the Buddhist notion of a self.
  •	Believing in a self had better explain something. What would believing a momentary synchronic self account for?
  •	Believing in keeping track of a person over time (dichronic) has practical value in detecting if aperson is still the same person for accountability.
   
  18.1—What is Ethics
  •	Some acts are right, some acts are wrong, what makes acts right and wrong?
  •	It doesn't seem like a matter of convention. We don't say that child torture is a matter of convention.
  •	It doesn't seem like it is purely a matter of your point of view.
  •	Ethical relativism, while people find it attractive, is not really true. Ex: human sacrifices, just because some think that it is right or okay, it doesn't mean that there is no objective truth for things.
  •	"Ethics is all relative" and "different people have different views" is wrong in the way that even though people have different views on the causes of sickness, there is an objective and ethical truth to the causes of being sick. Moral relativism is too much of sidestepping shit.
  •	Robust relativism: There is no actual right and wrong.
  There is a temptation among people to think about ethics as a point of view but that view is not as attractive as you think.
  •	This is important because you report people on ethical violations depending on if you are a moral relativist or not. Surely though, you can report on others without being hegemonic about yourself, right?
   
  18.2—Utilitarianism
  •	Think of overall happiness besides your own.
  •	When deciding to perform an act, think of the greatest amount of happiness as awhole that can be done.
  •	Don't be an egoist (doing things for your own benefit). Bentham/Mill thought that if everyone was utilitarian then the world would be a better place.
  •	Criticism: You can't maintain this because you will be disoriented from your family/friends.
  •	JB: To maximize utility, it would depend on your psychological profile (some people like this, some people like that).
  •	If you accept Ut, then you have to think of what kind of a person you are.
  •	Criticism: Ut thinks or expects us to be heroes.
  •	Crit: In order to do something to get maximum utility, I have to spend effort on this and is hard to calculate. Relate to Damasio's somatic theory/"no you don't have to calculate always".
  •	Maximization of overall happiness doesn't seem to think about rights. If you'e a ut you might have to violate the rights of an individual for the society. Think of harvesting organs or cells from babies, etc.
  •	At some point ut will clash vs freedom!
   
  18.3—Deontology
  •	Kant
  •	There are certain acts and certain things to be done to yourself and to others that are not supposed to be done.
  •	Ex: Using someone as a means to your ends in such a way that they couldn't be aware of things, or not respecting people as a person, such as lying to someone else for money.
  •	Evenif doing so produces an overall positive happiness in the world, that is still immoral because it fails to respect the view as a person.
  •	Never treat anybody in a way that if they were aware of the situation, then they would not consent to the truth.
  •	Treating someone as a means is alright (going to the bank to get cash from the teller) but covering your intentions with a lie or a lie in promise is a violation of the Kantian beliefs.
  •	Kant also doesn't like using others to save lives, because the vagrant would probably not accept being euthanized in order to save another lives and thus it would be wrong because you'd be using him as a mere means.
  •	Even if there is an overall happiness, it's still wrong accdg to Kant.
  •	But what if you can save a million lives? Some say that numbers should matter. Some can also say that it depends on the number. Ex: Torturing a terrorist's daughter to save a million lives because you are using a daughter as a means to an end.
   
  18.4—Selfless Ethics
  •	Contrast ut and de vs Buddhism's "no self" theory.
  •	What would our lives be like if we give up the idea of "selves"?
  •	Giving up on the idea of a self would reduce your feelings of envy because the notion of envy presupposes the idea that another "self" owns this and your "self" would like to have this thing that they own.
  •	You would become less attached about things.
  To be moral from a point of view of Buddhist ethics is to give other's welfare no less weight than onegives to his own welfare.
  •	Compare with ut which says "there's not as much happiness as there could be, we should maximize it". They agree somehow.
  •	They contrast in that in ut says that "if the numbers work out right, you are allowed to cause a certain amount of unhappiness in order to produce a balance of happiness (ex: euthanasia) someone else".
  •	Buddhism does not want to have this sum of suffering, it just says that "you see suffering, you should try to lessen it, period." Think of suffering in the local sense.
  "If I do not prevent the suffering of others because it does not hurt me, what is the point of preventing the suffering of the future body that likewise does not hurt me?"
  Suffering, both one's own and that of others is to be prevented to the best of one's ability.
   
  18.5—The Three Poisons
  •	The three poisons: greed, hatred, delusion
  •	Getting rid of them brings you to a state of nirvana.
  •	Greed—Llike envy, but you can be greedy without being envious.
  •	Delusion—Buddhism wants you to have a clear view of the world.
  •	Hatred—Does hating someone tarnish you? While it is justifiable to hate mass murderers torturers etc, by hating them you feel a negative emotion against them and you won't be able to be motivated as a person.
  •	Hatred is, if you were living in a happy world, something you can get rid off.
  •	The question is, would it be a better world if there was nothing to hate? Yes.
  •	Ridding one's self of poisions is something that is only really possible if the world is in the right kind of state. If the world has a lot of contemptible acts then it is okay to feel the poisons. In order to rid yourself of the poisons, then you have to find a way of making the world not poisoned.
   
  16.2—Self Knowledge as a Motley
  •	Understanding yourself is not achieved by going along one path and one way.
  •	There is are a number of things that constitute self-knowledge and self-understanding.
  •	Introspection might work for some things but not for all.
  •	There is a subconscious part of the mind, you can't figure out your subconscious on your own, but you can find out things about yourself by getting a third-person perspective of yourself or by talking others.
  •	For the preconscious parts, think of the emotionally ambiguous moments in your life, ex: someone doesn't greet you, if you study your immediate reactions, you can find out stuff about yourself. People can draw momentous conclusions based on split-second responses and interpretations to socially ambiguous situations.
  •	Think of a yearbook, you'll have memories of those people and emotions will have manifest and you can find out about your gut responses. Watch how you react as you perceive the world, either the past states or present states or future states. These reveal things about yourself.
  •	Don't just pay attention to stimuli but check your response to those stimuli.
   
  16.3—Self Knowledge and  the Freedom of Will
  •	Think again of freedom of action or freedom of will (can I still willfully make decisions?).
  •	As you achieve self-knowledge, you may find things that you don't really like about what you discover.
  •	Once we get that level of self-knowledge, you have to ask yourself if that is the kind of person you want to be.
  •	Doing things makes you discover things about yourself.
  •	Sometimes discovering things about yourself makes you have less malleable beliefs about things.
  •	To increase the value of our lives, we should work on our will, we don't need to take things at face value.
  •	Think of yourself as a swarm, where the swarm is experiences, memories, emotions with no definable boundary.
  16.4—Self-Knowledge and Lifes Meaning
  •	The idea of the meaning of life is attractive because by knowing this, you'd know what is worth your time.
  •	Any scenario where you actually get to find the meaning of life would make other people not believe in whatever you believe is the meaning.
  •	A sentence using the word "the" means that there is at least one such thing and there is at most one such thing (Bertrand Russell), the same goes for "the meaning of life".
  •	How do we know that life has meaning at all?
  •	Existentialism: No meaning at all
  •	Nietzche: The most we can do is to create meaning for ourselves rather than discover it for ourselves.
  •	Pluralist: Maybe there are different things that count for the meaning.
  •	How about just find something that can become the "meaning for life"?
  •	It seems that at some point the world will be destroyed and everything is fleeting.
  •	What gives meaning to most lives is the hope for a better place elsewhere or for eternity.
  •	How can something that is forever give you meaning?
  •	As opposed to finding the meaning of life, how about finding the value in some of the things that we do?
  •	Intrinsic rather than extrinsic value. We care about money as a means to an end.
  •	If you don't ask yourself why you are doing things, then maybe you are not getting full value.
  •	Self-examination is really important to figure out things if the things you care about are really things that you care about.
  •	Ask yourself why you do the things you do and if you really like to do things for the sake of doing it.
   
  17.1—TA Round Table 1
  •	Zen vs Psychological Flow?
  •	Pretty reasonable to see Zen practices as early appreciations of the importance of flow for well-being.
  •	When we're not watching ourselves, we tend to perform better.
  •	Soldiers train tens of thousands of times to make things automatic.
  •	Trying to make yourself automatic has contradictions—"I want to become purposeless on purpose"?
  •	Becoming purposeless on purpose might be dichronic—on Tue I'm trying to be purposeless, on Wed I won't.
  •	Try to subtract things as you move forward. Think of hiking for several days, you lose and lose purpose as you move forward.
  •	Is being purposeless possible or ideal?
  •	It's naive to think that you can cleanse yourselves of hatred. Envy, maybe possible to cleanse yourself of that.
  17.2—TA Round Table 2
  •	How about greed?
  •	Greed is not about getting more for yourself, but it's about more than you need, even if there is no one else around.
  •	Meaning of life—accept that it's unsolvable, or should we just try harder?
  •	We tend to the latter because there are other things that have been solved after a ton of time.
  •	Even if
