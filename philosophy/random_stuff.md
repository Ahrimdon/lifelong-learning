## [Kant's Critique of Pure Reason](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLwiBg4sCaE)

Your knowledge of space and time may arise with experience, but not from experience.

We cannot know reality in ourself (numenal world). We can only know reality as we see it through our spectacles. So science, math, religion are destroyed by Kant. These work, but aren't real knowledge.

Numenal and phenomenal world. Phenomenal = what we see.

He thinks that it's better if we think that objects can form in the mind, not form in the world. The mind is not a blank slate and it is active. We can discover how it is active not just by looking out into the world, but examining the lenses.

The Newtonian view of space is not necc for the Kantian view. What Kant says presupposes Einstein or other science stuff, he presupposes science. Einstein = empirical properties. The first step of science is observation, and this presupposes categories by which to observe.

Most of us struggle to survive and we want things that work (appliances etc), not random deeper knowledge.

Pure Reason - he considers reason stripped of all content.

Transcendental idealism: The attempt to understand what is in place a priori to understand what it is in all.

Intuition: To behold, the necessary conditions or must be in the spectacles to experience anything at all.

Hume: Knowledge is either synthetic ("A dog is on the table"), a prosteriori because we learn these things from experience. Negating them does not lead to a self-contradiction. Analytic statements are contradictory when negated, for example: "It is not the case that all bachelors are single." These are a priori, you know it without thinking, you don't need to ask all bachelors. The same with math (2 + 2 = 4). Analytic statements are relations of ideas. 4 is contained in 2 and 2, single is contained in the concept of bachelor.

He believed that analytic statements are trivial because they don't tell about the world. Hume is an empiricist because he believes that all nontrivial knowledge comes from empirical experience. A rationalist believes that some forms of non-trivial forms of knowledge do not come from empirial evidence.

Kant shows that Humes' fork is a false dichotomy: there is a third form of knowledge, synthetic a priori. It's a priori but is not a relation of ideas, and it isn't a definition game. It actually tells us what it is in the world. It's synthetic a priori (spectacles). Ex: "7 + 5 = 12, 2 + 2 =4, events have causes, you can always increase the length of a line." It doesn't come from experience (not synthetic), it's also not analytic because the ideas are not connected (events are not connected to causes, and increasing is not  connected to the line). We need an intuition.

The critique aims to answer one question: How is synthetic a priori knowledge possible? It's only acceptable if we believe in trancendental idealism.

The transcendental aesthetic deals with objects as they're given to us by experience, which he calls intuitions, rather than objects as they are thought, which he considers concepts.

Space and time are a priori intuition (formed experiences, not something we get from experience.) Every experience must have form and space/time must be in the spectacles.

Premise 1: Space is presupposed.
