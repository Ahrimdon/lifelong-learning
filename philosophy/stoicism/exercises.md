- "View from above". If someone just rejected you, try to see yourself in the third person and keep zooming out. Envision the scale of the universe and think of all the things that can possibly happen and that puts your problem into perspective. **Things only bother you if you put significance into them.**
- "Negative visualization." Our loved ones may not be with us for long. What would it be like if I didn't have clean water, or lose loved ones, or exiled from my country, or lose my arm or leg. It's basically contemplating things that could happen, but haven't happened. This draws attention to how lucky you are. You can lose these, but you haven't lost them so far. In reality, everything you have is borrowed.
- "Voluntary discomfort." Cold showers, sleeping on the floor. Fasting the entire day. This is a way of making yourself tougher. You are basically going to do things that are uncomfortable so you are ready when they happen.
