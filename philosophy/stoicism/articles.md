[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/9-stoic-practices-that-will-help-you-thrive-in-the-madness-of-modernity-af9f1bdd56f4)

- ***Develop an Internal Locus of Control.*** Unhappiness comes from emotional responses we have chosen.
- ***Guard Your Time.*** Unlike money, this cannot be earned again. Calendars and schedules are meant to help us, we should not be a slave to them.
- ***Don't Outsource Your Happiness.***
- ***Stay Focused When Confronted With Distractions.*** When you're overwhelmed with choices, the default choice is to maintain the status quo.
- ***Toss Away Ego and Vanity.***
- ***Consolidate Your Thoughts in Writing.*** Journal = boosts creativity, increases gratitude, and serves as therapy all at once.
- ***Stand Your Ground.*** Cato doesn't forego his principles for tolerance or for profit. He eventually became Rome's arbiter of right and wrong.
- ***Imagine The Worst That Could Happen.*** Premeditation of evils. The goal is to imagine the worst events that could possibly happen to them. Loss of reputation? Financial ruin/poverty? This leads to asking yourself questions like: "What would things look like if everything went wrong tomorrow?", "How would I cope with that situation?", and "Should I change the way I live today?"
- ***Remember That Nothing Endures.***

## The Philosophy Of Stoicism: Five Lessons from Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Zeno of Citium.
[Reference](https://dailystoic.com/stoicism-five-lessons/)

- ***Live every day as if it were your last.*** “You live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.”
- ***Food is the best test of self-control.*** What is the purpose of food, anyway? “That God who made man provided him food and drink for the sake of preserving his life and not for giving him pleasure, one can see very well from this: when food is performing its real function, it does not produce pleasure for man, that is in the process of digestion and assimilation.”
- ***Failure is natural, regret is foolish.*** "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."
  - Everything that happens, whether good or bad, is an opportunity to practice virtue.
  - Negative visualizations, and don't be surprised by failure. Expect it, embrace it, and seek after obstacles in your life which seem uncomfortable.
  - The moment you start to regret something in the past means you're acting against something you fundamentally cannot control. There is no practical reward from doing so, only frustration and anger.
  - The past is good for learning, not for regret.
- ***Focus on the small things.***
  - Well-being is attained by little and little, and nevertheless is no little thing itself.
  - It's not about big wins, but small wins that combine daily.
- ***Throw away vanity.***
  - "It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows."
  - Be willing to learn, be willing to listen, be willing to leave your ego aside to learn, evolve, and develop through the wisdom of others and through embracing the joy of ignorance.

# The Stoic: 9 Principles to Help You Keep Calm in Chaos
[Reference](https://99u.adobe.com/articles/24401/a-makers-guidebook-9-stoic-principles-to-nurture-your-life-and-work)

- The Stoics focus on two things: "How can we lead a fulfilling, happy life?" "How can we become better human beings?"
- The goal of Stoicism is to attain inner peace by overcoming adversity, practicing self-control, being conscious of our impulses, realizing our ephemeral nature and the short time allotted.
- ***Acknowledge that all emotions come from within.*** "Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside." — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
  - It's not outside forces that make us feel something, but what we tell ourselves that create our feelings. A blank list is not stressful, it's your thoughts that are stressing you out.
  - When we flee from reality, we are doing nothing but harming ourselves and undermining our self-discipline. The next time you run into an obstacle, don't look at what's around you, instead, look within.
- ***Find someone you respect, and use them to stay honest.*** “Choose someone whose way of life as well as words, and whose very face as mirroring the character that lies behind it, have won your approval. Be always pointing him out to yourself either as your guardian or as your model. This is a need, in my view, for someone as a standard against which our characters can measure themselves. Without a ruler to do it against you won’t make the crooked straight.” — Seneca, Letters From a Stoic
  - Whatever you do, there are individuals that you can learn from. Study their story, their works, techniques, successes, failures, interviews.
  - This is not an exercise of comparison. How can you learn from your heroes?
- ***Recognize there is life after failure.*** “Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself? So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
- ***Read purposefully, and apply your knowledge.*** “Don’t just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.” — Epictetus, The Art of Living
  - Reading prepares your mind, even helps you avoid foolish mistakes, but at the end of it all there must be the result of some action: a failure, maybe a success, or a lesson.
- ***Challenge yourself to be brutally honest.*** “‘A consciousness of wrongdoing is the first step to salvation.’ A person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing it before you can reform.  So—to the best of your ability—demonstrate your own guilt, conduct inquiries of your own into all the evidence against yourself. Play the first part of prosecutor, then of judge and finally of pleader in mitigation. Be harsh with yourself at times.” — Seneca, Letters From a Stoic
  - "Why am I feeling this way right now?"
  - When you feel resistance, use that as a cue to go forward.
- ***Reflect on what you spend the most time on.*** “A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
  - In my own observations, people who do excellent work, who master their craft, do so because of their ability to prioritize. They honor every hour of their day. If we put cameras behind our heroes, would our work ethic compare? Our focus? Our determination to get things done?
- ***Remind yourself: you weren't meant to procrastinate.*** “At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: ‘I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
- ***Put the phone away and be present.*** “Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.” — Seneca, Letters From a Stoic
  - Throughout your day find a moment, however fleeting, to just sit and be still. Doesn’t matter where you are. Take a few deep breathes, put your phone on vibrate so there’s no chance of interruption, and just reflect on the series of events that took place throughout your day. When you’re working, be ruthlessly present. Let your mind focus on the task at hand, what you’re trying to accomplish, and do it with diligence, patience, attentiveness, and care. Sooner or later, you’ll realize how much of an asset this is to your creativity and overall quality of life.
- ***Remind yourself that time is our most precious resource.*** “Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you’re alive and able — be good.” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
  - It provides a sense of urgency, to realize that you've lived a certain number of hours and the hours ahead of you are not guaranteed as the ones you have lived.
  - This makes our self-respect, work ethic, generosity, self-awareness, attention, and growth evermore important. The last thing any of us wants to do is die with regret.
  - The way we lead our lives and do our work must embody the principles that we practice. Less comparing, criticizing, and consuming; more creating, learning, and living.

# Stop Trying to Be Happy
[Reference](https://markmanson.net/stop-trying-to-be-happy)

- Just as a confident man doesn't wonder if he's confident, a happy man does not wonder if he's happy. He simply is. So finding happiness is not achieved in itself, but rather it is a side effect of a set of life experiences.
- You can't buy happiness, and you can't achieve happiness. It just is.
- Pleasure: correlated to happiness, but it doesn't cause it. People who focus their energy on materialistic and superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and less happy in the long run.
- The joy of life is not having that 100K salary, it's working to reach that 100K salary, that 200K salary, and so on. Raise your expectations, elongate your process, have standards, learn from it, live it.
- Denying negative emotions leads to deeper and more prolonged negative emotions and emotional dysfunction.
- Things go wrong. Negative emotions are necessary and healthy for maintaining a stable baseline happiness.
- *Happiness is the process of being your ideal self: completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. Raising a child makes us happier than beating a video game. Starting a small business with friends and struggling to make money makes us happier than buying a new computer.*
- It's not finishing the marathon that makes us happy, it's achieving a difficult long-term goal that does. It's not having an awesome kid that makes us happy, but knowing that you gave yourself up to the growth of another human being that is special.
- This is why trying to be happy inevitably will make you unhappy. Because trying to be happy implies that you are not already inhabiting your ideal self, and you are not aligned with the qualities of who you wish to be.
- This is why happiness is so fleeting. Anyone who has set out major life goals for themselves only to achieve them and realize that they feel the same relative amounts of happiness and unhappiness always feels like it's around the corner.

# You're Supposed to Struggle
[Reference](https://lifehacker.com/youre-supposed-to-struggle-1823744506)

- You will struggle, you will die, and all of the material items you accumulated will no longer be yours.
- Be happy you have the gift of life, but remember that nothing of yours is lost when you die.
- Our bodies belong to nature, so you must be ready to give yours back when it’s time.
- If you’re struggling right now, know that you are merely fulfilling your duty as a living thing in this world. To live is to struggle.
- "To struggle is only natural" is not meant to be depressing. It's meant to be freeing and comforting. You're not cursed, you're not smited, and you're not incapable of riding out the storm.

# Reddit Thread on Closure
[Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/8v3mo3/how_do_stoics_move_on_with_a_lack_of_closure/)

- Acceptance. Acceptance doesn't mean it's resolved, just that you accept that there is no resolution.
- Accept that they have that image of you, and that it is false. Your being, your inner world, does not changes because someone else thinks negatively of you.
- If they misinterpreted your actions, that is YOUR closure. You were misinterpreted, and maybe in time they on their own will realize this.
- You are only responsible for what you are, not for what others consider you to be.
- To me, a desire for closure reminds me of Epictetus's discussion on what we find reasonable. We are only upset by what we find unreasonable. We are content with what we find reasonable. For me, a desire for closure from someone is rooted in not being able to explain or reason through their actions and thoughts. And we find that lack of explanation unreasonable. Thus, we suffer.
- Why would you let your heart be dragged along by someone who wasn't there? Give yourself permission to accept the mystery and leave it aside without a complete perfect answer.
- You are not the first nor the last person to never receive closure. Most people are left without closure at some point in their life. Even if you did get closure, it might not have mattered much anyway. I'd still be in the same position.
- Don't crave complete explanations. We can't always have the answers we want. We can always accept the information we're given.
- In my view, closure is a fake construct driven by one’s need to tell a story about some event. Needing such a story is the same as an attachment; it is rooted in fear and ego.
- Divorce: I'm kind of a black and white person, and so for me, because we're not going to have any interaction after the agreement is signed, I've been able to think of her as a none person. That's how I've chosen to deal with it. Essentially there's a million things I would love to say to her - tell her off and make her regret all her poor choices, but I'd be saying it to someone who doesn't even really exist, so what's the point?

# Reddit FAQ
[Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_resources)

- Some things are up to us, a consequence of our character; everything else is not up to us, and independent of our character. Things which we appear only to influence can and should be separated into factors that are entirely up to us, and entirely independent of us.
- External events are not features of our character, and so can be neither good or bad.
- Four basic virtues (properties of an excellent character): wisdom, justice, courage, and self-control. It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about these things.
- Stoic practices and exercises
  - Whenever you remember to do it, refrain from giving automatic assent to mistaken impressions, and refrain from automatically acting on impulses. Instead, observe them as mere impressions and impulses. This implies some level of detachment, and somewhat resembles Buddhist mindfulness mediation, although it is not meant to be practiced continuously during all activities.
  - Consider whether it is under your control or not if something is good or bad. If not, and it is of something that has actually happened or is actually happening, accept it with reverence.
  - Before you choose to do anything, consider whether it is according to nature or an impulse of the moment, and act accordingly.
  - Regular consideration of one's situation and surroundings from a purely physical perspective, breaking things down into their physical parts, or looking at the from a "in relation to eternity and all that exists in the universe).
  - Reading Stoic literature - just like reading books about physiology and exercise can get you in shape, reading about philosophy can help improve the effectiveness of the other exercises you do.
  - Mental rehearsal: "I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my fellow human or hate him, without my decision to choose that opinion. The harm is done in my response to their actions, not in their actions.
  - Mental review of recent events in the light of Stoic principals, possibly followed by mental rehearsing of doing them as if you had followed those principals. If recent events are now out of your control, then it is a mistake to even look at them as good or bad. The goal rather is to train yourself not to make the same mistake in the future.
  - Practicing the consequences of difficult events and reacting to them as a Sage would. Things like practicing self-denial, in which you consciously decide not to enjoy something for a time. This will help you be grateful for what you have, but also keep you from attaching your happiness to having things that are ultimately not entirely in your control.
  - Building social bonds that will reinforce one's progress as an influence separate from the influences of a popular society.
- What is virtue: Living in accordance with nature.
  - According to Aristotle, a thing followed its nature when it was growing or changing because of what it was -- because of its own characteristics -- rather than due to what was being done to it. For example, when an oak tree grows from an acorn, it is following its nature, but when a carpenter cuts it into lumber and builds a bed with it, it is not.
  - Vice, they thought, is caused by bad external influences or immaturity. Following nature is the same as being virtuous, which is being a fully mature, flourishing rational being, while being vicious is the same as being childish, sick, or injured. The intuition for what is mature and what is not seems similar to that assumed by modern English idioms like "He was the adult in the room." or "He was acting childishly."
  - Let us see in practice what we mean by “good.” Take a good bootmaker, a good father, a good musician, a good horse, a good chisel ; you will find that each one of them has some function to perform, some special work to do ; and a good one does the work well. Goodness is performing your function well. But when we say “well” we are still using the idea of goodness. What do we mean by doing it “well”?
- Preferred or unpreferred indifferent:
  - Something is of value if its presence can improve, or if it is a fair price an informed buyer will pay for something in the market, or if it is something a wise person may use to select among actions.
  - A preferred indifferent: "winning the game" is "it's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game". It's like an unbiased spectator who would watch a game where he would like to see player A strive to win, but would be indifferent to whether or not player A actually wins. *The Stoic tries to apply this attitude to everything in life, striving to attain preferred indifferents rather than unpreferred ones, but ultimately indifferent to whether or not they are actually attained.*
  - ***Whether an act is appropriate depends on whether it is reasonable for achieving more over less preferred indifferents. A reasonable course of action does not guarantee any given result, however. People being unreasonable sometimes "get lucky," while reasonable strategies often fail. To the Stoic, however, what is important is the act itself, not its consequences. An appropriate act which actually ends up with an unpreferred indifferent is no worse than one which results in a preferred one, and does not imply that the actor should have done otherwise, even if an inappropriate act would have turned out better. Hence, the actual outcome is truly indifferent.***
- While these indifferents were seen as preferred for their own sake, others were seen as preferred because they tended to be useful. Examples of secondary preferred indifferents are wealth and status. Some indifferents, like strength and abilities, were seen as both preferred for their own sake and also because of their utility.

## ELI5:

- Remember when your gold fish died, and you felt sad? Well, think about these three things:
- Sadness is a bad feeling, right? And you have some control over how you feel about things. Remember that time you did a dance for show and tell, and at first you kept thinking about how the other kids might laugh at you, and it wasn't fun, but then you stopped worrying about that, and it was fun? Well, I know that while you were doing your dance today, you were feeling sad, because you were thinking sad things about your gold fish. But, if you had just been thinking about Mr. Happyfin in a different way, or not at all, you could have been happy. And happy is a good feeling.
- There are these forces of nature, and they led to your fish dying. But they also led to your birthday, and your mom loving you, and that pretty butterfly outside the window. Everything in the whole world is connected by these forces. The whole universe is one big thing, and just like how you love your sister even though she can be annoying sometimes, you should love the universe, and all its parts, even if some of those parts might make you feel sad at first.
- Happiness is a part of you. What feels happiness and sadness? You do. You're the one who's responsible for all the emotions you ever feel, and while at first you may be tempted to feel bad about Mr. Happyfin's death, why should you? Mr. Happyfin died, but that has nothing to do with the real you. And neither did the time your friends made fun of you at school because you wore a pink shirt, nor the time you scraped your knee, nor the time you lost your lunch money. None of those things made the real, inner you better or worse, so why should you feel bad because of them?

## What motivates a Stoic?

- Imitation is a basic human impulse. Children imitate their parents and others around them. Adults continue to have an instinct to imitate those they admire, adopting role models, heroes, and (when taken to an extreme) idols. We react to others and ourselves with admiration or disgust, pride or shame. We have a strong natural impulse to be good and admirable ourselves. If this were not the case, then low self-esteem would not be unpleasant, or high self-esteem, pleasant.
- High self-esteem was not in itself, however, a goal of the Stoics. What the Stoics were after could not have been supplied by an experience machine. Instead, they focused on judging ones-self accurately and fairly, and then actually being worthy of esteem: of being virtuous. *Put differently, the feeling of being a good person was not the goal, but rather the Stoics were attempting actually to achieve excellence.*
- For when is a vine faring badly? When it is acting contrary to its own nature. When is a cock faring badly? Under the same conditions. So also man. What, then, is his nature? To bite, and kick, and throw into prison, and behead? No, but to do good, to work together, and to pray for the success of others. Therefore, he is faring badly, whether you will or no, when he acts unfeelingly.
- Just as you too do not say that the cock which has won a victory, even though he be severely cut up, has fared badly, but rather the one who has been beaten without suffering a blow. Nor do you call a dog happy when he is neither in pursuit nor toiling hard, but when you see him sweating, suffering, bursting from the chase. What is there paradoxical in the statement, if we say that everything's evil is what is contrary to its own nature? Is that paradoxical? Do you not say it yourself in the case of everything else? Why, then, do you take a different course in the case of man alone? But our statement that the nature of man is gentle, and affectionate, and faithful, is this not paradoxical? — No, that is not paradoxical, either. — How, then, does it come about that he suffers no harm, even though he is soundly flogged, or imprisoned, or beheaded? Is it not thus — if he bears it all in a noble spirit, and comes off with increased profit and advantage, while the other man is the one who suffers harm, the man who is subjected to the most pitiful and disgraceful experience, who becomes a wolf, or a snake, or a wasp, instead of a human being?
- ***The way to achieve a sense of meaning, then, is to properly understand ones true purpose, and then actually achieve it, which is done through engaging in virtuous endeavors (being virtuous). From the Stoic point of view, it is important to remember that it is not the feeling of a sense of meaning that is important. Rather, the feeling is merely a useful tool for identifying when one is not living as virtuously as one might, so that one might change how one lives when such change is needed.***
