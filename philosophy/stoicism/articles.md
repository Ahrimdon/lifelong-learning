- ***Develop and Internal Locus of Control.*** Unhappiness comes from emotional responses we have chosen.
- ***Guard Your Time.*** Unlike money, this cannot be earned again. Calendars and schedules are meant to help us, we should not be a slave to them.
- ***Don't Outsource Your Happiness.***
- ***Stay Focused When Confronted With Distractions.*** When you're overwhelmed with choices, the default choice is to maintain the status quo.
- ***Toss Away Ego and Vanity.***
- ***Consolidate Your Thoughts in Writing.*** Journal = boosts creativity, increases gratitude, and serves as therapy all at once.
- ***Stand Your Ground.*** Cato doesn't forego his principles for tolerance or for profit. He eventually became Rome's arbiter of right and wrong.
- ***Imagine The Worst That Could Happen.*** Premeditation of evils. The goal is to imagine the worst events that could possibly happen to them. Loss of reputation? Financial ruin/poverty? This leads to asking yourself questions like: "What would things look like if everything went wrong tomorrow?", "How would I cope with that situation?", and "Should I change the way I live today?"
- ***Remember That Nothing Endures.***
