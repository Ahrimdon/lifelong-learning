## The 7 Pillars of Stoicism: How To Live An Extraordinary Life No Matter What Happens To You
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2DeRE1MnUw)

- The only thing you can actually control of is your thoughts.
- Set realistic expectations. Expect that your life will have trials. Your life will always be bombarded with the things that can go wrong. Accept that bad, unpredictable things are going to happen. "Whatever happens is 100% natural."
- Be present-minded. Most people are thinking about the past or are thinking about the future. You can miss out of opportunities on the moment. Notice everything around you can focus on the current day.
- Freedom from the external. Many people trade their freedom when they should only be trading their dollars. Your happiness should depend not on external things. The way of the stoic is to b free from the external by being content without the external.
- Acceptance that everything will end. Accept that we're all going to die at some point.
- Courage over fearlessness: if you experience fear regularly or you worry a lot, what you need is courage. Do what scare you so many times that it has no effect on you anymore and as a result not only are you more fearless, you are more confident as well. If you are shy and uncertain of your abilities, you need competence, not confidence.

- Most powerful thing: "You don't need anything (external)." It's good to want things, but you don't want to depend on them and you don't want to need them. Think of Diogenes the philosopher. "Yeah, you can move out of my sunlight."
- Happiness:
  - Temporary spikes in happiness, when you accomplish a goal.
  - Peace of mind. Freedom from negative emotions and destructive stuff.
  - Completion. The concept where one day you'll be perpetually happy. This doesn't exist.
- People attempt to chase the external and finish the completion.
