## What is Stoicism?
[Reference](https://immoderatestoic.com/what-is-stoicism/)

- Stoicism is a practical philosophy that aims to help us live well. **As Stoics, we learn to focus on what is in our power.** We ask ourselves, "What can we do to create a good life, no matter the circumstances we find ourselves in? What is required of us as human beings and what prevents us from living up to our full potential?" Consistent stoic practice increases our resilience, contentment, joy, and gives us the boldness necessary to tackle the tasks presented to us in life.
- Living naturally = taking actions that allow us to flourish. We're looking for a way to be our best possible selves. Stoicism claims that humans are rational, social beings. Our nature is to use our rational mind for the benefit of yourselves and our society.
- Stoics believe that if you are thinking clearly and acting properly, you can be joyful despite outer circumstances. One person can be content while being deathly ill, whereas another is miserable while in peak health; it's how we choose to see the world that matters. Stoics work to see the world differently. We concentrate our efforts on our own judgments and actions, the things we control, so that we know we did our best despite what fortune brings us.
- Stoic virtues: justice, wisdom, temperance, and courage.
- Discipline:
  - Assent: Be mindful of our judgments at all times.
  - Desire: Accepting our present circumstances. Don't waste effort on things that you can't control.
  - Action: Love of humanity and the world. We act for the common good.

- Ravens are considered ill omens.
- The goal which it assigns to us is to be useful, to help others, and to take care, not only of ourselves, but of everyone in general and of each one in particular. Stoicism, properly practiced, lifts people up and draws them closer together.
- Epictetus: "When you're alone you should this call this condition tranquility and freedom, and think of yourself like the gods, and when you are with many, you shouldn't call it a crowd, or trouble, or uneasiness, but **festival** and company, and contentedly accept it.
- Reframing the condition's word description is good because a festival is fun, the loudness isn't as loud or annoying.
- You can decide we're at a big party and everyone around us is in our company and then contentedly accept it.
- "It is impossible that happiness and yearning for what is not present should even be united."
- You're not going to be content and if you want it to be quiet when it isn't.

- Marcus Aurelius: "At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself; I have to go to work, as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for--the things I was brought into this world to do? Or is this is what I was created for, to huddle under the blankets and stay warm? Are we born to feel nice, instead of doing things and experiencing them?
-  *The comfort and pleasure of oversleeping isn't really enriching our lives. There's work to be done. The work of human beings. At the end of Chapter 5, the Emperor talks about people who love their work, the artist or writer who forgets to eat because their so wrapped up in their art. As Stoics we should strive to love the work of the human being, the very act of living well, as much as the starving artist loves their art. We should want to wake up.*
- Need to prepare for: dealing with traffic, dealing with a less than pleasant person, dealing with getting dragged into an hour long meeting that should have been an email.
- Premeditation: stoics quite famously take time to dwell on difficult things, the loss of a job, the death of a loved one, and their own death.
- MA: "When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own -- not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together, like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions."
- People are going to be people and that people are often less than at their best.
- Bad actions come from bad thinking, or as he puts it, "they can't tell what is good and what is evil."
- Stoics cannot e harmed by the ill actions of others, in that another's mistake can not cause us to act inappropriately.
- Others can be meddling, ungrateful, etc, but we can respond well. The only real harm is being less than our best, that is what keeps us from flourishing.
- A person cannot use another person's un-stoic actions as an excuse to act un-stoically.
- Seneca: "The wise will start each day with the thought, "Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own."" We live in the middle of things which have all been destined to die.
- In Stoicism, change is a universal constant. *To expect permanence in an ever-changing world is to court disappointment at best.*
- *We must invest our hopes not in the things that happen, but in our capacities to face them as human beings.*
- The View from Above
  - Mentally place yourself high above the earth, and ask yourself, what am I so worried about?
  - This should change our judgments on things concerning luxury, power, war, borders, and the worries of everyday life.
  - The things which do not depend on us, and which Stoics call "indifferents", are brought back to their true proportions.
  - Something about Carl Sagan.

- Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take places without something being changed?
- MA: "Nature takes substance and makes a horse. Like a sculptor with wax. And then melts it down and uses the material for a tree. Then for a person. Then for something else. Each existing only briefly. It does the container no harm to be put together, and none to be taken apart."
- For the Stoic, change is a given. And as such, it becomes unreasonable to complain about change as if it were unexpected. As the Emperor says elsewhere, "How ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life."
- E: Remember that the promise of desire is the attainment of what you desire, that of aversion is not to fall into what is avoided, and that he who falls in his desire is unfortunate, while he who falls into what he would avoid experiences misfortune.
- Therefore, it is impossible for a man who thinks he is being hurt to take pleasure in that which he thinks is hurting him, just as it is impossible to take pleasure in the hurt itself. Hence it follows that even a father is reviled by a son when he does not give his child some share in the things that seem to be good.
- We live in the middle of things which have all been destined to die.
- **We acknowledge the instability of the world so that we remember to put our energy into building up what can be stable, the only thing that can be, ourselves.**
- The Stoic seeks to be virtuous no matter the circumstances of life. Just, always. Wise, always. Tempered, always. Courageous, always. The fruit of that virtue, serenity, is equally constant. In fact, Epictetus claims that, "no feature of serenity is so characteristic as continuity and freedom from hindrance." If we don't realize and internalize that the thing we're enjoying is impermanent by the very fact that it exists, then we will be disturbed the second it changes.

- What is death, to the Stoic?
  - Death is real. It's a fact. As such, death has to be addressed. However, people can build their entire lives (entire societies) around avoiding the fact of mortality. With death as a certainty, what is to be done?
  - "It is not the things themselves that disturb people, but their judgments about those things. For example, death is nothing dreadful, or else Socrates too would have thought so, but the judgment that death is dreadful, this is the dreadful thing..." To pick up Epic's point, people understandably wail at the loss of their loved ones, but they sometimes rejoice at the death of their enemy. They grieve the loss of a child much differently then the death of their elders, particularly if the final years were painful ("it's a blessing, really"). The Stoic insistence is that we shape our reactions to death, the Stoic challenge is to reshape our judgments in a way that not only accepts, but embraces the fact that everything is mortal.
- Why should we continuously confront death?
  - Love now, be attentive now, enact justice now. "Keep before your eyes day by day...death; and then you will never have any abject thought, nor will you yearn for anything beyond measure." What better way to instill an urgency to be better than to remember every morning that we are not promised tomorrow?
- Aurelius's Stoic epithet: he doesn't aim at things he can't control.
- We are mortal. Our pasts are already gone. Our future isn't promised. This moment is what we have to work with. As Aurelius admonished, stop arguing about what a good person is and be one.
