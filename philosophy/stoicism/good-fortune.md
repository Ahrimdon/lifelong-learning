- Ravens are considered ill omens.
- The goal which it assigns to us is to be useful, to help others, and to take care, not only of ourselves, but of everyone in general and of each one in particular. Stoicism, properly practiced, lifts people up and draws them closer together.
- Epictetus: "When you're alone you should this call this condition tranquility and freedom, and think of yourself like the gods, and when you are with many, you shouldn't call it a crowd, or trouble, or uneasiness, but **festival** and company, and contentedly accept it.
- Reframing the condition's word description is good because a festival is fun, the loudness isn't as loud or annoying.
- You can decide we're at a big party and everyone around us is in our company and then contentedly accept it.
- "It is impossible that happiness and yearning for what is not present should even be united."
- You're not going to be content and if you want it to be quiet when it isn't.

- Marcus Aurelius: "At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself; I have to go to work, as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for--the things I was brought into this world to do? Or is this is what I was created for, to huddle under the blankets and stay warm? Are we born to feel nice, instead of doing things and experiencing them?
-  *The comfort and pleasure of oversleeping isn't really enriching our lives. There's work to be done. The work of human beings. At the end of Chapter 5, the Emperor talks about people who love their work, the artist or writer who forgets to eat because their so wrapped up in their art. As Stoics we should strive to love the work of the human being, the very act of living well, as much as the starving artist loves their art. We should want to wake up.*
- Need to prepare for: dealing with traffic, dealing with a less than pleasant person, dealing with getting dragged into an hour long meeting that should have been an email.
- Premeditation: stoics quite famously take time to dwell on difficult things, the loss of a job, the death of a loved one, and their own death.
- MA: "When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own -- not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together, like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions."
- People are going to be people and that people are often less than at their best.
- Bad actions come from bad thinking, or as he puts it, "they can't tell what is good and what is evil."
- Stoics cannot e harmed by the ill actions of others, in that another's mistake can not cause us to act inappropriately.
- Others can be meddling, ungrateful, etc, but we can respond well. The only real harm is being less than our best, that is what keeps us from flourishing.
- A person cannot use another person's un-stoic actions as an excuse to act un-stoically.
- Seneca: "The wise will start each day with the thought, "Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own."" We live in the middle of things which have all been destined to die.
- In Stoicism, change is a universal constant. *To expect permanence in an ever-changing world is to court disappointment at best.*
- *We must invest our hopes not in the things that happen, but in our capacities to face them as human beings.*
- The View from Above
  - Mentally place yourself high above the earth, and ask yourself, what am I so worried about?
  - This should change our judgments on things concerning luxury, power, war, borders, and the worries of everyday life.
  - The things which do not depend on us, and which Stoics call "indifferents", are brought back to their true proportions.
  - Something about Carl Sagan.
