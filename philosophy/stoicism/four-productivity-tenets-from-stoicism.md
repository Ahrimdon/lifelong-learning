[Reference](https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/four-productivity-tenets-from-stoicism/)

- Judgments should be based on actions, not words.
- We cannot rely on things outside our control to grant us happiness and serenity.
- It believes on doing, not talking.
- Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca.
- When it comes to changing behavior, we need to tweak our mindset. Productivity apps are okay, but in the long run, only a shift in mindset would sustain a positive change.

### Do Less

**"If you seek tranquility,do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential. Do less, better. Because most of what we do or say is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more tranquility. But to eliminate the necessary actions, we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well."  Marcus Aurelius, Book 4, Meditations.**

- How do big todo lists help us get deeper work done? How is that going to put us in the flow state?
- Devote your energy to the 2-3 most important tasks that are likely to give us higher returns.
- Ask yourself:
  - What's the ideal outcome if I finish this task?
  - How can I automate this task?
  - How is this task going to help me or someone else?

### Visualize the Process to the End

**"I have a relationship with other parts, so, I have no right as a whole to complain about what is assigned to me by the whole. Because what benefits the whole can’t harm the parts, and the whole does nothing that doesn't benefit it. So, by keeping in mind the whole that I’m a part of, I’ll accept whatever happens. I will do nothing selfish, but aim instead to join them, to direct my every action towards what benefits us all and avoid what doesn't. If I do that, then my life should go smoothly” Book 10, Meditations."**

- Logic can be applied to everything, including our tasks. This means breaking them down into individual steps from the start till the end.
- When we start working on something, we fail to clearly think about the process. We just start with unrealistic expectations, and this lack of clarity leads to procrastination.
- When you break down something into its individual parts, you will notice that every single step is important.

## See What's in Your Control

**"The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself with are externals, not under my control, and which have to do with the choice I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are me own." — Epictetus, Discourses, 2.5.4-5.**

- Getting upset over uncontrollable things is not only irrational, but can actually drive us insane.
- No amount of bitching about a colleague is going to make them do their job.

### Change Your Definition of Success

**"Enjoyment means doing as much of what your nature requires as you can. And you can do that anywhere. Keep in mind the ease with which logos is carried through all things. That's all you need." – Book 10, Meditations.**

- Success has variables, some in our control and some not.
- For the stoics, enjoyment meant doing their job.
- Success should be measured by the amount of effort we put towards a task. It should be the extent to which we completed our job.
- The next time you work on something, measure your performance by your effort. As long as you put your 100% into it, you've won. That's success. It doesn't matter what the external outcome is.

**Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now, take what's left and live it properly.**
