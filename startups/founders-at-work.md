## Foreword (Paul Graham)

The earliest phase is usually the most productive. That’s when they have the really big ideas. Imagine what Apple was like when 100 percent of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.

The striking thing about this phase is that it’s completely different from most people’s idea of what business is like. If you looked in people’s heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing “business,” you’d get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, PowerPoint presentations, and people producing thick reports for one another to read. Early-stage startups are the exact opposite of this. And yet they’re probably the most productive part of the whole economy.

I think there’s a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appearances to compensate. More often than not, the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse.

Business is broken the same way that car was. The effort that goes into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes organizations less productive. 

Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what passes for productivity in big companies. And yet conventional ideas of “professionalism” have such an iron grip on our minds that even startup founders are affected by them.

In fact, programming didn’t get done by well-dressed people at clean desks during office hours. It got done by badly dressed people (I was notorious for programming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn with junk at 2:00 in the morning.

## Introduction

Some kind of magic happens in startups, especially at the very beginning, but the only people there to see it are the founders. The best way to understand what happens is to ask them, so that’s what I did.

What surprised me most was how unsure the founders seemed to be that they were actually onto something big. Some of these companies got started almost by accident. The world thinks of startup founders as having some kind of superhuman confidence, but a lot of them were uncertain at first about starting a company. What they weren’t uncertain about was making something good or trying to fix something broken.

They all were determined to build things that worked. In fact, I’d say determination is the single most important quality in a startup founder. If the founders I spoke with were superhuman in any way, it was in their perseverance. That came up over and over in the interviews.

Perseverance is important because, in a startup, nothing goes according to plan. Founders live day to day with a sense of uncertainty, isolation, and some- times lack of progress. Plus, startups, by their nature, are doing new things— and when you do new things, people often reject you.

That was the second most surprising thing I learned from these interviews: how often the founders were rejected early on. By investors, journalists, established companies—they got the Heisman from everyone. People like the idea of innovation in the abstract, but when you present them with any specific innovation, they tend to reject it because it doesn’t fit with what they already know.

As Howard Aiken said, “Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.”

People think startups grow out of some brilliant initial idea like a plant from a seed. But almost all the founders I interviewed changed their ideas as they developed them. PayPal started out writing encryption software, Excite started as a database search company, and Flickr grew out of an online game.

Successful startup founders typically get rich from the process, but the ones I interviewed weren’t in it just for the money. They had a lot of pride in crafts- manship. And they wanted to change the world. That’s why most have gone on to new projects that are just as ambitious. Sure, they’re pleased to have more financial freedom, but the way they choose to use it is to keep building more things.

In its plain form, pro- ductivity looks so weird that it seems to a lot of people to be “unbusinesslike.” But if early-stage startups are unbusinesslike, then the corporate world might be more productive if it were less businesslike.

## Max Levchin Cofounder, PayPal

_PayPal went public in early 2002 and was acquired later that year by eBay for $1.5 billion. PayPal was started during the Internet Bubble, but it was in no sense a Bubble startup. Its success was a direct reflection of the intelligence of the people who built it. In large part, PayPal succeeded because it could deal with fraud—and its competitors couldn’t._

Focus in college: security. He hd founded 3 companies in college. He just wanted to write the code and recruit the coders. Peter Thiel became the CEO and he was the CTO.

Authentication devices at that time were little cards with numbers. Once he reverse-engineered them, he wrote an emulator for every card for a Palm Pilot. Then they thought of just storing money in the handheld devices.

Then we had the famous Buck’s beaming—at Buck’s restaurant in Woodside, which is sort of the home away from home for many VCs. Our first round of financing was actually transferred to us via Palm Pilot. Our VCs showed up with a $4.5 million preloaded Palm Pilot, and they beamed it to us.

At first, it ws supposed to be just a mockup, but he was so disgusted by the idea that he wanted it to work. So he coded nonstop for 5 days. At that point he knew the transaction was secure, but the Pilot's software might crash. Then they added transactions via a website. These outgrew transactions via the Palm.

They started attacking their own security, which was fine. But the fraud slowly crept. At one point there were $10M/month in fraud.

They built IGOR, a tool for detecting fraud. They had this tool which was part visualization pack- age, part graph balancing tool, that would try to represent large-scale travels of money in the system in a visual form. They used IGOR to see whether a case was fraud or not. Since fraud is so nondeterministic, you need a human or quantum computer to make a decision.

IGOR was a super secret. It was in a conference room where it was the only thing inside. It wasn't patented because Max didn't like software patents and it would become patent. So they just made it a trade secret. Some parts of it are patented, though.

Paypal is a security company pretending to be a financial services company. What PayPal does is judge the risk of a transaction and then occasionally actually take the risk on. You don’t really know the money’s good; you just sort of assess the riskiness of both parties, and you say, “I’ll be the intermediary with the understanding that, on occasion, PayPal will be on the hook for at least part of the loss if the loss occurs.” Which is very tricky; it’s a hard position to be in. You can't just super secure things (giving SSS, address, mother's maiden name) because there is a dropoff rate of 30% per step involved. So you'd be left with no users.

He couldn't sleep well for 4 years. Problems: Scaling, since growth is so fast. 20K active users per day, and these users stayed. System was built for virality from day 1. The idea was: I can send you the money, even if you aren’t a member. If I send you $10, you get an email saying, “You have $10 waiting for you. Sign up, and you can take it.” That’s the most powerful viral driver there is. Free money available to you.

For eBay buyers and sellers, it became this crazy loop where buyers would be like, “I want to pay you with PayPal,” and sellers would be like, “I don’t accept PayPal.” And buyers would say, “That’s OK. I’ll just send you $10, and you can sign up.” So the seller would get infected, and the seller would say, “Oh, this is really simple, so I only accept PayPal.”

One of the ways PayPal changed me is that I used to be really introverted, and I sort of still am, but not anywhere near to the extent that I used to be. But, you only can count on energy sources and support sources from yourself. There’s really no one else who you can go to and say, “Hey, this thing is going to fall apart any minute now. What the hell are we going to do?”

I have this IQ bias—anybody really smart, I will figure out a way to deal with. We would constantly try to come up with ones that the other person wouldn’t be able to solve. I’m really into puzzles. I’m not a very quick solver, so I tend to take a long time. Not always, but on occasion, I will take a lot longer than an average time to solve it, but I almost always will succeed.

There are different segments to running a startup. Different people taught me different things. A lot of the top management people at PayPal were really good. It was very fun and meaningful to work with them and pick up their various interests and skills.

It’s one of these things where, if you look back now, when everyone walked away with a ton of money, everyone loves everyone. The company’s not doing well; they’ve overpaid and they’ve been too nice. It’s half and half. I think I was blissfully spared a lot of it because Peter managed the board much more than I did.

What can big companies do to preserve a startup culture? Less PowerPoints. I think PayPal—even by the time we were acquired—still felt really startup in a variety of ways.

I think the hallmark of a really good entrepreneur is that you’re not really going to build one specific company. The goal—at least the way I think about entrepreneur- ship—is you realize one day that you can’t really work for anyone else. You have to start your own thing. It almost doesn’t matter what that thing is. We had six different business plan changes, and then the last one was PayPal.

If that one didn’t work out, if we still had the money and the people, obviously we would not have given up. We would have iterated on the business model and done something else. I don’t think there was ever any clarity as to who we were until we knew it was working. By then, we’d figured out our PR pitch and told everyone what we do and who we are. 

## Sabeer Bhatia Cofounder, Hotmail

_They came up with the idea of email accounts that could be accessed anonymously through a web browser. This idea became the startup. In 1996, the first web-based email was born, offering people free email accounts that could be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection. On New Year’s Eve, 1997, Microsoft acquired Hotmail for $400 million._

Two of my colleagues from Stanford had gone on to start Yahoo, and I thought, “Wow. This is just a list, a directory which tells you what is where. And somebody put $1 million in them.” So I thought, “This Internet thing is here to stay,” and I started playing around with it and came up with the idea to do a simple-to-install database at the back end. Then you’d use the browser as the front end. It could store any piece of information at the back, but the browser would be used to display it. So people could just look for it and be able to create a personal database of anything: contact information, phone numbers, special files, or whatever it is that you would do on a local PC.

No, we were actually both working, so we decided to spend all of the time on the weekends and evenings building this product. Then it came to a point that one of us had to quit our job to focus full-time on it, so I told Jack, “I’m single and don’t have a family. Why don’t you quit and start working on this and I’ll give you half of my salary?” So at least he could support his family. I did- n’t need that much money.

We went to a number of VCs and many of them turned us down because they were like, “How are you going to make money if you are going to give it away for free? What’s the revenue mechanism?” We said we would capture detailed demographic information about people and that detailed quality of information on individuals would help us advertise to them. But of course advertising was not a proven revenue model at that time.

While we were putting the business plan for JavaSoft together and were working at FirePower Systems, they installed a firewall around our corpo- rate intranet that prevented us from dialing out to our personal email accounts. I had an account at Stanford and Jack had one at AOL, so we would dial out and email each other. But we couldn’t do that anymore because the firewall pre- vented us from accessing our personal accounts. So we ended up exchanging information on floppy disks and on physical pieces of paper. That’s when it occurred to us, “Wait a minute, we can access any website in the world through a web browser. If we made email available through the web browser, that would solve our problem.”

That we could access our email from only two places: our homes and our work. And while we were at work, we could not access our per- sonal email accounts. Our plan was to use the JavaSoft idea to get money from venture capitalists. But actually the killer arrow in our quiver was always email because we thought that it was even bigger than the original idea.

etscape was building email servers. What if the VCs were just to say to them, “Hey, why don’t you do web-based email?” And that’s it, that’s the idea, right? There was not that much to protect in terms of IP. Whoever built it first
would win the market.
So we were afraid and that’s why we kept that as the secret. But we were
going to do web-based email no matter what, even if we got funding for the other idea.

We actually planned to do this. You can’t get an audience with any ven- ture capitalist without sharing a business plan, but we didn’t want our business plan floating around somewhere with the email idea. So we would go in with the JavaSoft business plan. If they passed the litmus test of not rejecting us for the wrong reasons and said, “OK, we don’t mind that you’re young, we don’t mind that you don’t have management experience,” only when they would start poking holes in the actual idea would we share the Hotmail idea with them. 

They said, “We’re going to get one of our partners to come in and take a look at this because it could be big.” We finally settled on a 15 percent split with them and they valued the company at $2 million post money. But they’d put in a right of first refusal. Since I was a young entrepreneur at the time, I didn’t under- stand that this basically meant that you couldn’t go to any other VC. It impeded our ability to go to another VC. What ended up happening was that we could not get a higher valuation because DFJ wanted to put more money in the company themselves. So any time we would talk to another VC, they would talk him out of it:

they’re a good VC firm in the sense that they try to put deals together. But sometimes they don’t play by the rules.

Nobody knows this, but the round before the deal with Microsoft, they lit- erally put $5 million in the company just because they knew it was going to get sold and that we needed some bridge money. They knew full well that we were going to get acquired; we were negotiating about the final price.

We got funded on February 14, 1996, and the site launched on the Fourth of July. We had 100,000 subscribers in the first 3 months and we were growing very rapidly from then on. We were literally getting 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 sign-ups every day. It all spread by word of mouth. We launched a massive PR campaign with a PR firm and started talking to different journalists. We did a West Coast and East Coast press tour, and it just took off from there.

You had a tagline in the body of the email encouraging email recip- ients to set up their own free Hotmail accounts. How did you come up with this? It was actually Jack’s idea to do that. We ran it by our VCs just to make sure it was OK. When you alter somebody’s email, you’ve got to be very careful. You’re sending an email to a friend of yours, and we are kind of violating the sanctity of that email by putting in a tagline at the end of it that says “This mes- sage has been sent from Hotmail. Get your free email at hotmail.com.”

How did you convince people you could make money from tar- geted advertising? It was novel, but at the same time it wasn’t novel, because Yahoo had gotten funding (and later went public) on that basis. Their whole concept was to grow by advertising, even though it was a directory, because people would pay for advertising. What has happened in the last 10 years is that advertising has grown even more. It’s not just page impressions, but the number of click-throughs. The most monetizable part of advertising (at least online advertising today) is the click-through to another advertiser, which is search. When people search, they’re most likely to click through because that’s when they’re looking for something.

It takes a long time before you can break through to an advertiser and get them to start paying you. In fact, the first 3 or 4 months we were doing advertising for our advertisers for free. We had them give us their banners, just to show that this was a mechanism for people to get their product in front of millions and millions of consumers.

Ads were perceived to be kind of a negative. And that’s the reason why, when there used to be 25 search engines, only 2 or 3 have survived. The others have died because they made their front pages look like Las Vegas casinos as opposed to preserving that sim- ple, clean interface that Google has. I think the strategy that Google took was far better. They earned the trust of the end consumer.

Did Hotmail ever become profitable from advertising? No, we didn’t become profitable. But we weren’t losing that much money. We found that we were not the best at selling ads, so we outsourced the whole thing to another company and said, “You guys go sell the ads for us. We’ll just focus on delivering these ads to you no matter how much you sell them for. hat minimum commitment they gave us, which was about $1 million per month, was alone sufficient for us to break even. Our costs were so low; we were spending about $1 million a month.

efore we launched, I think the first major turning point was getting the $300,000 in funding. That was huge for us—two young kids to get that much money. The second turning point really was when I started using it and I told my friends and family about it and everybody who used the product (50 or 100 or so people) loved it. 

Was there ever a time when you thought you were in trouble? The only time was when we had to go in for the second round of financ- ing. We didn’t have any money and Tim was at the Olympics in Atlanta and he refused to fund us because we wanted a slightly higher valuation. We had only a couple of weeks worth of money left and I would not have been able to meet the next payroll. So as soon as he came back, we literally had to accept his terms and move on. 

Who were you most nervous about from a competitive standpoint? We were most nervous about compa- nies like Netscape, because Netscape was building email servers and they would provide web-based access to the servers. Their whole point was that they provided web-based management to servers that you could set up. So, as sys- tem administrators, you could check to see how many had people signed up or whatever, but they were not offering web-based mail to people.

The good news was that a lot of people said, “I’m not sure email is a browser-based product. Email is best done on an email client like Outlook Express. It doesn’t belong in the browser.” That’s what Jerry Yang said at Yahoo. We were like, “Great!”

Talks with Microsoft started after our first anniversary, which was July 1997. In August or so, Microsoft contacted us and said, “Wow, this is really big. Do you really have 7 million subscribers?” We worked out a detailed business plan about how we would provide email to their subscribers, and then they said they wanted a tighter relationship between us and their company—that they wanted to invest in our company. So they looked at our business plan and saw very quickly that we wanted to be more than just an email company. We wanted to incorporate all of the other functions as well, such as personalized news and those kinds of things. 

They called us to meet with Bill on October 13, 1997, and we were shown the Microsoft campus, headquarters, the whole works. We were taken to Bill’s office, met with him, and then we were taken to a room with a gigantic table, and there were about 15 Microsoft negotiators sitting on the other side: business development people, lawyers, accountants, all of them. They gave a presentation about how much they liked the company and this and that, and they said they wanted to buy us and placed an offer of $160 mil- lion. I said, “Thank you very much for making an offer. We really, really like your company and like the fact that you like us so much. We’ll go back to our board and discuss this and get back to you.”

What drove you to keep on negotiating until you got the $400 million? Once you’ve got a lead in terms of a subscriber base, that is unassail- able. It can’t be replicated easily. So I knew even if they started developing the product—I have no doubt in my mind that they could have developed it, so many engineers and smart people in Microsoft. At that time they had some- thing like 16,000 engineers, and I had a total of 60 people in the company, only 14 engineers, so it would have been easy to pick 15 guys from 16,000 and build this product. But I knew we had that momentum behind us and that is very hard to replicate.

Once you have tasted this kind of success, once you’ve tasted that it works, that you’ve got subscribers who are telling you it’s good, you know you are going to get there. In fact, that’s exactly what’s happened. That 6-month lead that we had already over any of our competitors today has translated into about a 50 to 100 million–user lead. Seeing how they did a lousy job of providing email to their 2.5 million sub- scribers, I also knew that they didn’t have the technology in house. Because if they did, they wouldn’t have been asking to license this from us. 

I think I knew that Hotmail was going to become successful one day. I was just shocked that all of that happened in a span of 20 months from start to finish. Those kinds of things don’t happen very often; from the time you start to the time you see an exit in less than 2 years. 

Let me tell you one other thing about the Internet: there are thousands of such ideas under our noses even as we speak. Why things happen, I just don’t know. Maybe somebody has a need and, in our case, we had a need. That’s what triggered the idea.

The one lesson that I’ve learned in my experience while I did Hotmail and since I’ve done Hotmail is you have got to own the customer. The customers came to us for free at Hotmail. Even though they were free customers, what the last 10 to 15 years of my experience of the Internet has taught me is that it’s OK if you don’t monetize them right up front. Eventually you will be able to.

The general piece of advice, which is fairly mundane and oft repeated, is: make sure you write a business plan because it will crystallize your thoughts to communicate your ideas with somebody else. Make sure that once you have written your business plan, you have somebody read and critique it and ask you questions.

Second is, don’t try to change user behavior dramatically. For example, the reason that Hotmail succeeded was because people were accus- tomed to going to different websites. All they had to do was put in their name and password and a little bit of information and they got an email account. So in that regard, it was the ease of use of getting online and having an identity.

The other reason why Hotmail became kind of like its own phenomenal PR was every time somebody sent an email out, it was sent from @hotmail.com. That’s of huge branding value, to have that moniker in people’s email IDs. So when people would give a business card to somebody that said @hotmail.com, it perpetuated the brand.

You were a programmer. How did you learn how to write a busi- ness plan? One of the natural talents that I believe I have is the ability to communicate. A business plan is nothing more than your own communication to a person not sitting in front of you—an imaginary person who will read it. Try to answer every possible question that that person could raise. That’s the description of a business plan, really.

## Steve Wozniak Cofounder, Apple Computer

_when you meet Woz in person, you realize another equally miraculous aspect of his character. A programmer might describe it by saying he’s good in hardware._

Even back in high school I knew I could design computers with half as many chips as the companies were selling them with. I taught myself, but I had taught myself in a way that forced me to learn all sorts of trickiness. Because you try to make valuable what you’re good at. I was good at making things with very few parts by using all sorts of tricks—almost the equivalent of mathematics—so I valued products that were made with very few parts.

That helped in two ways. When you are a startup or an individual on your own, you don’t have very much money, so the fewer parts you have to buy, the better. When you design with very few parts, everything is so clean and orderly you can understand it more deeply in your head, and that causes you to have fewer bugs. You live and sleep with every little detail of the product.

hen I came home from work, I kept doing electronics anyway. I didn’t do the same calculators we were doing at work, but I got involved through other people with the earliest home pinball games, hotel movies . . .I was kind of in with Atari and they recognized me for my design talents, so they wanted to hire me.

I said, “No, I’m never going to leave Hewlett-Packard. It’s my job for life. It’s the best company because it’s so good to engineers.” It really treated us like we were a community and family, and everyone cared about everyone else. Engineers—bottom-of-the-org-chart people—could come up with the ideas that would be the next hot products for the company. Everything was open to thought, discussion, and innovation. So I would never leave Hewlett-Packard. I was going to be an engineer for life there.

Then I designed a game for Atari called Breakout, and that was a really incredible product. That was just so neat, to have my name associated with a product that actually came out in the field in video games.

I just saw somebody typ- ing away on the teletype, just talking about playing chess with a computer in Boston, and I said, “I have to do this. I just have to have this for myself.” For a lot of entrepreneurs, they see something and they say, “I have to have this,” and that will start them building their own.

I couldn’t really afford to buy the pieces I needed. I couldn’t buy a teletype, so I had to design my own terminal. The only thing that was free (because I had no money) was a home TV to see characters on. I got a keyboard for $60, which was amazingly low-priced then. That was the most expensive thing to getting my terminal built. Then it was just a matter of designing logic to put dots on a TV screen that add up to the letters of the alphabet and spell out what’s coming from another computer far away. The keyboard types the data to the computer far away, and I built a modem for that. So now I had a TV terminal. This is while I’m working at Hewlett-Packard. I’m just doing these things on the side for fun in my apartment in Cupertino.

Back in college, I had designed a neat deal called a blue box, for making free phone calls. Steve Jobs came along and said, “Let’s sell it.” So now I had this video terminal, and he said, “There’s a local time-sharing outfit that buys these expensive terminals. Why don’t we sell this to them?” So we actually sold some of the video terminals that I had built. It was to become a portion of the Apple I.

I had wanted a computer my whole life. Back in high school I told my dad, “I’m going to have a computer someday.” And he said that it cost as much as a house—the down payment on a house. And I said, “Well, I’ll live in an apart- ment.” But I was going to have a computer someday. So it starts with a huge dedication. You start with a lot of motives and values and who you are going to be in life.

Now, I still was in this mode where I had to build everything for free. Then I discovered that microprocessors had come out. I had sort of slipped out of the electronics world, out of the computer world, due to working in calculators at Hewlett-Packard. All of a sudden I discovered these microprocessors. What are they? I didn’t quite understand it fully, so I took a datasheet home.

I looked at the Altair computer that started the whole thing going. It was the first microcomputer, but it wasn’t really a computer. To me, I needed one thing. In high school, I told my dad that I was going to have a 4K Data General Nova. Why 4K? 4K bytes of memory. The reason is that’s the minimum computer to run a programming language. You’ve got to be able to program in Fortran or Basic, or some language to get your programs done. The Altair that was being sold at a ridiculously low price, all it was was a glorified microproces- sor from Intel, with some chips to protect the voltages.

My thinking was always, in making something possi- ble, you’ve got to get it down to a reasonable cost, but I needed 4K bytes of RAM minimum. The first dynamic RAMs got introduced that year, 1975—the first 4K dynamic RAMs. That was the first time ever that RAMs were lower in price than magnetic core memories, which every computer up to that day had used. So all of a sudden, the world was going to change to RAMs. Silicon was going to be our memory.

My whole life was basically trying to optimize things. You don’t just save parts, but every time you save parts you save on complexity and reliability, the amount of time it takes to understand something. And how good you can build it without errors and bugs and flaws.

I had no money. I could never build one. Chips back then were . . . like I said, to buy a computer built, it was like a down payment on a good house. So, because I could never build one, all I could do was design them on paper and try to get better and better and better. I was competing with myself. But that’s just the story of how my skill got so good. It’s because I could never build anything, I just competed with myself to come up with ideas that nobody else would come up with.

I knew that I had a lot of approaches in computers that basically no human really would use. They couldn’t even be taught in a school program. I did a lot of it in my head. Taught myself everything. We didn’t have computers in our high school even. And I was designing them.

My skill was that, if I know what I want for the end result—in those days it was a computer, in later days it might be a certain floppy disk that had to read and write some data—but if I knew what my end goal was, I know how to com- bine chips together very efficiently to get that goal done. Even if I’ve never designed anything before. My skills weren’t that I knew how to design a floppy disk, I knew how to design a printer interface, I knew how to design a modem interface; it was that, when the time came and I had to get one done, I would design my own, fresh, without knowing how other people do it.

All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a) not having money, and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every single thing that we came out with that was really great, I’d never once done that thing in my life.

 We had a guy that designed the Macintosh and he was the same way. He’d never gone to college, but, boy, he just studied circuits that had been done by others and just became that good on his own.

 I didn’t learn anything about designing computers in college.  I didn’t know anything about computer lan- guages except—a friend of mine had gone to MIT and, while he was there, he would Xerox pages out of books that were good topics, and he had sent me a lot of pages back from compiler design books. So I had actually read some com- piler design books. I hadn’t taken a course, I hadn’t had a teacher, but I had some ideas of some of the parts involved in parsing a computer language.

I  knew that I wanted a good enough computer and it meant a microproces- sor (once I discovered that a microprocessor was like those minicomputers I used to design), dynamic RAM was the choice to save money and parts, and I already had the terminal. Then I sniffed the wind and I said, “I need a lan- guage. I’ve got a 4K computer. It can run a language, but there’s no language yet for this microprocessor. So I was (a) a little bit disappointed because I wanted a computer language, but (b) I was excited and exuberant because I got to be the one to write the first language for this processor. I would get a little bit of fame out of that, and I was super shy, so the only way I could ever get noticed was if I designed great things.

In my minimalist approach, I made the wires the shortest, straightest, thinnest wires possible, instead of having these big old looped-up hairy messes of wire-wrap type stuff. So I did all that and I was also the technician. 

Steve Jobs came in saying, “Let’s start a company.” He said, “Look, there are a lot of people that want to build it and they can get the chips, but they don’t want to solder it all together. So why don’t we make a PC board and they can plop their chips in the PC board”—soldering a printed circuit board is easy, there are no wires—“and then they’ve got it done.”

So the idea was that we’d start this company and build PC boards for $20 and sell them for $40. Well, I only knew the club as a place to sell it and I thought, “Are there 50 people at the club”—I had a group gathering around me—“who are going to buy this computer instead of the Intel?” I didn’t think so, but Steve said, “Even if we don’t get our money back, at least we’ll have a company.” So it was like two good friends having a company.

How did you know Steve? That computer that was like the Altair that I’d built 5 years before— Cream Soda Computer—I’d told a friend down the block, Bill Fernandez, about it, and we agreed to solder it up in his garage. We spent about 2 weeks soldering my design together. We’d ride our bikes down to buy cream soda and come back and drink it, so we called it the Cream Soda Computer. Bill went to our high school, and he said, “There’s another guy at Homestead High School, younger than you, and he’s interested in electronics and pranks and things too and you really should meet him.” So he thought we were alike.

We both had a lot of similar experiences so we had a lot to talk about. Then we became best friends for so long. There weren’t that many people that young that knew technology. Steve and I weren’t similar personalities, which was strange, but I’m the sort of person that goes along with anyone that wants to talk technology.

The very first thought in my mind was, “I think I signed a document that everything I design belongs to Hewlett-Packard.” Even just on my own time, I thought that they deserved it first. And I wanted Hewlett-Packard to build this. I loved my division. I was going to work there for life. It was the cal- culator division; it was the right division to move into this kind of a computer.

When Steve called me one day at work and he said he got an order for $50,000—100 built computer boards for $500 each—that was high money. Now it was almost like we were big-time. We were going to sell some com- puters. Sure, we only sold 150 (maybe less) of the Apple Is, but it was a real computer and we had our name in all the magazines with charts and compar- isons. This whole industry’s springing up and there are articles about it. And no article could skip a company with a name like Apple.

Man, when I actually finally put together this little circuit and put some data into memory that should show up as color and it showed up color, it was just one of those eureka moments and you’re just shaking inside. It was just unbe- lievable. Here we had it in just a couple of chips. I had color, and then I had graphics, and then I had hi-res, and then I had paddles and sound to put games into the machine. It had dynamic memory—it had the newest right type of dynamic memory that could expand almost forever. All sorts of slots with a little mini–operating system that actually worked incredibly well. The Apple II was just one of those designs. Anybody could build things to add on to it, anybody could write programs, they could write sophisticated programs, they could write it in machine language, they could write it in my Basic. So that machine, there was just nothing stopping it.

We knew we’d sell 1,000 a month, but we couldn’t afford to build them. So we sought money, and one of the first places we went to was Commodore. To the guy who had been the product marketing manager for the 6502 micro- processor that I had chosen. That’s how we bought our first microprocessors that became the Apple I and Apple II, from this guy Chuck Peddle. He now was moving to Commodore to do a computer. We said, “We’ve got to show him the Apple II.” So we brought him by the garage. I really respected the guy; he designed the microprocessor that I had chosen. He came to the garage and looked at the Apple II, and I put it through all its specs of bringing up quick patterns on the screen and scrolling text and playing games—all the things I’d done on it. He looked at it and didn’t say too much. I figured he’d be more impressed. We later heard that Commodore turned it down.

Andre Sousan very soon after (within weeks) left Commodore and came to Apple saying that he felt we had the right product and he wanted to be with us. They just missed the boat. I think it was that Chuck Peddle knew what he could design, but he knew that he couldn’t design what the Apple II was. They should have bought it. They would have had a real good deal cheap. After that, we were still seeking money. I wasn’t really seeking the money, Steve Jobs was. I mean, I almost couldn’t have cared less. If I could show it off at the club and get credit for having a great computer design in my life, that’s what I wanted. 

Well, actually we never did much in the garage. People think we had a garage where we sat down with soldering irons and we designed stuff. No. The only designs that ever took place in the Apple I or II for hardware or soft- ware were in my apartment in Cupertino or my cubicle at Hewlett-Packard late at night. That’s the only place any building got done.

Mike was going to finance us, and then one day he said to me, “You have to leave Hewlett-Packard.” And I said, “Why? I designed two computers and cassette tape interfaces and printer interfaces and serial ports and I wrote a Basic and all this application software, I wrote demos, and I did all this moon- lighting, all in a year.”

I wanted to design computers and show them off and make software. And I can do that on my own time. I don’t need a company to do it. So there was an ultimatum day—I had to decide by a certain day if I was willing to do this. I met Mike and Steve at Mike’s cabaña at his house in Cupertino. Eventually we got around to it, and I said, “I’ve decided not to do it, here are my reasons.” Mike just said, “OK.” Steve was a little more upset.

That day my friend Allen Baum called me in the afternoon, and he said, “Look, you can start Apple and go into management and get rich, or you can start Apple and stay an engineer and get rich.” As soon as he said it was OK to do engineering, that really freed me up. My psychological block was really that I didn’t want to start a company. Because I was just afraid. In business and politics, I wasn’t going to be a real strong participant. I wasn’t going to tell other people how to do things. I wasn’t going to run things ever in my life. I was a non-political person and I was a very non-forceful person. It dated back to a lot of things that happened during the Vietnam War. But I just couldn’t run a company.

But then one person said I could be an engineer. That was all I needed to know, that “OK, I’ll start this company and I’ll just be an engineer.” To this day, I’m still on the org chart, on the bottom of the org chart—never once been any- thing but an engineer who works.

What about Ron Wayne? Steve knew Ron at Atari and liked him. Ron was a super-conservative guy. teve had 45 percent of this partnership, I had 45 percent, and Ron had 10 percent, because both of us agreed that we could trust him to resolve any dispute, and we would trust his judgment.

Do you remember any disagreements you had in the early days? Extremely minor. There were a couple, maybe. One was that we’re getting close to shipping it and we wanted things to be low-cost. Steve says, “Can we save any chips?” He’s pressing me and pressing me. I am down to like what is just amazing in the world. People to this day that understand circuitry tell me how they looked at my design and it was the most beautiful thing they ever saw. So I said, “I could cut out two chips if I skipped high-res. I don’t know if anybody’s really going to use high-res.” (It became very important actually.) And Steve said, “Oh no, if it’s only two chips, leave it in.”

When you showed people the Apple computer, were they amazed? Every single time I showed the Apple II, before we started the com- pany and even slightly after we started the company—before there was much word around about it, every single person who ever saw it . . . The engineers at Hewlett-Packard came to me and said, “That’s the best product I’ve ever seen.” And they’re around one of the greatest products of all time—the Hewlett- Packard calculator—and one of the greatest companies, and they’re saying things like that.

What is the key to excellence for an engineer? ou have to be very diligent. You have to check every little detail. You have to be so careful that you haven’t left something out. You have to think harder and deeper than you normally would. It’s hard with today’s large, huge programs. I was partly hardware and partly software, but, I’ll tell you, I wrote an awful lot of software by hand (I still have the copies that are handwritten), and all of that went into the Apple II. Every byte that went into the Apple II, it had so many different mathematical routines, graphics routines, computer languages, emulators of other machines, ways to slip your code in and out of an emulation mode. It had all these kinds of things and not one bug ever found. Not one bug in the hardware, not one bug in the software. And you just can’t find a product like that nowadays. But, you see, I had it so intense in my head, and the reason for that was largely because it was part of me. Everything in there had to be so important to me. This computer was me. And everything had to be as perfect as could be made. And I had a lot going against me because I didn’t have a com- puter to compile my code, my software.

Did you have a hard time getting everyday people to say, “Yeah, I want a computer in my office, my home”? lmost everyone who saw it wanted one, but usually the idea was, “What’s the cost?” A couple thousand bucks. “Well, I want one of those.”

Any other eureka moments in the early days? I’ve told you two major eureka moments. One was getting color to work, with this weird scheme that I had no idea if it’s going to work or not. The other was that I didn’t know if I was going to get Basic to program an arcade game, and it worked. In both those cases, I didn’t even know if it was possible and lucked out. The floppy disk was probably the third real major eureka story.

Mike Markkula wanted to get going right away on the marketing. He ran the marketing for the company. Marketing largely meant, how are you going to present the computer to be acceptable in the home? How do you move “com- puter” from a word that’s yucky and airplane cockpittish to acceptable in my home? And that had to do with different types of photography, pictures, set- tings, words to the press. He also wanted us to start getting to work on software that would apply.

He basically wanted us to write a flash card program. So Randy Wigginton and I did a flash card program called Color Math and it shipped with every Apple. We also did one called Checkbook, which would let you reconcile your checks on the computer. But here’s the problem: you had to first read the Checkbook program in off of a tape, then twiddle your thumbs for a minute and it goes “beep”; then you have to pull out another cassette tape of your own and read your checks in and it goes “beep”; then you have to do the stuff on the screen, enter some more checks and reconcile them; and then you have to put that data cassette back in and record onto it and it goes “beep.” You have all these waiting periods, and it was just too awkward and too slow. So Mike said we needed two things: a floating point Basic (that’s a Basic with decimal points, which I didn’t have) and a floppy disk.

What advice would you give to hackers who are thinking about starting a company or making something on their own?

First of all, try to have the highest of ethics and to be open and truth- ful about things, not hiding. If you have to hide something for company rea- sons, at least explain what you’re doing. Don’t mislead people. Know in your heart that you are a good person with good goals because that will carry over to your own self-confidence and your belief in your engineering abilities. Always seek excellence: make your product better than the average person would.

If you can just quickly whip something out and it’s done, maybe it’s time, once in a while, to think and think and think, “Can I make it better than it is, a little superior?” What it does is not necessarily make the product better in the end, but it brings you closer to the product and your own head understands it better. Your neurons have gone through the code you wrote, or the circuits you designed, have gone through it more times, and it’s just a little more solidly in your head, and once in a while you’ll wake up and say, “Oh my god, I just real- ized a bug that’s in there, something I hadn’t thought of.”

Lack of tools: find a way to do it. If you say, “I have to have a tool,” and you are a prima donna—”I have to have a certain development system”—if you can’t figure out a way to test something and get it working, I don’t think you’re the right type of person to be an entrepreneur.

Steve and I never really had an argument. Nobody ever saw us have an argument. The disputes were very rare and minor, of any sort between us, and they were usually just misunderstandings. 

The hardest thing was, though, after having a big success . . . see, I didn’t seek the success—I wasn’t like the entrepreneur who wants it. So the money to me didn’t really mean much. Pretty much I gave it all away to charities, to museums, to children’s groups, to everything I could. It almost was like an evil to me. That was because it wasn’t the motivation that I was after, and I wanted to remain the person that I would have been without Apple. So that’s why I went back and did the teaching. I would have done teaching were there no Apple.

## Joe Kraus Cofounder, Excite

When you got the VC money, I read that you had to think hard about how you were going to redistribute the stock. You described it as a “couch moment,” right—where you would pull the couches face-to-face to discuss dif- ficult situations? This presumes that starting a company with your friends is bad. And there are some things that are bad about it. It makes it hard to be objective about personnel decisions. “Remember, I can’t fire my friend, but I can fire my manager.”

But we would have never, ever survived as a com- pany without having something bonding us other than the pursuit of a business idea. Because we came together to start a company before even knowing what that company was doing. We were more committed to the idea of starting something together and figuring it out than a bunch of people who were only personally interested in how much money they could make or what could be built around a particular idea.

I think, quite honestly, nobody had a problem giving Graham more, because Graham was clearly the man among boys in terms of his technical ability. The other guys were smart, but they did what Graham asked them to do and Graham was the guy who really architected the whole thing.

But we ended up working through it. I don’t remember the specifics of the conversation. I remember it being very awkward and I remember it being quiet. People were unhappy. No screaming or anything like that, but awkward.

What about your first version? Did it seem like you were onto something huge? The hardest part in a startup is that you wake up one morning, and you feel great about the day, and you think, “We’re kicking ass.” And then you wake up the next morning, and you think “We’re dead.” And literally noth- ing’s changed. You haven’t made some big deal, you haven’t sold something new. Maybe you wrote a few lines of code over the course of that last day. Maybe you had some conversations with people, but nothing’s really moved.

What did people misunderstand most? Microsoft’s CTO, Nathan Myhrvold, yelling at me, “Search is not a business. People are just going to search a few times and then bookmark what they want to go to.” The second was that nobody knew what the business model was going to be. In fact, Excite really never got the business model right at all. We fell into the classic problem of how, when a new medium comes out, it adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get figured out. For example, all the television pro- gramming in its early days looked like radio. It was literally the same guys read- ing the radio program on television, and it was extraordinarily boring. And advertising was radio advertising—the announcer reading the ad.

We too adopted the business model of the prior medium, which was print. Cost per thousand impression (cpm)-based advertising was how we made money in search, and that was wrong. We never figured out the cost-per-click piece of it. We got too buried in our legacy of cpm-based advertising and that’s how we died. 

By 1997 everybody was diversifying into portal strategies, because nobody knew how to make money from search. Search was viewed as the traffic direc- tor to other more profitable businesses, when in reality, search was the business.

We were too young to realize that existing companies’ biggest problem is legacy. Period. They can’t focus on new businesses because they’ve got to manage their old ones. And so when we moved to web search, it was never clear to us that Verity, PLS, and Open Text wouldn’t actually go and do this. But they couldn’t because they were servicing all their existing busi- nesses and could never invest enough in this new kind of business.

When Microsoft made its buyout offer for Excite in late 1995, they offered about $70 million. We’d just launched in October ’95 and they’re offering $70 million. We said no, and we told them the number needed to be more like $100 million. And apparently what happened is—and I only learned this story recently—the negotiator we were working with went back to Gates and said, “I think the number’s going to be $100 million if we want to do this.” And Gates said, “How much would it cost us to do it our- selves?” So the guy went away and built a plan and said it would be about a year and $25 million and 25 people or something like this. And the interesting thing is that they didn’t buy Excite for the $100 million, and they didn’t invest and build it themselves. Instead they did nothing.

How did you get the Netscape search button deal? We needed distribution—we needed eyeballs and more people to be trying Excite. The natural point of dis- tribution was the browser. The only real point of distribution. No websites had any traffic of any size to do a deal with. It was the browser getting bundled in that made the big difference. So we went to Netscape. They had two buttons on the browser: NetSearch and NetDirectory. NetSearch was pointing to Infoseek and NetDirectory was pointing to Yahoo. And those deals were free; it was just free traffic to those services. Unbelievable. So they finally decided to put these two buttons up for bid and there were three bidders: us, Infoseek, and MCI (with a rumored new service).

We had $1 million in the bank and we didn’t know what we were going to bid. We sat down in my office, all on the floor. Vinod said we should bid $3 mil- lion. I was like, “How do we bid $3 million? We only have $1 million in the bank.” And he said, “Well, if we win, I’m pretty sure we can raise it, but if we don’t win, I don’t know how we’re going to raise it.” And so I thought, “OK, this is really scary.”

We decided to bid $3 million. We had no way to pay for it, but we weren’t going to reveal that. We bid the $3 million and we lost. Vinod told us this whole story about how he’d gone through a similar situa- tion at Sun in losing a deal, and he just never gave up and won the deal back. He said, “We haven’t lost. Let’s meet with them. Let’s show up in their lobby unannounced.” We did all this stuff; we called them constantly; we just basically acted like the bidding wasn’t over. And made a total pain in the ass of ourselves. It would have been embarrassing if it weren’t so serious.

Then luck struck: MCI couldn’t deliver its service to Netscape on time. Netscape wanted its money and they wanted to have a vendor in that slot, so they came back to us and said, “OK, we’ll take your $3 million and you can be in the NetDirectory play and good luck.” I can tell you that, had we given up, we never would have gotten the deal back. And without that deal I don’t think Excite would have had its run at all.

That was what helped launch the company. It’s so ironic. If you look at the way that a lot of huge companies get built . . . Microsoft built itself off IBM, unwittingly. Excite built itself unwittingly off Netscape. Google built itself unwittingly off Yahoo. I don’t think we would have gotten where we got without the Netscape deal and we certainly wouldn’t have gotten the Netscape deal without a really valuable lesson in persistence.

Some famous person said, “Success is 50 percent luck and 50 percent pre- paredness for that luck.” I think that’s a lot of it. It’s being ready to take advan- tage of opportunities when they arise.

The other thing that surprised me was how well companies can do if you challenge them with these big, crazy goals. When we launched in October ’95, we were number 17 in a 17-horse race. We said to the company in January ’96, “We’re number 1 or number 2 by the end of the year or we don’t matter.” We did a lot of crazy things—from acquiring companies to building new products to distribution deals. How is it realistic to say that you’ll go from 17 to 1 or 2 in a year? It’s crazy, but the company rallied around it. I’m surprised really pleas- antly by the ability of people when challenged to rise to the occasion.

Venture capitalists, with the exception of people like Don Valentine, would tell you that they’d rather fund a great team than a great idea. The reason is that if they have a bad idea, great teams can figure out a better one. Mediocre peo- ple even with a great idea can screw it up in its execution. Or if they have a bad idea, then they aren’t going to be in a position to think about how to change it.

One is hiring slowly and more carefully. Another is be cheap, cheap, cheap. Also, get the legs of the business underneath it before you run terribly fast. We were always playing catch-up at Excite and I never liked that feeling. You always felt like the traffic, the momentum, the deals were all ahead of where the business naturally was. You want to be ahead of where it naturally is, but you don’t want to be two times ahead of it. So, I think really taking the time to understand the dynamics of the business, so we can scale it, is important, along with being cheap and hiring well.

## Dan Bricklin Cofounder, Software Arts

Dan Bricklin and his friend Bob Frankston founded Software Arts in 1979 to produce VisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet. Spreadsheets used to be made on paper. When their first release shipped in October 1979, it ignited the personal computer software revolution. VisiCalc was the “killer app” for personal computers: businesses bought Apple IIs just to use it.

When I started programming, he had graduated and was running this busi- ness selling software on cassettes out of his apartment in Allston, Mass. He was looking for new stuff, like a checkbook program. I actually prototyped VisiCalc on one of his machines over one of the vacation weekends. I went to his place and wrote a prototype in Basic. Then we started discussing that they would publish it. As MBAs (both he and his partner were MBAs), they understood the value of this thing. They already had a need listed in their list of things they wanted of financial stuff. And they were looking at other financial forecasting tools, but this also would do checkbooks and other stuff. So they knew they could sell it as that; they knew that they would use it. And we made a deal to produce it.

No, I had been thinking of the idea; I had daydreamed about it. I had actually done a prototype on Harvard’s computer system that was available to us as students. As part of the prototyping, I came up with what we have today: the A-B-C 1-2-3 type of thing, the columns and rows ways of indicating things; the idea of having a formula on what we call the contents line that tells you what you’re pointing to; moving around where you could move the highlight around from cell to cell—that whole thing. The idea and some of the prototyping had been done. The actual trying it on a personal computer was written in Basic to see what it would feel like. And then we actually programmed it in assembly language starting the winter of ’78/’79.

I had originally wanted the thing to use a mouse. There was no mouse on the Apple II at the time, so I was using the game paddle and turning it. But the way I was doing it with the game paddles, the cursor was just too unstable. So I switched to the arrow keys, which were much more discrete.

I learned some computer things. I had it make a sound every time it recal- culated a cell, but it turned out that the making of the sound on the Apple used up three-quarters of the CPU time, because it did it with a timing loop. People who saw it, who needed it, got it. Sorry, no—some of the people who needed it got it. You have to be a person who is able to look at a general- purpose tool and be able to think, “How would I use that to solve my problem?” Most people are not that way. They look for a tool that is being used already for something close to their problem and then understand what it is. Many people who saw the spreadsheet with an example, if the example wasn’t in their field, they couldn’t make the leap. Because they’re not programmers in their mind.

But, if you showed it to somebody where it clicked, either because they understood the general-purpose nature and could apply it to their own needs, or you showed them an example, like financial forecasting or something that they did, and they knew the other tools in the world, they got very excited. If you showed it to a computer person who didn’t have those needs, they’d say, “That’s kind of cool, but what’s so special about that? I could just do it in Basic.” Now, there were those that hadn’t seen as interactive a computer before, weren’t as aware of word processing and some of the other things, and, when they saw it, it really opened up their minds to what you could do interactively with computers.

Who were the very first users? There was Al Sneider, locally, who was at Laventhol & Horwath, which is an accounting firm, and he started pushing them to use personal com- puters. They did a lot of accounting for the gaming business. They actually used VisiCalc to figure out how to lay out a casino and where to put which slot machines, I’m told. There were doctors who had bought personal computers because they thought it would be kind of cool, who used it for, I think, anesthe- siology calculations in open-heart surgery.

Hewlett-Packard got it. One of my classmates from Harvard Business School worked in the group that was developing a personal computer there, and they read Ben Rosen’s write-up, and Hewlett-Packard licensed it and did their own implementation based on our software.

What were the biggest conceptual hurdles for you as you were building the product? So I had this idea, this general two-dimensional layout, and I had the idea of calculating and then recalculating, because it’s like word wrap; it does that. So those ideas came up right away for me. But then how do I really express that? What exactly are the keystrokes that you do? What exactly is the metaphor? How do I make it easy to learn? 

The challenge was, how do you express the value you’re typing in, the for- mula you want to calculate, its location, and the precision of the decimal points, and how wide are the columns and all this stuff? Is it an integer, is it a floating point number? How do you specify all that? In computerdom in those days, that was the most yicky stuff of any computer language—the format statement in Fortran, and COBOL’s pictures and all that. It was just such a mess. How do you get the output specification of how it looks?

I ended up with WYSIWYG, like people had done in typesetting. How do you marry that with calculating? There I came up with use of the grid as a way to be able to name things. The big problem for me was, how do you name things? How do you name the value? In the old days, it’s like, variable name equals expression, right? That’s how computers work. Well, this was, “What’s the variable name going to be?”

Today it seems so natural: you use A1. Well, first of all, it was A1, not 1 comma 1. It is too many keystrokes, it’s not normal for people, and there’s a whole lot of problems with it. By going to the map coordinate type of thing— A1, G7, or something like that—that was something I knew regular people would understand. But it also parsed well: anything that starts with a letter was obviously a variable name, because numbers always start with a number, or a plus and a minus or something. So it made it really easy to make it obvious what you were typing in. So, if you said 1 + A1, I knew exactly what it was. But, if I said 1 + 1,1?

We had very little memory space to give you in the way of help, but if you hit /, it listed all the letters you could type. If you typed a letter, it would give you the name of the command that you were doing and any options. So basically, it was always prompting you with what you could do next, once you learned to do the / key. And, of course, we could use /, because / is an infix operator, not a prefix operator, so you always knew that if something started with a /, it had to be a command. But, if it started with a +, it’s going to be a number. So it was one of the few characters around that was good for that. And it was not shifted (I hate holding control keys down), and computers had used / as commands before, so it was a natural thing to use, for me.

When 1-2-3 came out, those were the things people asked. “Does it have commas in numbers? And dollar signs before the numbers?” I think we had dollar format, which meant .00. But did it do commas, did it have variable col- umn widths, and did it have the long labels? I remember Vern Raburn telling me those were three of the main questions that he was asked, and then people said, “Fine, I’ll buy it.” So those were features we didn’t have that would have been nice if we did. We knew we needed those, but there was just a limit to what we could get done and would actually fit and work in the original product.

We worked out of Bob’s attic until around when we got delivery of this computer that we bought, a time-sharing computer. Bob wrote an assembler and linker for it, and I wrote an editor for it so that we could do our work. We hired an employee or two, and they helped us finish the actual product and then convert it to other machines.

Bob wrote most of the code, and then this person we hired, Steve Lawrence, and myself wrote the rest of the code. I got the transcendental func- tions to work, the sine and cosine, stuff like that. There were bugs in divide, and Steve got those things working. We had the beta version of it ready, I think, in the late summer, together with a self-running demo version of it that was actu- ally macro-driven—that basically had a long macro that would just run that was just keystrokes driving the thing.

There were panic moments in the business, but they had nothing to do with programming. We were working in a basement in Central Square. We were next to the T (the subway) right near the Kendall Square Station. The T went right by us, and every time it went by, everything would shake, because, literally, it was a few feet in front of us.

We were below street level, so, when it rained, the toilets would back up. When it rained, whenever you left the building, you had to remember to turn off the toilet, or else they would back up. We missed one, and it started flood- ing, and the water started pouring toward our computer. I have some pictures of me there with one of those wet vacs as the water just missed our computer! Our life savings are in this one computer—life savings plus some money from relatives, plus personal guarantees on the loan.

I wrote an accounting system. Not only did I write the editor, I wrote an accounting system for us, and I did all the bookkeeping. I mean, here I am, a business school student taught to do accounting by a wonderful professor of accounting and then taught cost accounting by Jim Cash, who’s now on the Board of Microsoft, but I’m now trying to figure out doing debits and credits by hand. I didn’t know what the real world had on that. And I was doing my own bookkeeping. I wrote a system to do it.

Do you remember when you finally thought, “OK, this is a big deal?”  It felt like a really big deal when I started having people I didn’t know in the regular part of the world knowing about spreadsheets and taking them for granted. When the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial about the budget in Washington and said, “Yellow ledger pads and VisiCalc spreadsheets all over Washington are trying to figure this out,” that really hit me.

IBM came to us wanting VisiCalc on the IBM PC, and when they ran the advertisements on TV, they showed VisiCalc (or they showed what they said was VisiCalc; it was a mockup that they did) with Charlie Chaplin pushing a button. When Apple ran an ad, they had Dick Cavett—who had never done ads on TV before—and he would push a button and up would come VisiCalc on the screen. Now, here’s EDS, that has infinite computing power available, with any software of the big financial forecasting systems, and all that, and they’re using VisiCalc to price multi-million-dollar deals! I found out that investment bankers who were doing real deals were using it. When the people you looked up to as the pros have switched to your stuff, that meant something.

Stay out of lawsuits if you can help it. It’s bad for both sides, especially small businesses. That’s lawyers’ business, to them, solving things through law- suits. But it’s very, very expensive. It’s a sport of kings, and it uses up a lot of time. Unless you’re a very big business that can make it a very small part of what you do, it’s much better to find other ways to solve things. Frequently, individu- als can do it better face to face. People who are the heads of companies under- stand that.

What I do realize is there are advantages to selling at a peak. You don’t know when the peak is. I know people who sold their businesses when everybody thought you were crazy. “The business is going through the roof; why are you selling now?” And in hindsight, of course, it turned around. Six months, a year later, the business started crashing. They didn’t get the peak, but they came pretty close.

There are some people to whom it’s worth taking the risk, because you risk going for the big one, and, in a portfolio, that’s good. But as they say on Wall Street, the bulls make money, the bears make money, but the pigs get slaugh- tered. In other words, don’t be greedy. Whether you think things are going up or things are going down, you can make money going both ways. But, if you are piggish, are greedy, that’s when you have problems; you’ll be irrational about that.

A lot of people make money because they’re very good at timing. We were close. If we hadn’t been sued, I would have done pretty well financially, because Bob and I owned most of the company at the time. And we would have had an interesting next step, going into what was probably the leading online business at the time. Maybe it would have ended up into the Internet or something, or it would have made the jump better. Who knows? But it didn’t happen.

Yeah, it was out of our hands. If we had been able to settle in advance, the thing would have closed, and we would have made a lot of money, and we’d have a bigger house, and whatever. But, you know, as I always tell people, here it is, 25 years later, and you’re still interviewing me. There’s fame and fortune. I didn’t get much fortune out of it, but, on the other hand, the fame has basically given me a meal ticket ever since, and I learned a lot from it, and the rest of my life has been pretty good. All in all, I can’t complain. I did a lot better than I ever expected to, in all sorts of ways. So there are no regrets about that. I mean, each thing, you think, “Well, if I had put this feature in, it would have been better.”

At the last minute, when the company was about to go under, we found some people who were willing to buy the company, but they wanted me to spend a year working for them, and I was not happy about this at all. I ran into Mitch Kapor on an airplane, and we talked. That’s Monday. Friday night, Lotus bought our company—they bought the assets of the company. So finally we sold the company, and I’m out, with no strings attached. That was great. And then we have to finally sell off all our stuff, because they did an asset deal. So people had to stay on to close down the company and all the liabilities for a year or two; it was a mess.

## Mitchell Kapor Cofounder, Lotus Development

Mitch Kapor founded Lotus Development with Jonathan Sachs in 1982. Their spreadsheet software, Lotus 1-2-3, quickly surpassed VisiCalc to become the new industry standard. isiCalc had been the original “killer app” for personal computers. Kapor was a VisiCalc product manager at Personal Software when he wrote VisiPlot and VisiTrend, companion products to VisiCalc. He left to found Lotus just as legal conflicts were distracting VisiCalc’s developers, and the arrival of the IBM PC opened a window of opportunity for a better spreadsheet. Lotus 1-2-3 could handle
larger spreadsheets and added integrated charting, plotting, and database capabilities. It became the killer app killer. 

How did Lotus get started? I thought I was just going to clean up this little product over Christmas break so I could finish my education. I would make some money and that would be that. And I only thought that because I was totally ignorant about how long things took. I had no background in computer science. I was self-taught—I was still writing in Basic. I had no management experience; I was in business school at the time. In fact, I had spent my years after college as a radio disk jockey on a progressive rock station. I was a transcendental meditation teacher, and a mental health counselor at a psychiatric unit of a community hospital. That was OK, because there wasn’t really a personal computer software industry. It was still kind of a hobby thing becoming a business, and nobody really took this stuff seriously, so I wasn’t ludicrously unqualified by the standards of the day.

But I was wrong about how long it was going to take to do this thing. I was inspired to want to do a really great job by VisiCalc, which was so much better than anything I could ever write. But I said, “I want to try to do something that could stand up well.” And I faced a difficult decision because school was start- ing again. I took a leave of absence from school to finish the product.

I didn’t know what done was with software. I had, roughly speaking, an alpha version of the product—it had some demonstrable features. I decided that I needed to totally rewrite Tiny Troll to be much better, and give it a totally new user interface, and so on. Based on that misunderstanding of what done was, I said to the publisher, “What I want to do is to come out to California”— which was where they were—“and you should hire me to be your new product manager. I can finish this thing in my spare time. It’s almost done.”

So here’s the way the world looked to me at the time: I have a hit product— not a number one product, but it’s making money. And it has an insupportably high royalty rate. I no longer work for the publisher, but I know how they think and I’m uncomfortable with them. And I know they don’t want to work with me. So I felt what I should do is to have them buy me out. They would get con- trol of the code, close out the royalty stream, and I would go do whatever I was going to go do next. I saw that was in everybody’s interest. And that’s in fact what happened. They bought us out for $1,200,000, so I made a whole bunch of money. I had never made more than $14,000 a year—I told you what kinds of jobs I had. We had taxes to pay and I had a partner to take care of, but I wound up with $600,000, which I divided into two piles.

The galvanizing event was when IBM announced the IBM PC in August 1981. It was very important in the history of PCs because it legitimized the whole field—because of IBM’s imprimatur. Until then, the personal computer hardware companies were Apple, Tandy, and Commodore. IBM was the first “real” computer company to come out with a PC, legitimizing it for the business marketplace. And that was not lost on me.

So we decided to bet on doing something for the IBM PC, which proved to be one of the reasons why we were successful. They had decided to outsource a lot of the key elements of what they were doing, right to the distribution. Rather than selling it just through their own sales force, they were selling it through retail stores like Computer-Land and Sears, which at the time was a very radical idea. They had gone to Intel for the microprocessor; they had gone to Microsoft for the principal operating system. And I said, “They’re smart. They realize they don’t understand this business, so they’ll go to the best people. They’re not going to have a lot of ego, and this is the way things are going to work.”

The Apple II had 64K—not megabytes, kilobytes—of memory. It was tiny. And not all of that was available. Actually, if you wrote programs on the Apple II, you started with a 48K memory space. So the programs were tiny and the user data was tiny and people were building spreadsheets that exceeded memory. It was a fundamental limit of the Apple II, because it was an 8-bit microprocessor. IBM used a 16-bit microprocessor and I said, “Ah, this will permit people to build bigger spreadsheets.” The memory space of the IBM PC when it came out was 640K, 10 times the size. So I said, “16-bit, faster proces- sor, more memory says IBM. We should target it. We should build a product that is optimized for it.”

Yes, I think the one-button graphing in particular, and the speed of the calculation. VisiCalc users loved VisiCalc; they just wanted it to do more. And it didn’t. And when we showed that this did it right out of the box, they went, “I get it.” I used to get applause doing demos all the time.

Because they were writing for an 8-bit machine, and they didn’t take advantage of the 16-bit architecture in a whole variety of different respects. We just had more optimized code. And we had a different recalculation algorithm. We were the first spreadsheet to do something called “natural order of recalcu- lation.” If your spreadsheet had forward references in it, VisiCalc would take multiple passes over the whole thing to calculate stuff, but we did one pass through the entire formula chain, and as long as there weren’t circular refer- ences, it would calculate properly. So it was much faster for certain cases.

And Sachs was also very, very good. He was just an artist at high performance with limited resources. I didn’t know how good he was; I got lucky. I knew he was good, but he was a genius at this sort of stuff. The two of us together was essentially 1 + 1 = 3, because I had a vision about the product and very strong ideas about the fea- ture set and the user interface, and he was generally willing to let me drive things at that level. He had the responsibility for the technical architecture and implementation, but I’m actually quite technical, so I was able to talk with him to fully understand a number of the issues and limitations and modify the design in a way that was consistent with what we could actually do. So we had a critical mass of knowledge between the two of us that neither of us had alone.

ost of my mistakes came after we launched the product, not before—after we started shipping in January of ’83. I had no significant experience in building an organization or building a management team. And I intuitively did well when I was leading the whole team, but once we got past 25 people, you can’t do that. And so I made a series of classic mistakes in hiring. And not building a good middle management structure. And not recruiting a board that could help me build the company.

I did not set out to build a big company. I actually wanted to be a software designer. I saw having a company not exactly as being a necessary evil, but there wasn’t a good alternative. My experience had convinced me that being a pro- gram author and having somebody else publish it wouldn’t give me enough con- trol over the process. In Hollywood, the very successful directors like Steven Spielberg quickly understood that they also needed to be producers and have their own studio in order to retain control. It was a similar thing.

I was interested in really cool products, so I guess that’s where that came in. I had a very unconventional background and really no interest in building a button-down business culture. And I’m not an engineering geek, either. These types of companies tend to reflect the personalities and interests of their founders. Microsoft is very much cast in Bill Gates’s image; and Apple, Steve Jobs; Borland, Philippe Kahn. And so we tended to have more creativity and innovation.

The other thing that I cared about a lot right from the very beginning was creating a workplace that treated people well. At Software Arts, they felt I had attitude problems. I didn’t respect authority. I basically thought, “The people that are running this are stupid and they don’t listen to me and I don’t like being here, being told what to do.” It was a mixture of keen insight and adolescent emotions that I carried for a very long time. So when I unexpectedly found myself running this high-growth successful software company, the thought of making it be the kind of place that I would want to work at and different from all those other places was incredibly appealing.

What advice do you give to people who want to start startups? It depends on what type of advice they want. You can’t tell people what they don’t want to hear because they won’t care and it’s just a waste of breath. And everyone comes in with some kind of agenda.

I like working with entrepreneurs who have a compatible set of values and are inspired by a vision and are passionate about some piece of disruptive tech- nology—who are going to create something that actually has value for people in a way that can be a game changer. That’s sort of my sweet spot. But every proj- ect is different, so the specific advice needs to be customized.

The most important thing for me is, I don’t want to work with someone who says, “Just help me make the business be more successful.” I want to work with entrepreneurs who are personally passionate, committed, and believe in what they’re doing. Not all entrepreneurs are like that. Some people may be just as happy selling canned tuna—“Just show me an opportunity where I can make money and I’m going to go do that.” You think Mark Cuban really cared about what they were doing at Broadcast.com? This is not to criticize him as a busi- nessman—I’m just observing—but I don’t think he had a fundamental passion about that business. There was an opportunity, he saw it, he built something, he sold, and he cashed out at the right time.

When you were developing Lotus 1-2-3, you always had working code. Wasn’t that type of incremental development very much ahead of its time?

Yes. I think Sachs and I saw it the same way. We figured out a number of things very early on that became conventional wisdom. I’m not sure that we were that much smarter than anyone else. But we had the requisite smarts and we were in the right place at the right time. So this developing close to the tar- get machine and having code running, it seemed obvious once you looked at it that there were enormous benefits to it. The reason it wasn’t obvious is that the machines were barely powerful enough to do development on.

And always having something running was a Sachs thing, because it was just his experience it was a good thing, and I saw it and said, “Yes indeedy, we should do this,” long before extreme programming.

What would you tell an entrepreneur to understand before he/she meets with a VC?

I try to explain how it works. There are more choices nowadays for people—angel money, for example. And many things are much less expensive to do now. You can go further on your credit card than you could before. I want entrepreneurs to make informed choices when it comes to financing. Under- stand what the impacts and implications are for different financing options.

## Ray Ozzie Founder, Iris Associates, Groove Networks

_At the University of Illinois, Ray Ozzie worked on PLATO Notes, one of the earliest collaboration applications. After he led the development of Lotus Symphony, Mitch Kapor and Jonathan Sachs decided to invest in Ozzie’s idea, which would become Lotus Notes. Instead of working as an employee, Ozzie founded Iris Associates in 1984 to develop the product for Lotus. Lotus Notes was the first widely used collabora- tion software. The first release shipped in 1989, and
Iris was acquired by Lotus in 1994. In 1997, Ozzie founded Groove Networks, which built Internet-based work-
group collaboration software. Microsoft acquired Groove in 2005 and named Ozzie chief technical officer. In June 2006, he took over as chief software archi- tect from Bill Gates._

When we first started Groove in the fall of ’97, we worked out of my house. Initially, it was my brother Jack, Eric Patey, and Brian Lambert. A few weeks later, we moved to an office space at the Cummings Center in Beverly, Massachusetts. A couple months into the project, another former Iris engineer, Ken Moore, joined our team. The first thing we coded was a primitive version of our synchronization algorithm.

The common theme to both Iris and Groove was the fact that the ideas were not based on technology, but on a need I saw for users or potential cus- tomers for the product. I’m an engineer by training and I tend to be one of these people who believes he can accomplish basically anything in software— it’s just a big toolbox. So if you know that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to, what’s worth accomplishing?

With Groove, it was an observation that the nature of work was changing. Technology at that point had largely been applied to helping people work together within corporate boundaries. People were increasingly going to be challenged trying to apply that same technology across boundaries, because you can’t control the technology chosen by your business partners. I might choose Notes, you might choose Exchange, the other person might choose someone else.

We saw a lot of frustration when our customers tried to deploy systems across enterprises. So we came to the conclusion that what we really needed was to build a system that just worked instantly, right after download, for the end users.

Before I start a company, I typically write a couple of founding docu- ments. One of them is very outside-in: it’s a scenario-based document, describ- ing the high-level challenge that I’m trying to address and the end user scenarios that we are trying to solve. This attempts to explain what we’re trying to accomplish to anyone who joins the company or we might need to get financ- ing from.

Then I create a second, bottom-up document describing the different tech- nologies that will have to be assembled to accomplish that vision.

The first thing we did in both Iris and Groove was get a big open office and recruit a core team of people. Generally these were people I’d worked with before, so I wouldn’t have to get past the trust issue involved in understanding what they are good at and what they’re not.

And we’d just sit down with the whiteboards and just try to work through some of the more difficult algorithms, make key tooling decisions. Early on in Groove, we had a very big decision to make: do we do it in C++ or do we do it in Java? These types of decisions are important because you can never go back on them once you’ve started down that path.

In Groove’s case, there was a very risky piece of technology—a certain algo- rithm for synchronization that we didn’t even know if we could do. And we did- n’t want to hire more people and really get going until we knew we could accomplish it. It took about 3 to 4 months before we were confident that we’d be able to actually build what we wanted to.

It had been done for years in a variety of settings—especially in an aca- demic setting. But the commercial PC environment is a very harsh one. People reboot PCs, they restore them from backups, they lose them. It has to be very resilient. We wanted to make sure the algorithms we were using would scale to what we needed.

The thing that’s not really characteristic, that doesn’t really translate from both of my startups to what other entrepreneurs do, is that I think of the challenges I take on as 10-year challenges, not filling a quick market niche. There tends to be some time where I’m building up a level of technological advantage for when we get to market. With technology, there’s no such thing as a sustainable advantage, but you can get a good running start if you concentrate on doing something hard really well.

Some people cope with uncertainty by being really comfortable in their own little box. Some developers, for example, will divide the problem and divide the problem until they only have to work on this little piece of the database or this little piece of the communications, and they just don’t worry about the stuff above that. They leave that to people like me to deal with, in terms of the risk and continuing to be on the right path. To be on that long of a time frame, you have to be able to change as the market changes.

In a startup, you’re on this mission together. Everyone has to feel that, and you have to hire people who are willing to believe in something they are trying to accomplish. And in that era, it was very challenging in two dimensions. Hiring in the dot-com era, when a lot of these people’s friends were getting rich, was hard. But the other thing was that the type of software we were build- ing had many systems software elements to it. A lot of it was lower-level com- munications, storage, application framework–type code, and hiring was more difficult for that type of talent at that time. In an earlier era when DEC was big, it was easier to hire systems software talent.

But what held people together was the belief that you’re really going to change the world. I think that’s the nature of many startups. You believe that what you are doing is going to have a dramatic impact. You might not exactly know how, but you really have a belief. That keeps you going and going through many changes and a lot of uncertainty.

But eventually I took some money from Mitch Kapor and then others. Not so much because I needed it at that point, but because I knew that, ultimately, you cannot accomplish some- thing completely on your own. You really need to develop a network of people who win when you win. Being on the East Coast, I believed that it was very important to establish a good network in Silicon Valley, where I didn’t have a presence.

In a startup environment, it’s much rougher in terms of making your num- bers. There’s much less patience. Once you start down the treadmill of taking venture capital, it’s “how many rounds before people give up on you or you have a positive exit event?” So you’re really setting yourself up. The best by far is to structure it such that you don’t have to take money.

If there’s going to be a trend that’s largely horizontal, Microsoft cares. Because Microsoft’s bread and butter is serving the masses—whether it’s con- sumers or enterprises—with low-cost technology that solves many problems. And other people layer upon it more vertical solutions. We were pitching Groove as a fairly horizontal technology. We were apply- ing it to productivity challenges, but to the extent that it had the potential to catch on broadly, they would certainly have been the biggest competitor.

If you believe that Microsoft is your competitor, it’s better to keep stealth and then embrace them at the right time, when you believe it can be to your advantage to embrace them. In the case of Groove, we were having distri- bution challenges, we needed money, we were raising a round. One of the biggest questions we were encountering with our enterprise customers was “Why isn’t Microsoft just going to crush you tomorrow?”

I guess as a tech entrepreneur I would nurture relationships with people who are outside your skill set on the marketing and sales side or business devel- opment side. Relationships you know you can trust. As a technologist, it’s very difficult to hire someone on the marketing and sales side because they’re so dif- ferent than technologists and you don’t know who to trust. It takes about a year to really understand whether the people who you are partnering with trust you and know they will rely upon you just as much as you know you will rely upon them.

That’s where I think working for another company and building those rela- tionships is extremely valuable. Frequently, people think just running from school out into doing a startup is the best thing to do. But I think that getting some experience within a number of companies is really positive because you meet people and you start to develop patterns in your mind of the types of peo- ple that you need, and the types of people that you can trust, and the types of people you never want to work with.

For someone who’s joining a startup, just learn about leadership from the people at the top of the company. Watch how they talk to people, watch how they present to people. Companies take their shape based on the personal- ity characteristics and human interaction characteristics of the founders. This is true in every company. Learn about the kind of culture that you want to create in your own company based on the positive and negative aspects that you wit- ness in the people that are your leaders.

Learn to respect and appreciate other people’s skill sets, because you are going to need other people if you do start a company and you are a technologist. Understand that it’s a rare, rare case when a tech entrepreneur is the right one to lead a startup for a long period of time. You have to feel comfortable in your own skin in terms of what you’re good at and what other people are good at. Know when the shift to chief technologist is the right thing for the company.

veryone knows that one reason you go to work and do what you do is the hope that ultimately you’ll be compensated. But you don’t have to say it, and it doesn’t have to come through. It should be about the mission. It should be about changing the world. It should be about how you can impact the lives of users, partners, and the employees themselves. It’s not just about this big pay- day. The more you focus on the things that matter when you are talking to peo- ple who want to believe in you, the more they will believe in you and the more it will be a sustainable entity.

## Evan Williams Cofounder, Pyra Labs (Blogger.com)

_Evan Williams cofounded Pyra Labs in 1999. Origi- nally, Pyra intended to build a web-based project management tool. Williams developed Blogger to manage his personal weblog, and it quickly became an important mechanism for sharing ideas internally at Pyra. Once launched publicly, Blogger grew rapidly, and Pyra Labs decided to focus on it full-time. But Blogger.com did not generate a lot of revenue at first, and as the Bubble deflated in 2001, Pyra seemed near death. Williams remained as the only employee and
managed to bring the company back from the brink. By 2003, Blogger had one million registered users. That attracted the attention of Google, who made Pyra their first acquisition. Williams left Google in 2004 to cofound a podcasting company called Odeo._

I had never even really worked anywhere. I was just totally self-taught tech- nically, but I started a company and kind of ran it into the ground over 3 years or so, and it was a very educational, painful experience. But I knew I was going to do that again. I just always knew I was going to start my own thing.

I moved to California to take a job with O’Reilly, which ended up being very fortunate as you’ll find out later. I worked there for a few months, though I knew I didn’t want to work for anyone. I taught myself web development—this was in the middle of the boom and there was lots of work to be had as a con- tractor. I knew I was going to start another company. I just wasn’t ready yet. So I was a web developer on contract for about a year and a half, and worked in various companies like Intel and HP. Finally I got to the point where I said, “OK, I am going to start another company.” This was very much in the middle of the boom.

Around the time I was thinking about starting the company, I was talking to a friend of mine, Meg Hourihan. She got excited about the idea and said, “Hey, let me start it with you.” She had been a management consultant and was really smart, so I said OK. I had been contracting, so I had a little bit of money, so I could coast for a little while, but we didn’t know anybody. We weren’t hooked into the startup scene.

Everyone was getting funded, but it is still completely just a network. You have to know the right people. Whether it’s good times or bad, you have to know people and you have to talk their language, and we were just from a dif- ferent place and not hooked into that at all. So we just said, “OK, here is the product we are going to build,” and we started building it. We actually kept con- tracting on the side—I had a contract with HP. That’s how we paid the bills— we turned my personal contract into the company’s contract and we did a little work on that and we did a little work on our project, and that is how we started.

The first year was entirely self-funded. It was just doing this work mostly for HP. HP basically funded Pyra for the first year, unbeknownst to them, because at the time you could charge a decent amount of money for doing pretty simple web application development. If one of us was working on that full-time, it would pay for three of us (not that we were paying ourselves much). We started working on things in November ’98. We technically started the company in January. Meg started full-time in February, and we hired our first employee, Paul Bausch, in May. Then we got an office down here in SOMA.

It was easy, and that was a key thing for me because I wasn’t lacking the knowledge about how to publish to the Web . . . For a long time, people understood Blogger as “It makes it easy to have a website.” But a lot of things before that made it easy to have a website. GeoCities made it easy to have a website, but they didn’t make it easy to publish anything on an ongoing basis. So, for me, the idea that I could have a thought and I could type in a form and it would be on my website in a matter of seconds completely transformed the experience. It was one of those things that, by automating the process, com- pletely morphed what it was I was doing. If I could have a thought and then put it on my site, then obviously I am going to potentially do that much more and it is a stream for communication of a whole different type.

We took the script I wrote to publish my site, and we made an internal site where we could do the same thing. So, even when it was only Meg and I, we had this little internal blog we called “Stuff,” and we just put stuff in there. It was a blog, but it was just, “Here’s a thing from a competitor or a potentially useful page or just information for each other.” It was a place where we col- lected everything and, as we grew, it was the center of Pyra. It was where things happened.

So this whole time we are building our real collaboration tool, with all kinds of structure and big ideas trying to be implemented into it, but we were really using Stuff a lot. And then Paul wrote a little addition to Stuff so that certain things we posted to our internal blog we could put on our external company blog.

We were one of the first companies to have a blog on their site—not that many people were reading. But it was neat. We were publishing news, random things we liked, whatever.

That’s when I got the idea for Blogger—I know because I registered the domain then. I totally pictured what it was because it was based on what I was already doing and then the way we were publishing our own blog to an external site. I said, “Let’s turn that into a product.” I have always been a prod- uct guy and am just always thinking about products and thought this would be a cool little idea.

While it did seem fairly easy to build, it was a dilemma, because one of the big lessons from my first company was to focus. After my first company died, I did an inventory of the projects I had worked on in the last year. There were something like 30 projects that I had started on and not finished. My total weakness was not focusing on things. So I had this idea and I loved it, but very clearly we were only three people and we had to contract to pay the bills and we couldn’t start another product. We had this big thing we were trying to do. So it just kind of sat in the back of my head, but it wouldn’t go away. It kept bugging me. Of course, what made me still think about it was that we were using it for our own purposes and we were building this collaboration tool, but we were doing this kind of collaboration with Stuff. We actually said several times, “Maybe Stuff should just be our product?” And we agreed, “That’s too simple, that is too trivial.” And also we didn’t have the resources for two products. So that went on for a long time, and it was in July, I guess, when we finally launched Pyra, the app, and that actually got a pretty good, if limited, reception.

People started using Pyra and it was in evolving it that I came up with the justification for why to do Blogger. That was based on the idea that we were trying to solve a really, really big problem, which is organizing people’s informa- tion of all types. We said, “That is too big a problem to start with, so we should focus it.” We decided to focus it on people who were building websites, as a place for them to collaborate. Then we thought up this architecture where there would be little mini-apps, and Blogger would be one of those. So, with that justification (Meg was actually on vacation for a week), Paul and I built Blogger and launched it while she was gone. Which was a terrible thing to do, but ultimately a good thing to do—but not a cool thing to do.

It caught on a lot more than we expected. It was really designed to appeal to web geeks. It wasn’t a mass consumer product. It was, “If you’re a web geek like us, you might find this interesting.” It’s good to appeal to the alpha geeks sometimes. I thought it would be pretty cool if 1,000 people used Blogger. It didn’t explode at first because it was fairly technical. You had to have a website and you had to know what FTP was. You had to know a bunch of stuff, but things that you would know if you were a web geek. We put it out there and people started using it and the existing weblogs started pointing to it. Like Peter Merholz (he is credited with coining the term blog), who pointed to it. It started getting traction and a lot of people who were like the “cool kids” were using our product, and we were really excited.

We launched it in August and we had a dilemma on our hands right away, of course, because we now had a product that people were using, but it wasn’t the “real” product.

The problem was, we didn’t see a business in Blogger. This was during the boom, but we weren’t one of these companies that was just, “Let’s get eyeballs.” We were very product driven. We wanted to create cool stuff, and we wanted it to have a sustainable business. We wanted to probably sell the com- pany to somebody eventually, but we didn’t see any business model with Blogger. Also, we hadn’t raised money, so making money was pretty important.

We thought Blogger was this free little thing that would get people to pay for the real thing. So we very clearly had a dilemma on our hands: we could focus on the stupid little Blogger app that people were using, or we could work on our real product. We tried to split our time amongst those two things and contracted to pay the bills. We were three people, so that was a little bit difficult. We had endless debates about what to do about that. I think we ended up doing another rev on Blogger in November that made it much better, and then people really started using it.

There were a couple other products out there, but they weren’t very substantial. No one was really paying attention to it. It’s hard to fathom now, but blogs took a really long time to be taken seriously. But, yeah, we felt we needed to make it a lot better and spend a lot more time on it, and we didn’t have the resources to do that. But at the same time, we didn’t think there was a business there, so we weren’t that concerned about it. All the time, of course, we are debating whether or not there was something there and debating why it was appealing to people. I thought about it a lot and I came to the conclusion why it was appealing and the impact it had, and I started to get some insight about its potential.

It was kind of the first time that I had started really seriously thinking about media, and then at the same time Pyra had all these big ideas that were going to take a really long time to build, and this was much more fun. So I said, “Well, we can figure out a business. We can charge for pro accounts and we can license it to companies and we can just make up the obvious businesses around it (even though they weren’t necessarily that strong).”

 We had most of the features planned that later became standard in the blogging world—and some that haven’t yet. We were totally focused on building the product and community around it once we had raised the money, because this was still, “you get enough eyeballs, you have buzz, you’ll be fine.” And the extent of the crash didn’t dawn on us that quickly. I don’t think it dawned on a lot of people. We just wanted to build momentum with this $500,000 and then raise more money later in the year.

At the time it was pretty much the belief that, if you have buzz and you have users and you have good seed investors, you can raise more money. We said, “We’ll make money, but this is down the road so we don’t need to focus on that. We are going to focus on building more features and getting more users.”

Other companies at the time were going into enterprises, since companies had money. At the time it was like, “Consumers aren’t spending money. Go to companies—they’re the ones with money.” So many companies at the time took their consumer Internet thing and made it an enterprise Internet thing and then died anyway. We debated that a lot. We had a good story about why this was really useful inside companies, and we had a friend at Cisco who wanted to use it and we got it installed inside of Cisco. It was just a pilot and we started saying on our site, “We have enterprise Blogger.” But there was a lot of pressure internally, a lot of debate about just doing enterprise, which I was pretty adamant that we didn’t want to do because, whether or not it would make money, I thought it was pointless. At this time I was very much excited about the idea of democratizing media and that’s what mattered. It mattered more than the company, really. When you are in that mode, it’s hard to say that the company doesn’t matter, since everyone’s heart and soul is in it, not to mention their livelihood.

Nick and his cofounder, David Galbraith, were fans of Blogger and wanted to buy us. It wasn’t a particularly attractive offer, but we were on the brink and thought, “Maybe we can get in there and everyone would have jobs.” Everyone in the company wanted to do the deal but me. But I had con- ceded, because I wasn’t going to be the asshole who denied the chance every- one had to still be employed. We were out of money. Fortunately Moreover’s board wouldn’t approve the deal. It was some ridiculously lowball offer—it was something like a million dollars worth of their stock. But they’re a private com- pany. So it was basically like, “We’d give everyone jobs.”

So this is December or January of 2001 and the second potential acquisition hadn’t worked out, so basically we got to the point where we sat everyone down, and I said, “OK, everyone is laid off as of today, including me.” We had warned them a few weeks earlier that we didn’t have money in the bank to meet payroll. Obviously when you are in that state, tensions rise a lot and morale wasn’t good and relationships with my cofounder weren’t good. I said, “I am going to stick around because I took a half of a million dollars of other people’s money. And we have all of these users.”

In January, right around the time that the rest of the company was being laid off, we did what we called the Server Fund Drive. We posted it on our website and it said, “Hey, we know Blogger is really slow. It’s because we need more hardware. We don’t have the money to buy it. So give us money and we will buy more hard- ware and we’ll make Blogger faster.” Surprisingly, it worked really well. We had a lot of goodwill and people liked us and we had a good brand within our users because we were very personable and used the blog and we were just honest. We just said, “We can’t buy hardware, but we have plans and we are not going to go away if we can get past this hump, so send us some money.” So people sent us money.

We told people we were only going to buy hardware, so I wasn’t going to use that to pay people. I just spent that money on hardware, but it got the site back up and running well and meanwhile we laid everybody off. Meg and I weren’t getting along well at all and she decided to leave and everybody else decided to leave too.

Yeah. I think a lot of that came back to the enterprise thing, which she and some other people felt strongly was our best chance of making money. If I was the guy in charge and we were dying, it’s reasonable to conclude it’s my fault. And certainly there were other things I could have done. So everybody left but me. (A lot of them needed to leave since we couldn’t pay them any- more.) Everybody left, and the next day, I was the only one who came in the office.

That was a really bad time. Actually the day that everyone told me they were leaving . . . I told everyone they were laid off and said, “Work with me if you can.” And at the time, everyone had already missed one paycheck, and they’d had it. These are, of course, my friends, and we were hanging out all the time and we socialized together, so it’s much more than just the employees. I think that same night I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 months.

The good news about all that was Blogger was still running and, with no employees, we didn’t have expenses. So we went from having $50,000 a month worth of payroll, to a couple of thou- sand for our server infrastructure and our rent. It is probably closer to ten, between five and ten, but a manageable number, not paying me anything. I took some money every once in a while to pay rent, and I had long since put all my money in and credit cards and everything else, but that was actually a much more reasonable place to be because we didn’t have to make $50,000 a month to pay people. We had to make a few thousand dollars a month.

One of the first opportunities was a little company called KnowNow, who wanted us to build something, and later actually two of the people who worked at Pyra, including Meg, worked for this company, and I did a little deal with them to build something that was never launched. They killed the project, but it got me $35,000, which was like months of burn rate at that point.

We were pretty public in terms of our communication, so I posted when everybody left, and I wrote this whole story on my blog that was pretty widely read, “Here’s what happened: everyone’s gone. It’s just me.” I got a huge outpouring of support from that, and one of the messages was from Dan Bricklin, who said that he thought what we did was great and he wanted to help. We ended up meeting at an O’Reilly conference, which was in February 2001. We met and he basically agreed really quickly. He assessed the situa- tion—what I needed to keep going. (We had a lot of back bills at this point; we needed to pay our hosting bill to keep the lights on.)

First of all, I had to keep the service running, which was a really big deal in itself—we had several thousand users and I had to teach myself Linux system administration and Java, so I could just keep the servers up and fix bugs here and there. Things would break, and I’d go in and fix them on the live site and figure it out as I went. That was very time consum- ing. The technology wasn’t rock solid by any means, and it kept growing and growing and I didn’t want to shut it off. Between that and fulfilling on these deals, which were mostly giving stuff to other people, I wasn’t building in the real things that were going to make a business. That was a lot of just day-to-day, by-the-skin-of-my-teeth stuff for several months. Still I had the idea to build a paid version of Blogger, but that was going to take a lot more development and work to launch that.

The other thing was that all those people left, and then I was being bad- mouthed within this community of people we knew. The story apparently was that I fired all my friends and I didn’t pay them and took over the company. It was really ugly, and of course we had all these mutual friends and there were parties we were at. I basically went underground and did nothing but try to keep Blogger going.

Which I think is a theme for startups in general because people live and breathe them and become friends, date and merge their lives together. And then, if things go bad, it’s bad in ways that are much more devastating than your work going badly.

Then eventually I started launching some for-pay features of Blogger. Things that people would actually pay for. So 2 years into it, Blogger itself was starting to make money—not directly but through some little ways. Like the blogs we hosted, we had advertising, which never made any money because it was during the time when web advertising didn’t make money. (After it made money the first time and before it made money again.) I created a mechanism to charge people to take their ads off and that actually made money. I said, “Pay me $12 a year, and I’ll take the ads off your blog.” I started with this “product” because it was probably the easiest thing I could build that I thought people would pay for. And they did.

I did a couple other small things like that and got to a point where it was paying the hosting bill. I had gotten rid of my office by then, and I had no place to work at home. So I posted on my blog that I needed to rent a desk some- where. This company, Bigstep, offered me a free desk, which was nice.

Then I just started building more things. Working from the Bigstep office, I designed and launched the Blogger API, which didn’t make any money, but became important later. I actually hired a contractor programmer and had started working with Jason Shellen on business development stuff. So things were looking up. And then 2002 was a completely different year altogether.

We finally launched Blogger Pro, the paid-for version of Blogger. The paid- for version of Blogger did very well for us and we brought in some other people. With Jason’s help, we did a big deal in Brazil with this company that wanted to license Blogger. So 2002 was a ramping-up year again. Everything was on the uptick, and we had a completely different team. We were getting by and the money was increasing and we were building new stuff and it was looking good.

October 2002 was when Google came knocking. We had a small office downtown—more of a conference room than an office. It was Adaptive Path’s first office, which we moved into after them. And we had brought on a tech support guy and a sys admin. Then Google called us up. I forget how that happened . . . I think that was O’Reilly again.

Soon after, according to the story I heard, Larry or Sergey were on a call with Tim and Tim mentioned us, and Sergey had recently been at this confer- ence where everyone was talking about blogs, and was interested in blogs and he said, “Yeah, we want to talk to them.”

We’re like, “Alright. Why?” It didn’t even occur to us that they might want to buy us because Google hadn’t bought anybody at this point. And they were a search company. So we brainstormed all these ideas maybe we could do with Google and we went down there, and it turned out that we were meeting with their corporate development people—meaning the people who buy companies. We started talking about ideas and within the first 5 minutes they said, “Yeah, there’re lots of ideas, but it’s hard for someone like us to really partner with someone so small as you; why don’t you just come here and do all that stuff?” So we were like, “Oh, that’s interesting.” (We tried to play it cool.)

What Google said was, “Would you consider being acquired?” And we said, “Well, we’ve talked to people, but Google’s never asked before.” Like everyone else, we thought very highly of Google, and we said, “Let’s talk about it.” Four months later, we were sitting in Google.

Mind you, it wasn’t an easy decision. I struggled hard deciding if going to Google was the right thing to do. We weren’t desperate. We actually had a term sheet on the table for $1 million in investment from Joi Ito’s Neoteny (who ended up investing in Six Apart). And after 4 years of pouring my heart into Blogger, I saw a lot of risk in giving up control.

At what point did you most want to quit? There were a lot of points in 2001 that I seriously considered quitting. Everybody I knew just thought I was crazy. And I was getting negative feedback on the Web; people who used to be my friends were posting negative things about me. We’d gotten enough press at that point . . . the Industry Standard, which was the bible of the dot-com era, had this annual list, the Net 21, titled something like, “The 21 people who had made lemonade out of lemons,” and I was one of them. It was pretty cool, but the title for me was “The Idealist” because I hadn’t sold out. Like I had a chance to have riches and I didn’t. Someone took that and wrote a parody: “The Egoist.” Because there was a story—not really on the surface, but very clearly underneath the community that I was previously a part of—that was a very negative story about what hap- pened in the last days of Pyra, because all those people left and they weren’t very happy (completely understandably).

For the most part, the old Pyra employees were cool with it later. But, during 2001, these stories got out that I took over this company and kicked everyone out and was just this terrible guy. That was the worst part.

And I was writing this service that was free and thousands of people used it, and all I heard were the complaints when it wasn’t working. So for many rea- sons it was bad. I don’t know how close I came to quitting. I don’t think I was terribly close, even though I should have been. I was always hallucinogenically optimistic. That’s the only reason I kept going. Not because I thought I could take this suckiness for a long time, but that it’s going to be better tomorrow. I had all these big ideas, and I could never stop thinking about the product and the thing I was going to build next.

For example, when the site got hacked on Christmas day. I was in Iowa, visiting my mom, and I didn’t find out until the next morning. Someone was able to run an update on the database that changed thousands of users’ passwords to the number 1 (which people started to realize when they couldn’t log in and used the forgot- ten password feature to get theirs via email). Having your site hacked is stressful enough, but here I was in Iowa trying to assess the damage over a dial-up connection and a tiny laptop. And I didn’t have a sys admin or anyone else working for me at the time. I ended up spending most of the day in a Kinko’s doing damage control. So much for enjoying the holidays.

I think one of the things that kills great things so often is compro- mise—letting people talk you out of what your gut is telling you. Not that I don’t value people’s input, but you have to have the strength to ignore it some- times, too. If you feel really strongly, there might be something to that, and if you see something that other people don’t see, it could be because it’s that pow- erful and different. If everyone agrees, it’s probably because you’re not doing anything original.

I had the personality that never liked school and rejected the normal way of doing things. Even when I was in school, I’d try to make up alternative solutions to math problems.

Another thing is that luck comes in many forms—and often looks bad at first. I always look back on the deals that we didn’t do and the things that didn’t work out, and realize what seemed like a bummer at the time was really lucky. Like the early acquisition opportunities. These obviously would have been really bad, as opposed to what happened later. Through that whole experience that’s one of the biggest things that I’ve taken away: if you have some plan and it doesn’t go that way, roll with it. There’s no way to know if it’s good or bad until later, if ever.

ne thing that I used to be bad at was paying attention to how other people are feeling. So when problems came up with some of my coworkers, it totally surprised me. That stuff shouldn’t surprise you, and it did.
I think I was also surprised by the success of something so simple. That’s a mantra for many people in the technology world—simplicity. But what we built wasn’t that amazing. It was the idea of putting a couple of things together and being able to establish a lead by doing something really, really simple. How far you can get on a simple idea is amazing. I have a tendency to add more and more—the ideas always get too big to implement before they even get off the ground. Simplicity is powerful.

## Tim Brady First Non-Founding Employee, Yahoo

_Yahoo began in 1994 as a collection of links to research papers maintained by two Stanford grad students, Jerry Yang and David Filo. They gradually added links to new types of information, and the site grew rapidly in popularity. By the end of 1994, Yang and Filo were considering turning the site into a startup, and they asked Tim Brady to write a business plan for it.
Brady had been Yang’s college roommate and was by this time getting his MBA at Harvard Business School. Brady initially expected to be able to finish the semester, but as Yahoo’s potential grew, it became clear that he couldn’t wait. He turned in the company’s business plan as his final assignment in the courses he still needed to pass, and jumped on a plane west to become Yahoo’s first actual employee.
Brady’s title during his 8 years at Yahoo was VP of Production. His respon- sibility, as he puts it, was “product.” He was effectively the editor of Yahoo’s site. Yahoo went public in April 1996, and for nearly all the period since has been the most popular network of websites in the world. Ultimately, Yahoo won the portal wars because it was a better site, and it was the site it was largely because of Tim Brady._

So Jerry gives me a call in the beginning of my second year of B-school and says, “My trailer mate and I started this thing, and it’s really starting to ramp up. I’ll have you take a look at it.” He wasn’t looking for advice; he was just telling me what he was up to. I looked at it and was blown away—the whole Web thing. I had been on AOL, I knew a bit about the Internet, but nothing about the Web. It was still pretty early then.

The story I’ve heard from Jerry and Dave is that they were both doing their PhD theses and all the technical papers that they would have to reference were online, so they were trying to keep track of them all. They had this big list, and then the EE graduate community—not just at Stanford but all the major EE graduate programs—found out about it and sent them emails saying, “Can you add this?”

In their spare time, Jerry and Dave would add categories they were inter- ested in. Jerry, having just come back from Japan, was very interested in sumo wrestling, so he had this great sumo category. Everything on the Web related to EE they had in their list and then these other interesting areas. It was early enough that it was really the only thing out there—big lists, anyway. There were small lists, but nothing big, and so people just kept sending emails asking them, “Add this to the list. My friend told me about this list; I’d love to add this.”

They were entertaining taking money and had decided, “We don’t want to sell ourselves. Let’s go for it, why not?” Even though people were more than happy to give them money, they thought, “We need a business plan to take around on our VC visits. Even though we can talk to them about it and they would probably give us money without it, it would be better if we had a busi- ness plan.” I said, “Well that’s good, because I’m taking a couple classes where I need to produce a business plan. Why don’t you send me your thoughts, and I’ll put something together.” They sent me their stuff, I wrote a business plan, they took it around to a couple VCs, and I ended up turning it in for final grades for a couple classes.

No one had any idea how big the Internet was, but the model was adver- tising. Advertising was well known, so it wasn’t like we were making up advertis- ing. HotWired, which was the online version of Wired magazine, was online by that time, and they were selling advertising. So there was a model out there, but certainly there were no search engines or directories selling advertising. I just used your basic business plan format, incorporated Jerry’s and Dave’s ideas, and added a few of my own.

We had enough traffic to go sell advertising. We knew if we sold ads on all our pages as of then, at a $20 CPM, that would cover our costs. It’s hard to remember back what your mindset was, but I know it wasn’t, “Let’s get every- one on the Internet.” That was way beyond us. The mindset was more like, “Let’s not let this sink the company; let’s keep it going.” And part of that was just making money, so we did a bunch of crazy things in addition to advertising to try to bring in money. We made book deals and a bunch of little things that really didn’t add up to anything. But we did anything in the name of getting money while we looked for proper management. Because we all knew it wasn’t us.

“If this thing is going to be as big as we want it to be, we’re not the people to run it,”—although we’d have loved to. So we had a CEO search for 6 months. It was really 6 months of struggling between then and when we got Tim Koogle to come.

 Netscape was the only browser back then, well before Internet Explorer. They had a directory button that was part of the browser, and they linked to us from that button for free. Netscape’s job actually was to grow the Internet—the way they were going to make money was to get everyone on the Internet and then sell servers. So anything with the purpose of getting people on would help them. They thought Yahoo was the best thing out there, so they gave us the link. It made sense for them at the time. That was big. It sent our traffic through the roof.

 We put up graphics, which was a big thing. That sounds really ridiculous now, but at the time Yahoo was all text. The connection speeds were so poor that any website that used a lot of graphics made the site unusably slow . . . Most of the traditional media folks didn’t get it because they didn’t realize that people were dialing in on slow modems. But we knew that if we were going to have any sort of brand, it would have to be a graphic. So we made the graphic switch at the same time we put up advertising.

 We started to hire and build an organization without the CEO. We had tem- porary management that Sequoia helped us find—a CEO and CFO. Because we weren’t having success finding a CEO, Sequoia insisted that we hire these managers. That didn’t go great. They weren’t as vested in helping Yahoo long- term as we were. There was a clear divide between someone who was interim and someone, like myself, who was fully invested in making it work. I had moved my whole life from the East Coast for it; my fortunes were tied to this thing, whereas theirs weren’t necessarily.

 We hired a lot of friends and friends of friends. You always hear “Never go into business with friends.” But with the first 20 hires, everyone knew each other. Consequently there was a high level of trust. Everyone was young. It was pretty much everyone’s first job, with the exception of the interim management. So people weren’t worried where the Internet was going; they were just looking for something interesting to do, and joining Yahoo qualified.

 There were a couple of seminal events where we thought we were going to get crushed by competitors. The first one was the directory button on the Netscape browser became a search button, and Netscape started selling the right to be linked from that button. Architext (later called Excite), which was funded by Kleiner Perkins, was a bunch of undergraduates from Stanford. They bought the Netscape search button with their venture capital money. Netscape was also funded by Kleiner Perkins.

 We bid up to a certain point in which we felt comfortable that we could make a return on money. After which point, we knew it became “investing in the brand,” and I don’t think we felt comfortable investing in the brand at that point. Because we didn’t know how big the Internet was going to be at that point. Even though the press was going crazy, the numbers were still pretty small compared to any other media. I think it was $5 million that Excite paid for that button.

Any time you talk to Microsoft, just the way they do business, they have the potential to do whatever the hell they want, so when you go to them their mindset is always, “We could partner with you, or we could do it ourselves.”

Jerry and Dave were way ahead of the curve. The ideas that they had really early on were right strategically and creatively. So everything we did through the middle of ’97, invariably we were first and we did it very well.

The one thing we didn’t do that all our competitors were spending a lot of time doing was search. They were crawling the Web and doing full text search, and our strategy was, “Look, that’s a technology game. We’re not a technology company, we’re a media company. Since there are so many of them out there, we’re always going to be able to rent it.” That was the thought back then, and until Google came along that strategy was perfect. Because, as things played out, that’s exactly what happened.

So what we did was that we searched our directory first, we gave you those results, and then, if we didn’t find anything, we kicked you over to a full-text search. So, when I say we “rented” that technology, we essentially partnered with full-text search companies to be the falloff searches that we had.

No one is ever going to be able to get so far ahead that we’d ever be in strategic risk of kingmaking a full-text search engine, because you just can’t do that. Google ended up doing exactly that. 

One, IPO windows don’t last forever. Markets get hot and then they don’t. If you go out, you can only go IPO while the market’s hot. Netscape lit that market afire for us. The other consideration was that we saw that one of the ways we were going to have to compete was to acquire compa- nies. The best way to do that was to have a currency other than the cash in the bank—to have a stock to pay people for their companies. So, in order to get big fast, which we thought we needed to do, we had to have a public stock. That was probably the biggest reason. Then raising money was obviously a third very important thing we needed to do.

I knew that I liked doing certain things, and, with most people, things you like you tend to be better at anyways. I’m good at building things, products specifically. Creative marketing, product marketing, which I had done earlier in my first job in Tokyo, was what I ended up gravitating toward.

The group of people that we had assembled was just great, so the hours were never dreaded. You enjoyed being at work, even though sometimes it was 16, 18 hours a day. That’s the only thing really specifi- cally that I think back on a lot.

But there were certainly companies that we missed. We missed Hotmail. Jerry and I had dinner with Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith, and they were explaining it to us and—I hate to admit it—we were saying, “I see it, but I don’t see how it can get big.” We were on this rocket ship, and they were talking about something that really hadn’t caught on.

What was really central to our understanding of the Internet was that it was this open system where you couldn’t really put up walls. One of the things that I think Filo did a great job of making happen was that, when someone did a search and you didn’t find what you were looking for on Yahoo, rather than just saying, “It’s not here,” or “Go check out this other thing,” he put links to our competitors, then prefilled the query, so you’d just click on Excite and they would do a search on Excite for the same thing.

Certainly they don’t teach you in business school to go point to your com- petitors, but it sent the right message to the users, which was, “It’s all about you. We’re going to get you the data you want. If it exists on the Web, we’re going to find it for you, even if we don’t make money off of it directly.”

: The sex category was probably a quarter of everything on the Web. Not just Yahoo, but everything on the Web. Just like the VHS industry when it first got going. The Internet was no different in that respect.

Do you remember the biggest debate that you got into? There was always speed versus look-and-feel. In trying to grow a brand, look-and-feel has a lot to do with it, as does speed, so there’s always that balanc- ing act. Arguing the necessity of graphics with Filo was always a big argument. I’ll never forget our 8-year debate.

I obviously never had equal weight in that decision. It was always Jerry and Dave, and I don’t know the full list of suitors. I know AOL was a suitor, I know the LA Times was a suitor, and I know they had gotten informal offers from Microsoft—never anything concrete. A lot of them were very early on, before they even took venture money. For Jerry and Dave—neither grew up with a lot of money—to turn down a lot of money at that stage with no guaran- tee of the company doing anything afterwards, was, in my estimation, a big deal. They had a lot of confidence in what they were doing.

The funniest thing I can remember was when there was a huge storm in May of ’95, and the power grid went down for a few days. We had to go rent a power generator and take turns filling it with diesel fuel for 4 days. 24/7. We were laughing, “How many pages to the gallon today?” It was a crazy storm and it also started leaking in our building. We had all these meetings scheduled and couldn’t just shut it down. We had meetings by candlelight with a bunch of prominent companies. They walk in; there are no lights; there are cords run- ning everywhere leading to the generator out back; water dripping from the ceiling. We were trying to convince them, “Oh, yeah, we’re a real business,” when you say, “Hold on, I gotta go fill up the tank.” So I remember that set of days pretty vividly.

“I know you’re tired, I know you’re working hard, but it’s not an excuse for putting out something that looks like a startup.” When Jeff came in, I’d been working hard for 8 months, and I was already a little bit tired, and I didn’t think he would keep up. I didn’t know him all that well, but he had twice as much energy as anyone. We started doing two red- eyes a week to New York for business. “OK, we have to go meet MTV tomor- row. Red-eye out. Meeting. Come back that same day.” We did that for 3 to 4 months, and I just remember thinking when he walked in the door, that I couldn’t work any harder. But we worked harder, faster, smarter. That was defi- nitely a step up in both effort and professionalism.

Any advice you’d give to someone who was starting a startup? Part of it is “know yourself.” Try to do as much thinking up front as to what your breaking points are. One of the things I think I did well was that I never spent any time thinking about quitting or any of these doomsday scenar- ios, “Oh, God, what if this doesn’t happen.” 

Before I joined, I knew where the line was, when I would quit, at what point, and so when I was in the game, it never crossed my mind. I also knew why I was involved, what motivated me, and I didn’t spend a lot of time perse- verating on that stuff. At the end of the day, it wasn’t going to get you anywhere. It mattered, but only in an abstract way, compared to the day-to-day of getting stuff done. Doing all that thinking all up front: why am I getting in, when do I leave, if I leave then why am I doing it, what gets me up in the morning, what could happen that could make me stop getting up in the morning?

## Mike Lazaridis Cofounder, Research In Motion

At the same time, my electronics teacher was also the president of the local amateur television and ham radio club. So he had us taking apart televisions and converting their tuners for use at the amateur band. Back then, we knew how to tune them, but we didn’t really understand what we were doing. It wasn’t until university that we started to get that understanding, but we saw how the stuff worked; we saw the potential. When my teacher started to see us really get seduced by the computer and what we could do there, I remember him saying, “Don’t get too caught up with computers, because it’s going to be the person that puts wireless technology and computers together that’s going to make a big difference.” I don’t think he was seeing what we eventually did, but he understood the fact that computers gave us two fundamental things. One was the ability to send information unambiguously, and the second was that it allowed us to control the RF process and make it more efficient.

The tricky part was, how do you intercept a market trend? How do you intercept an industrial trend? How do you package what you’ve learned and what’s happening in the technology space so that it has new value to customers? How do you find those customers?

What we learned with Mobitex and later Datatech was that there were some really interesting applications that were being developed, and we were right there while it was happening. But it took a lot of faith. You call it vision, but it’s a combination of vision and faith that 1) it’s going to happen someday, and 2) it has value, and 3) you can actually accomplish it in an eco- nomic way and promote it so that you can fund the development and growth of the business. That’s pretty tricky stuff.

We decided to build a very advanced pager. It looked like a pager; it was the size of a pager; it even seemed to operate like a pager. Except that it was a full-blown two-way email terminal. It took a lot of back-end processing to make that work. Something that a lot of people don’t realize is that the BlackBerry product is a system, and the email posting and reception is actually done by a server. We spent a lot of time getting it right, knowing that the market was not ready for it. We disguised what later became the BlackBerry as a pager.

Because people knew what a pager was, they could say, “Hey, I need one of those”? We gave them the opportunity to go two-way, so that they could send a message as well as receive it. That people found very valu- able. But the system was expensive—the monthly fee was expensive, because it was brand new; it was embryonic. But we knew that email was catching on.

We decided to launch it in New York, in the financial markets, because they were big users of systems and email. They were also affluent, so they could afford the service early on. They were big users of data and information, and they needed it in real time. To them, time was money in a big way. The BlackBerry system gave them that in spades.

## Arthur van Hoff Cofounder, Marimba

_Arthur van Hoff was part of the Java development team at Sun Microsystems when he left in 1996 to found Marimba, a software distribution company. Marimba was acquired by BMC Software in 2004._

Initially we all put in a little bit of money, I think $25,000 each. If you don’t take a salary, that can last you a long time. Because starting a company is free, right, if you have a friend who is a lawyer. The law firm that we used, Gunderson Dettmer, will basically not take payment until you get funding. Silicon Valley is that way; everything is geared toward getting you started, and then you pay.

We spent about $1,400 to furnish the entire office, including equipment like a fax machine and printer. We all used cell phones at first, and we had no Internet access for the first couple of weeks, just the whiteboard.

You know, in a hot market like that, you saw a lot of people with crazy business ideas that were never going to work but they were getting funded. We were coming out of the Java project and felt that it was a pretty safe bet that if you are part of a core team and you leave together, getting an idea is not that hard. Anybody can have good ideas.

One of the things that we wanted to build was a user interface builder. Java was an interesting model, but there weren’t any tools for it. So we spent the first few months working on a user interface, and then these guys from a small startup visited us and showed us their product, and it was pretty much what we were doing. They were acquired by Netscape like the next week, and they turned into the IFC (Internet Foundation Class). It was ironic because that eventually turned into the JFC, or Swing, the Java toolkit.

Well, all press is good press. It definitely helps. Whenever we wanted a meeting with an executive at a big company, we’d get it because we were very well known. Nobody had a clue what we were doing. So the mystique around Marimba gave us a lot of inroads to companies, which is incredibly helpful to get deals done.

There were always reporters talking to Kim because she was a female CEO of a technology company. I don’t know if that was a good thing. There was so much focus on her and so little focus on the company. 

Anybody can run a company up to 100 people. You just have to be intelligent and have good intuition. There’s a lot of tedious work you need to do, but it’s not that hard. But there’s a point when the company gets bigger that it just becomes a manage- ment problem; it becomes something that you have to have experience in. Managing people and motivating teams requires a very different skill; it’s not something that you can do by the seat of the pants. So the lack of experi- ence eventually begins to show if you don’t have somebody who can make deci- sions, for example.

We had this really funky power balance in our company where we had a really strong VP of sales and a really strong CFO and a really inexperienced CEO. And whenever there was a decision to be made, she couldn’t break the tie. And what do you do? Once Kim got replaced by John Olsen, he was com- pletely different. John had run big companies and it was really easy for him to make decisions that were very hard for us to make. And that tells you that as a founder, you have the skills to start companies from scratch, but it doesn’t nec- essarily mean that you have the skill to grow it till they’re larger.

Well, every business plan has an exit strategy and ours was IPO. That was the right choice at that time. Right now, you’d aim for an acquisition. Everybody that joins a startup hopes to get rich. They also do it because it’s fun, but you’re taking a bet on winning a lot of money. But the odds are skewed against you because not a lot of startups actually succeed in fulfilling that bet.

We exceeded our own expectations in the end. But a business plan is a tool that you use to sell the idea to VCs. The VCs look at it and say, “There’re no spelling mistakes and the math seems right. But I like the people so let’s invest.” A lot of the decision-making is very emotional. There’s no formula that identi- fies good business plans versus bad business plans. So I think it’s not really a fair question to ask “Did you execute on your business plan?” because every busi- ness plan is just a wild guess, right? You could easily add a couple of zeros everywhere and sell the same thing to people. Instead of 10 percent market growth you make 20 percent market growth, and suddenly you make $200 mil- lion more in the fifth year, but so what? They’re marketing tools.

And it tells you something about where you spend your money and what you spend your money on. It’s not just business-related expenses. You also have to create an environment that you like so that people are happy and feel they are valued.

In my experience, it rarely happens that they turn against you, because you’re a team and if the team isn’t working, the company will likely fail. Occasionally, when you’re a screw-up, they’ll have to make a tough decision and fire someone, but that’s rare in my opinion. Because they wouldn’t invest in your company if they didn’t believe in you and your team. So I’ve always had a good experience working with VCs.

We spent a lot of time talking about subscription-based software dis- tribution and that took a long time for people to get. In hindsight, we were probably a little early with that. Now it’s a very well-understood thing. The Microsoft operating system updates automatically. Updates to virus programs come over automatically. In the beginning, a lot of people we talked to said, “It’s too early. Do I really want to do this?”

f you have the energy to do it, then you should try it yourself. But you do need to have the ability to form a team around you with good people. Talent attracts talent.

A lot of people get stuck on the idea. They all want to invent something and go execute on it. I think that’s a fallacy. You have to have an unfair advantage in that you have to be good at something, or you have to have a direction that you’re interested in or a market that you see an opportunity in—but you shouldn’t get stuck too much on the details, because you can’t foresee your future anyway. Because you’ll go through so many changes, I don’t think it pays off to overanalyze the first business plan, for example. The first business plan is there to make sure you can use Microsoft Word.

Eventually, you need to go to VCs and attract money, and at that point you need to be able to put your plan in writing and sell it. That’s something you need to practice a lot. Start with your friends and your parents and eventually go to VCs. If you get good reactions, then keep doing it. If you get bad reac- tions, then stop immediately, because it’s a really bad idea to sell a bad plan. You can screw up once, but it’s hard to screw up multiple times, because the VCs won’t give you the time if you come up with a few bad plans.

Another good idea is to join a startup that already has funding. That way you can experience the startup atmosphere and all the pros and cons without really taking all the risk yourself. Because doing a startup does mean that you have to give up your job and your income and take the plunge. That’s what holds a lot of people back.

I’m lucky I really don’t need to work anymore. If I do a startup, whether it succeeds or fails is somewhat irrelevant—I do it because it’s fun. I’d like to suc- ceed. When it comes to taking a salary, at Strangeberry we worked for several years without taking a salary because we had fun doing what we were doing.

So we had to see the stock go down from $75 to almost nothing and we weren’t able to sell. We were legally able to sell, but you kind of talk yourself out of it because you think the risk is too high. If you do a startup and the company goes bankrupt, the shareholders lose their money, but you don’t personally lose your house. But a shareholder lawsuit is a personal lawsuit—if you lose, they take your house, so it’s a totally different ball game.

There’s a lot to be learned from doing a startup. It’s much broader than you think. Although I was the CTO, I wrote a lot of code, I did a lot of depositions, interviewing, selling, traveling, moving furniture. That’s the great thing about it; it’s not a regular job.

When it’s your first startup, there are a lot of people involved. You take advice from a lot of people, and that advice is not always the best advice. Very often, your intuition tells you to do something different, but then you go with the advice from the experienced guys anyway. And there were a few occa- sions where I look back and think, “If only I had gone with my intuition, things might have been different.” So I might rely more on my intuition if I were to do it again.

So unless you go into a completely different area, you have to be very care- ful about the intellectual property. So really what you’ve got to do is: don’t plan anything, don’t write anything down. Talk about it over a beer and then leave.

## Paul Buchheit Creator, Gmail

_Paul Buchheit was Google’s 23rd employee. He was the creator and lead developer of Gmail, Google’s web-based email system, which anticipated most aspects of what is now called Web 2.0. As part of his work on Gmail, Buchheit developed the first proto- type of AdSense, Google’s program for running ads on other websites. He also suggested the company’s now-famous motto, “Don’t be evil,” at a 2000 meeting on company values. Although not a founder, Buchheit probably con- tributed more to Google than many founders do their startups. Gmail was in effect a startup within Google—a dramatically novel project on the margins of the company, initiated by a small group and brought
to fruition against a good deal of resistance._

It was before Hotmail and I was in college at the time. If you wanted to check your email, you’d have to go back to your dorm room. I thought, “That’s so stupid. I should be able to just check it anywhere.” So I wanted to make some kind of web-based email. But I really didn’t know what I was doing, so it didn’t go anywhere. I wrote something, but it was never useful and never got off the ground. So fast-forward to much later: I was here at Google and I had worked on Google Groups, which is not exactly the same, but it’s related. After the first generation of Google Groups had mostly wrapped up, they asked me if I wanted to build some type of email or personalization product.

For quite a while I was just working on it by myself. I actually started out with some of the Groups code, just because I was familiar with it. I built the first version of Gmail in 1 day, just using the Groups code, but it only searched my email. I released that to some Googlers and people said it was useful, so it progressed from there.

Search is obviously very important. It was central to what we were doing at the time and it’s really useful for managing your email. I had ambitions of doing more than that, but search seemed like the natural first step—it was one of the things that was most obviously a problem. 

Everyone here had lots of email. This company is a little bit email crazy. I get 500 emails a day. So there was a very big need for search. That was the most obvious thing that I could do, and it was also one of the easiest. So I built this first version and it only searched my email, but even that was useful for other people, because we had a lot of the same email. So then they said, “It would be even better if I could search my own email.”

Nothing’s totally full-time, but it was mostly full-time. I still had some other projects that I would have to spend some time on, and inevitably I end up with side projects just because something catches my eye and I go off and work on it for a little bit. I think I may have something to do with 20 per- cent projects as well because I’ve created a few things on the side. AdSense, the content-targeted ads, was actually something that, if I recall, I did on a Friday.

For quite a while, it was just myself; and then another person, Sanjeev Singh, started working on it. But switching projects here, especially back then, wasn’t easy. It wasn’t like one day, you’re suddenly on a new project. So he still ended up spending a lot of his time on enterprise search, which he was working on at the time. It was quite a while before Sanjeev could really spend most of his time on Gmail. So it was pretty slow for a long time.

There’s a lot that was challenging about it, just because it’s very big, for one thing. We gave everyone a gigabyte of storage to start with. At the time, the standard was around 2 or 4 megabytes. A lot of people actually didn’t think that was real. They thought it was a joke—partially because we launched on April 1. They also thought it wasn’t possible. It can be a little bit tricky, because it’s a lot of data if you actually do the math: you have millions of users and they all have a lot of data, and then, to make the system really reliable, you need to keep several copies of the data, backups and everything like that. It requires a lot of research. It’s a lot of machines and a lot of systems to make that all work with- out requiring an army of people to maintain the system and keep it running. There’s a very complicated system problem there.

It turns out to make a big difference in how you build things. A lot of the strategies that you might use for web search can be problematic when you apply them to email at a systems level, simply because you need to make every- thing so fast. It has to happen right away. You can’t say, “Well, we receive email and then in half an hour it will appear.” Which is actually how it worked in one of my early versions—the email would come in and I had this little script that would incorporate it into the index, but it generated this long lag, and so that wasn’t really great.

The JavaScript was a big deal as well, because at the time that we first started doing the interface in JavaScript, most people thought of JavaScript as a tool for pop-up advertising and other obnoxious things like that. This was before the whole Ajax thing, so a lot of people were pretty skeptical that JavaScript could work reliably. Not without justification—it is a little bit tricky because if you do things wrong, you’ll crash the browser.

Actually one of the things that we added very early on, which at this point seems pretty obvious, but it turned out to be really nice, is the autocomplete when you type in the email addresses. Once you have it, it just seems so obvious. “Why wouldn’t you have autocomplete?” None of the other web mail providers had autocomplete. Now you don’t really even think about it, but it makes a big difference. You can send email so fast and you don’t have to remember the addresses. To my knowledge, we were the first web mail provider to do it.

You can delete email. The idea was that there’s valuable information in email and we thought, “Why would you perform these actions?” For delet- ing, we found three or four reasons why you might delete things. One is that you’re running out of space—which was the most common reason for deleting things, because you only had a 2-megabyte quota. We said, “If we give people enough storage, then they won’t run into that problem.”

The second reason was that people would delete things just because email quickly became unmanageable if they didn’t. So we said, “We’ve got search, we’ll try to make that efficient.” I can handle—I don’t know how many millions of messages are in my email now—but it’s not a problem. They don’t get in the way. They’re just there, and if ever I want to find that message from four years ago where someone made some funny comment about Gmail that is ironic at this point, then I can go back and find it.

Conversation view was new—when you click on a conversation and
you get all of the messages as cards instead of separate emails. It turned out part of the reason people were organizing their mail so aggres- sively is because they were trying to put the conversations back together. They’d put them all in the same folder—or they would forget and put them in the wrong folder and then the conversation would get split and they could never find the reply to this message.

There were all these little tools and tricks that people had for reassembling the conversations. Why not just put them all together to start with? At some point, we said, “Let’s hide the quoted text too.” Because that way you can just read it much faster without having to read the same content over and over.

 Absolutely, that’s very much how it developed. Every time we would get irritated by some little problem, or one of the users would say, “I have this problem, it isn’t working for me,” we’d just spend time thinking about it, look- ing at what the underlying problems are and how we can come up with solu- tions to make it better for them.

There are a variety of dimensions to the darkest days. Like I said, a lot of times it was sort of controversial, especially in the very early days, because people weren’t sure if we should even be doing this. So the general attitude would swing, and when it would swing against us, that was very hard to deal with. Later on, not as much.

We would have some system problems internally. In a previous generation, it wasn’t as redundant as what we finally released, and the hard disk in one of our machines that had everyone’s email stopped working. I came in and every- one I walked past would ask me, “When is Caribou going to be back up?” I was walking into the machine room with screwdrivers, and people saw me and were like, “Oh no!”

I managed to take apart the hard drive and transplant the electronics from another drive, so nothing was lost. Through the whole thing, we’ve never lost any data, which is kind of unbelievable considering everything that happened. A lot of the machines that Google is built on—commodity is the polite word for them—they’re regular PCs and so they’re not always the most reliable.

That took us a while to figure out. You don’t want to ignore all of those les- sons, because that would be a big mistake, but at the same time, sometimes you really are just solving a different problem. For example, the update issue: we needed to be able to update instantly. Something like search, you can have a little latency. If a document doesn’t get added for a few minutes, it’s not a big deal. So at a system design level, that actually makes a huge difference, even though it’s a seemingly small difference when you describe it.

Yesterday, I heard someone making a comment like, “These guys get lucky and now they think they’re smart.” But in fact, they really are smart and have good ideas. Sometimes people think that these guys just got lucky, and luck is always a factor in everything, but it isn’t sufficient. It takes more than luck to build something that successful.

Storage turns out to be a surprisingly difficult problem. It’s not solved. There are network attached storage (NAS) appliances, but they tend to be expensive and they have some other problems. Then you have what we do with PCs, and that’s technically pretty challenging—to take this big network of machines that are unreliable and build a big, reliable storage system out of it.

I was actually surprised to some extent at how positively some of the things we did were received. We were pretty nervous about some of our features. The idea of doing the whole thing in JavaScript—internally a lot of people were very unsure about that, but I think that our users loved it. It actually worked better than we expected it to. We were pretty nervous about it, because there are so many browsers out there and they all have plug-ins and some of these plug-ins will cause problems for you. It’s really worked out better than we thought it would.

It just sort of occurred to me that “Don’t be evil” is kind of funny. It’s also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent. They were tricking them selling search results—which we considered a questionable thing to do because people didn’t realize that they were ads.

Companies would just mix the ads in with the regular search results so people would think it was a search result. It’s kind of like fake news or some- thing. In a newspaper, they’re usually pretty good about separating out which things are advertisements and which aren’t. But the search engines at the time were all selling search results and mixing them in with the real ones, so it was a little bit of a differentiator that we always said that we would never do that— and haven’t.

But the real fun of it was that people get a little uncomfortable with anything different, so throughout the meeting, the person running it kept trying to push “Don’t be evil” to the bottom of the list. But this other guy, Amit Patel, and I kept kind of forcing them to put it up there. And because we wouldn’t let it fall off the list, it made it onto the final set and took on a life of its own from there. Amit started writing it down all over the building, on whiteboards every- where. It’s the only value that anyone is aware of, right? It’s not the typical meaningless corporate statement or platitude.

I’m suddenly reminded that, for a while, I asked people, if they were play- ing Russian roulette with a gun with a billion barrels (or some huge number, so in other words, some low probability that they would actually be killed), how much would they have to be paid to play one round? A lot of people were almost offended by the question and they’d say, “I wouldn’t do it at any price.” But, of course, we do that every day. They drive to work in cars to earn money and they are taking risks all the time, but they don’t like to acknowledge that they are taking risks. They want to pretend that everything is risk-free.

You should consider going to work at Google, start a startup, or go to another place where you are going to have that opportunity. For someone who’s pretty far down in a company, if they are going to try to change the whole culture of the company, I’m skeptical. When I was leaving Intel, one of my managers there was trying to convince me, “You don’t have to leave to do the startup thing. There are startup opportunities inside of Intel.”

## Steve Perlman Cofounder, WebTV

_One weekend in 1995, Steve Perlman tested his the- ory that the Web could look as good on a TV screen as it did on a computer monitor. In 3 days of round- the-clock effort, he built a thin client for surfing the Web, using a television as a display. He invited his friend Bruce Leak over to see what he’d built, and they knew right away it was a big enough idea for a startup. A little over a year after that first prototype, Sony and Philips sold the first WebTV set-top boxes to the public. In 1997, WebTV (now called MSNTV) was acquired by Microsoft for over $500 million._

What I would typically do is not sleep for 2 nights; then I would get 4 hours of sleep and go back to work for another 2 days in a row, and then get 4 hours, and so on. It was the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. Sometimes I’d take 10-minute cat naps by just laying my head down on my shoulders—just so I’d get some REMs. As soon as the dreams come, it resets your brain a little bit and you’re able to work again. We were sleeping at our desks. People would bring in pizza. My wife would sometimes cook some turkey meatballs and spaghetti in a big pot and then bring it over, and everyone would just chow down.

My admin, who came with me from General Magic, tells stories about com- ing in in the morning and trying to clean up. She’d pick up a folded pizza box and get scared because she’d find a guy sleeping underneath it—it was covering his face. It was really bad. My dog, when my wife would bring him over, he would find burritos, because the place was just a pigsty.
But we had the product out in 6 months because we knew we had to meet that Christmas. It was out by September.

My engineering background is as a hobbyist. I built a computer when I was 16 and then designed a graphics display to go with it and things like that. I’d read Kilobaud magazine and Byte magazine, and I’d go and print up some company letterhead, which I’d send to the chip companies—that are now people I work with officially—and I’d say, “Hey, we have great plans for new products. You should send me some sam- ples.” So I’d get all these chips for free. The ones I could get for free, I’d design circuits around their capabilities. They weren’t the ideal chips, you know. But what are you going to do—you’re a kid in high school; you had no money.

I was in Connecticut and everyone else was in California, so I was 3 hours off. I ended up shifting my schedule and actually was getting up around noon because that’s when stores would open: Jameco Electronics would open at 9:00 a.m. in California, which is noon in Connecticut. So what’s the point of getting up before noon, right?

I’ve always been a hobbyist, and it’s one of the reasons I kind of seamlessly go between software, hardware, networking, and material science. I don’t care—it’s whatever it takes to make the damn thing work. I don’t have much formal education in these things, but you learn. You build enough stuff; after a while, you see it. And if you reverse-engineer enough things, you learn what other people have done.

The guy arrived about 15 minutes before the compile was done, and so we kind of wined and dined him. We brought in a vegetable tray and had some drinks there and were talking with him and tried to be polite. He said, “I really don’t have a lot of time. I need to see your WebTV prototype now.” So then I look over to the prototype area, and Phil had just walked in with a WebTV pro- totype, “Here it is. The new build is loaded into this box.”

So for better or worse, it was ready to go, and we sit Sony’s CTO down on the couch. I remember saying to Phil and Bruce, “What happened when you tested it?” And they said, “What do you mean? This is the test.” So I thought, “Great. We’re doomed.”

We turned the thing on, and I don’t know how, but it was perfect. It ran per- fectly. It just happened to be a good build. It was pure chance, but it went through all the paces. We could go to websites and we typed in URLs and went to all the different things, and there it was: WebTV did what it was supposed to do. You could see the Web on TV.

The one website that the CTO went to that didn’t work when he was in Palo Alto was a Japanese website, because we didn’t support the Japanese charac- ters. We had one engineer, Mark Krueger, who we had worked with at Apple, working from Japan. He married a Japanese woman, so he lived there, and he had an ISDN line to a house in the middle of a rice paddy, literally. He was picking up a little bit of Japanese. When we went to Japan, we got to the Tokyo Hyatt, and I remember Bruce had a development system there—we had hauled these big computers with us. Mark had a development system at his place in the rice paddy. And the night before our demo with Sony, they went and did another build. They didn’t tell me about this, but Bruce stayed up all night working with Mark, and he integrated Japanese language support into the code. So, literally, we arrived in Japan with an English-only browser, but by the next morning we had it running English and Japanese.

We gave a great demo in Palo Alto, and now we’re going to give this demo to the president of Sony Corporation, and we’re going to fall flat on our face! Well, it didn’t crash. It worked beautifully. The CTO was there, and we said, “By the way, there was one web page that you went to in Palo Alto that didn’t work. Well, it does work now.” We typed it in, and, sure enough, it showed beautiful Kanji, and we won him over.

Then they said, “We want to go back to the original contract we negotiated with a 1-year exclusive.” And we said, “We would love to do that, but now we have a deal with Philips, and so we can no longer offer you an exclusive.” They were very unhappy about that, but, in the end, they felt it was worth doing. So there it was. We had a deal with both Sony and Philips—at the time, the two powerhouses in consumer electronics.

The following is not something from my personal experience—it’s a story told to me by the Mac team—but they said that, when they first did the dialog boxes for the Lisa, instead of saying “OK,” it said, “Do It.” They found that people were reluctant to click on that, and they couldn’t figure out why. Then, once they had a test subject there who just wouldn’t click on it, they said, “Why didn’t you click on that little button there?” He said, “I’m not a dolt. Why would I click on that?” People were reading it as “dolt,” not “do it,” because it was an unusual combination of words. So they changed dialog boxes to say “OK.” That little change greased the skids for people to click on dialog boxes.

It’s very small stuff like that, very often—that somebody sees something and has the wrong impression. The only way to learn that is by doing a lot of testing. In fact, that’s one of the reasons why the iPod was such a phenomenal success where the MP3 players before were not. The iPod had the design sensibility of an average person just trying to listen to music, whereas the previous MP3 play- ers were kind of technical exercises in understanding how music files are stored, and perhaps required very delicate balancing of your fingers to hit the buttons the right way, and so on.

I was very impressed with the engineering. When I looked at the floppy disk drive for the Apple II and I saw that it was a Shugart SA-400, but it was missing most of the chips that every other computer had in it, and realized that Woz had hacked the thing and was doing a lot of it with a combination of software and hardware, I was deeply impressed with the engineering. But it was not some- thing that I could see an average person using.

But I was ready to leave the world of computers. I was working at Coleco in 1983. At the beginning of 1984, I was calling up Lucasfilm and other people in the film industry because I thought, “Well, the IBM PC”—which was intro- duced in 1982—“is taking over the world. Its graphics display is so poorly archi- tected. It doesn’t even have square pixels. It has a palette of just eight primary colors—actually two grays and six colors. Clearly, it’s being driven by business applications and so on. My dream of where computers would go turns out to be the wrong one. It’s not going more toward the average person; it’s going more toward businesses. And that’s OK.” So I figured, “If I can’t do it in people’s homes, at least I want to be involved in creating exciting experiences on the silver screen and on television.”

So when Microsoft came to acquire us, we only had 56,000 subscribers, which was a fairly modest number. But they still were very interested in us and that convinced me—perhaps wrongly, but nonetheless convinced me—that their real objective was to capitalize on this market, to grow from what we were doing. Also their desire to create the campus here in Silicon Valley was the other thing. So I kind of thought—and maybe even this was their objective at the time—that they really were going to develop this area of advanced televi- sion systems. But, as time went on, it became apparent that they simply wanted to make sure that nobody else successfully deployed a product in this area. I think they saw WebTV as the only viable player out there.

I can’t operate in that environment. I’m just far too focused on the end result. And so for all those reasons—the fact that they were very resistant to adopt other technologies that they felt might be competitive, and the fact it was just a large organization, no worse than any other large organization, I’m sure, but, nonetheless, it was a large organization with a lot of politics—it became unbearable.

The worst thing that can happen to a startup is if the founding team—or the people who are leading the thing—do not get along. And it’s deadly when they don’t get along in front of the troops. I’ve come to realize over the years that companies are just the people that make them up. We like to think of them as business enterprises and having this value and that value. Well, if you are going to distill it down to just patents and you are just going to go after people for infringing your patents, I agree. Those companies are simply made up of intellectual property assets. But any organization that actually has a prod- uct they are trying to ship and/or service they are trying to provide, it mainly comes down to the people. And the attitude of the company distills from the top.

In an organization that is very large and has existing businesses that have been running for a long time, you could have some not-so-great things happen in the top of the company, and it doesn’t have as much impact. Maybe the employees aren’t so happy, maybe they don’t think so highly about their jobs, maybe they don’t work as efficiently, but the company can keep plowing along. But, in the early days, you’ve got nothing. All you’ve got are problems— problems that need to be solved, obstacles that need to be overcome. You need to have an incredibly strong bond and an incredibly synchronized view of the world amongst the key players if you are going to succeed.

A synchronized view of the world doesn’t mean you don’t argue about things, that you don’t have disagreements. You must agree on the philosophy, though, and on the vision. There are many ways to get there, but if you can’t agree on the vision, then obviously you’re never going to agree on how to exe- cute. And you’ve got to respect each other. You’ve got to have cordial relation- ships. You’ve got to be decent people. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen companies where people are fighting or arguing or nasty things are happen- ing––fists punched through walls.

There’s one example where a pair of pliers was tossed by the CEO at the controller. They sailed over her shoulder and lodged into the wall behind her. She dropped her papers and said, “I quit,” and stormed out the door. I’ve seen this stuff happen at different places, and these companies—no surprise—have not prospered.

We could have had all the technical talent and engineering know-how and business knowledge, but, if we were acting like Chinese fighting fish in a tank together, the whole company would have failed. And through those really diffi- cult things that I told you about, where we were running out of money, when we got the certified letter of rejection from Sony—all those different things I think would have easily knocked over a weaker triad. We persevered through all of it, and we never stopped. None of us ever doubted that we were going to suc- ceed. And none of us ever stopped to question whether or not we trusted the other. We never had to look at our back. And that is what allowed WebTV to persevere.

## Mike Ramsay Cofounder, TiVo

I was just back there, and I was looking at a bunch of venture firms and their portfolio companies. I was curious to see what’s the attitude of a typical startup in Scotland compared to here. I found that they are just culturally a whole lot more conservative and cautious. And somewhat lacking in self- confidence. You come over here and . . . I had a meeting recently with a couple of early 20-year-olds who have decided to drop out of Stanford because they got bored, and they are trying to raise money to fund their startup. They believe they can do it, and nothing’s going to hold them back. They have confidence, they have that spirit, which I think is great and is probably unique to this part of the world. Being part of that for so long, for me, has been very invigorating.

Can you tell me about some of the biggest technical challenges?  While people had talked about storing video data on a disk before, actually creating a consumer product that used a disk to store video was pretty radical because, at the time, it was really expensive. We had to make a bet on whether the price was going to come down fast enough to make this any kind of consumer product. Originally, this thing had 14 hours of recording time and we were going to have to charge $1,000 for it. We better be on a pretty steep curve, right?

But once we had decided that, the big deal was, “How do you use the disk?” A disk has got fast seek. It’s not like a VCR, where you have to record something on the VCR and that’s all you can do with it—once it’s recorded, you can play it back; it’s a linear thing; you can only do one thing at a time. What we saw on the disk was—because it’s a random access device and that little head moved really fast—you can essentially create the illusion of doing things simultaneously, so you can record and play back at the same time.

How to do simultaneous record and playback, pause and fast-forward and rewind and stuff like that cheaply and efficiently was the key attribute. In fact, that idea of how you implemented that through a device called a media switch and sort of managed all that flow of data—that became part of the Time Warp patent, which was one of our most important patents.

Figuring that one out was critical, and had not really been done before—simultaneously recording and playing back video in a very low-cost way that “just worked.” Maybe somebody had built a massive professional video editing system that cost a million dollars that could do that, but certainly nobody had done it to cost a few hundred dollars, and that was a big breakthrough.

The second was the harnessing of the program guide data to actually drive the function of the machine. Prior to that, and still to some extent today, that program guide data was generated by companies who had armies of people that were literally going through newspapers and calling up the TV stations. An entirely manual process of writing down what was on when, and a description of it. It’s scary, but I think most of that still happens today.

We looked at that and thought, “I wonder how accurate it is?” If it’s off a little bit, it’s not life and death, but, if it’s a database that you want to drive a DVR, and when you say, “Get me The Sopranos” or “Get me 24,” you are very intolerant of not getting it. So that data has to be accurate.

I remember complaining to the team once that we were like 6 months from release of the product and we hadn’t recorded anything yet. I said, “Don’t you think it would be a good idea to test that out?” And everyone would go, “No. That’s easy. That’s not the hard bit. The hard bit is pausing and all this kind of stuff.”

Then we had to decide, “How do you get it?” Today, you can switch on your TV and you get a program guide. It comes down through the TV signal. We thought, “Well, why don’t we just do that?” We realized that not all TV signals have it, and you could only get a certain amount of coverage.

So we finally decided, “All right, let’s get it over the telephone line.” We had to put a modem in this thing and it had to call up, and when it called up, we had to have a server at the other end that had all this stuff. It would tell the server, “I’m in ZIP code 94022 and I’m getting Comcast cable and I have the basic service; therefore, send me the program guide for just that.” And everybody was different. There were like 65,000 different combinations of program guide that we had to sift through so that you got exactly what you wanted and it matched exactly what your TV service was.

And we had to design this thing so nobody could hack into it. We wanted to make sure that nobody went in and stole your TV programs, or, perhaps more importantly, nobody could go in and find out what you were watching, because people don’t like other people to know what they are watching on television. It’s their business.

We had our fingers crossed. I remember once the thing broke, and we had to literally go in there and change people’s DVRs. It happened very early in the company. We responded instantaneously, and our customers hardly knew what had happened and we got them back on air. We looked at each other after that, and we said, “Thank goodness that happened right now, and not 5 years from now.” We put in place some things after that that made sure that you could never send data to a TiVo that would break it. Because you have 4.5 million TiVos out there, and if you get something wrong in a software release and you issue the software to all these TiVos and it breaks them, you are in a lot of trouble. So we had to ensure that that was impossible.

I would say that one of the reasons that TiVo is thriving today is that we were well-capitalized. We were able to power our way through the downturn— that early 2000 period when Replay went away. We were capitalized enough that we knew we could ride through it. While we had to make a few adjust- ments to the company, there was never a question that we were going to sur- vive. We knew we were going to survive.

Tell me about the launch and the first users. We launched at the end of March of 1999. We were manufacturing it through a third-party manufacturer in Milpitas, and we took the whole company over there and we all put on little blue jackets and caps and we watched them making TiVos. Prior to that, we had been shipping certain selective units. The previous January, 3 months before, we had launched at CES (Consumer Electronics Show), so people knew about us. We were in this hot debate with Replay, who were trying to claim that they were first, and we were first. We actually released the product and shipped first.

We had an arrangement with Philips, and they started shipping through their retail distribution system. We were fortunate because the press loved this idea of a young startup company that was screwing up the media industry, and the press loved this idea that we were locked in battle with Replay. We got a huge amount of publicity. People knew what TiVo was long before we ever put the product out. So we started to sell it and it went well.

We had to learn a lot. I remember one weekend, we took the entire com- pany, which was about 60 people at the time, and we divvied them up and went to all the Fry’s stores in the Bay Area, because they were selling at Fry’s. We set up demo stations and the employees were giving demos. It was great because almost everybody had no experience of what it’s really like to sell in a retail store. So we started to do all that stuff, and it began to take off.

During that period, we did a deal with Sony and we did an important deal with DIRECTV. We started to supply DIRECTV with TiVos. That became a big deal for the company and still is today for that matter. So we started to branch out to some different partnerships there, and one thing led to another, and we grew.

It was interesting because the press who reviewed it . . . there were two kinds: the technology press, like Walt Mossberg, who hated it because it wasn’t techie enough for them; then there was the consumer press, who loved it because it was nice and simple.

I can’t tell you how hard it was to get a bad review. It just tore the company apart if somebody wrote a bad review about TiVo and we read it. “Oh God. How can we deal with this?” It was a gut-wrenching time for the company. As everyone started to review it, some people liked it, some people didn’t. But at the end of the day, it worked out just fine.

he thing that really got them was pausing live TV. That was the hook. You go, “Blah blah blah and it can pause live TV.” They’d look at you and go, “Wait a minute. Pause live TV? How do you do that?” “Well, technically, you do it this way and that way.” “That doesn’t work. You can’t pause live TV. It’s live!”

It’s clever enough not to get any repeats, so you only get the real one. And it’s clever enough to deal with times changing and durations changing. So if you have a season finale that lasts two hours, TiVo will automatically figure that one out. People loved this idea of “Get me a Season Pass,” and then they can forget about it. We expanded that to WishList, which says, “Get me all the Martin Scorsese movies,” or stuff like that. “Clint Eastwood westerns.” Those were very attractive to people, and over time it became pretty clear that this was something very new and different.

Thinking back on the early days of TiVo, what surprised you the most? The fact that these media companies got involved and embraced it and invested in it and are involved in it today. I would not have anticipated them doing that. Given their earlier reaction, I would have thought it would be impossible, but it happened. They know that is a dynamic that is driven by the human spirit; that they ought to embrace it rather than fight it. All the resources they have in the world, all the billions of dollars, can’t stop people being creative. There are a lot of companies who, in one way or another, have changed the rules of the game for the better. It’s just going to happen. I think we helped a very conservative industry get their minds around that.

## Paul Graham Cofounder, Viaweb

_Paul Graham and his friend Robert Morris started Viaweb in 1995 to make software for building online stores. A few days into writing the first prototype, they had a crazy idea: why not have the software run on the server and let the user control it through their browser? Viaweb was one of the first companies to deliver on the Web’s promise of creating a level playing field. Using Viaweb’s software, small businesses could make online stores as good as those built by big catalog companies. And many did: by 1998, Viaweb Store was
the most popular e-commerce software. Viaweb was acquired by Yahoo in June 1998 and renamed Yahoo Store. In
2005, Graham cofounded Y Combinator, a seed-stage investment firm._

Before Viaweb we had a startup called Artix. We were going to put art galleries online. The problem was, art galleries didn’t want to be online. They still don’t want to be online. We spent a long time trying to convince these people to use something they didn’t want before we had the idea that maybe we should make something people actually did want.

In the very, very beginning, no, we didn’t have any funding. It was just me and Rtm [Robert Morris] in his apartment. It was in the middle of summer. Rtm was in grad school, but because it was the summer he had some free time. We just said, “OK, we’ll try and write a prototype.” We wrote the first version in a couple days. At first it was going to be software that you would use on your desktop computer to build a website that you would then upload to a server. Then in the first couple days of working on it, we had this idea, “Hey, maybe we could make this run on the server and have the user control it by clicking on links on a web page.” So we sat down and tried to write it and, sure enough, you could write a program that worked this way.

Trevor is a prodigy, in the original sense of the word. When we first recruited him, we asked him to write this little piece of image-manipulating software, to kind of test him out. For 2 weeks we heard nothing from him, and I had pretty much written him off. Finally he sent me an email asking me to come to his office to see what he’d done. I went there expecting to see this new image software, and instead he’s rewritten our entire system in Smalltalk— everything I wrote, plus everything Rtm wrote.

I basically said, “OK, you’re hired. Now go and write the damn image soft- ware, because we’re not rewriting everything in Smalltalk.”

Things kind of came to a head with Rtm. We had this angry phone conversation where he said something like, “We’ve been working on this thing for a whole month, and it’s still not finished.” It’s funny in retrospect, because we were still working on it 3 years later. At the time, I was just thinking about how to get him to keep working on it for another month. But that was the main reason we got Trevor. Robert basically rebelled, so I thought, “All right, we need more programmers.”

Well, first of all he was my best friend, so I really trusted him, but he’s also one of the best programmers in the world. I’d rather have a quarter of his brain working on some problem than 100 percent of most other people’s.

Robert used to get up early, whereas I stayed up till four and got up at noon. So we would kind of work a 24-hour schedule. I would write some new code during the night and send Rtm an email saying, “OK, we’ve got all these new features in my part of the code.” Then he would write the corresponding stuff in his part. So we got code written very fast.

The next turning point was when we had a working demo—when we actually built an online store using our software and you could order from it, and edit it through Netscape. We started Viaweb in the middle of July ’95 and I think we had this first demo in early August.

The first people we showed it to were some potential investors. We ultimately decided not to take money from them, because they wanted a major- ity share of the company for a comparatively small amount of money. But the existence of these potential investors did spur us to write our first version, to get that demo working.

What we really thought we needed to do was write more software. We were software guys. Maybe someone who knew more about business would be thinking about going and getting customers, but frankly the idea of cus- tomers frightened us. We thought, “Before we go get any customers, why don’t we just write a few more thousand lines of code?”

Being a sales guy and being a hacker are two very different kinds of work. We were very comfortable dealing with hacking, but dealing with cus- tomers seemed like this terrifying unknown. If it seems strange to you that we were afraid of customers, imagine how the average sales guy would feel about modifying the software running on his laptop. The idea would seem terrifying. Whereas to a hacker, big deal.

We were very encouraged that the angel investors wanted to invest. We gave demos to two investors. We only wanted to raise $50,000, but both of the investors who saw the demos said yes. So we thought, “All right, we’ll raise $100,000 then, since they both said yes.”

We felt like we had to have five or six customers to launch. And for these first customers, we basically would do whatever they said in order to get them as customers. We gave them the software for free for as long as they wanted. We built their sites ourselves. If they needed to have images in them, we would scan the images. We were basically web consultants, because we needed users; you can’t launch a thing like this without having any users.

That’s one of the problems with web-based software. If you’re making desk- top software and you launch the thing, no one can tell how many other users there are, right? But if you’re making web-based software and you’re hosting the websites that these guys build, then if you don’t have any users, the entire world can see that.

The people, it turned out, that really wanted our software were individual merchants—guys who had some kind of specialty store selling antique chess pieces or something like that, and up till now had relied on people coming to their shop to buy stuff, or maybe occasionally they would mail out a xeroxed price sheet. For these guys, the Web was huge, because it allowed them to have what the catalog companies had. Those users loved us.

So if you’re writing applications for end users, you have to remember that you’re writing for an audience that has been traumatized by bad experiences. We worked hard to make Viaweb as easy as it could possibly be, and we had this confidence-building online demo where we walked people through using the software. That was what got us all the users.

The other thing was, we had good graphic design. Our secret weapon was that we knew that e-commerce was really about graphic design, not transaction processing. Unless you had a site that could convince people to buy, you didn’t have a transaction to process, and what convinced people to buy was how good the site looked. So we made sure that our software made great-looking sites— not just better than our competitors, but better than most of the sites that big companies paid web consultants half a million dollars to make for them.

We didn’t even process credit card transactions till about 2 years in. We would just forward the order to the merchant, and they’d process it like a phone order.

Our biggest competitor was a company called iCat. Fortunately for us, they were not very good at writing software. They were, however, very good at raising money and seeming corporate. At one point they did one round of funding that was more than our entire valuation, in fact probably twice our valuation. But fortunately they were never a threat technically.

There was another competitor called Shopsite that was better technically, but still not too dangerous. Plus they were out in Utah; they weren’t really con- nected to the startup world. Whereas iCat was in Seattle, which was much more startuppy. For some reason there were no serious competitors in Silicon Valley.

That was my first introduction to something that turns out to be a very important lesson for startups: it’s never a deal till the money’s in the bank. So many things can go wrong with deals, and they all do. Before we ultimately got bought by Yahoo, we probably had nine or ten different acquirers that we were talking to, and things always went wrong for one reason or another.

There were always two stories going on simultaneously with Viaweb. There was the software and the customer story, which just went smoothly and wonderfully the whole way along. We kept writing great software, we kept getting more and more customers, the customers loved us, the growth was this beautiful, smooth upward curve. Simultaneously, there was this story about the business, which was one disaster after another. So most of the actual turning points are not software or customer turning points, because everything went great there. All the turning points are business turning points.

Oh God, that was so great. I remember Fred’s first day. The metals trader was an extremely fearsome guy. He seemed like the kind of guy who would wake up in the morning and eat rocks for breakfast. On Fred’s first day, the metals trader called up, and Fred answered the phone and said, “Hi Alan, are you buying or selling?” And I was so relieved. Finally I had someone to take over that stuff. It was such a relief to have someone who would deal with the investors, so that we could just write software and make users happy. That’s all we wanted to do.

You know, in retrospect I think the big problem with our investors was that we weren’t forceful enough with them. I think investors like to be bossed around, like horses. It reassures them when you’re in control. But these guys were much older than us and had given us huge sums of their money, so it was hard for us to boss them around.

We were big beneficiaries of that rule that on the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog. We were just a bunch of guys in an apartment with com- puters. Nowadays more people accept that startups look like that, but not back in the mid-’90s. People still expected a company to have a real office. I think if some of these companies whose online stores were on our server could have actually seen the room that the server was sitting in, they would have freaked. Thankfully they never did.

If anybody ever did want to come and visit us, we pulled all kinds of tricks to make ourselves seem more legit. When that first giant company wanted to buy us and sent people over to check us out, all we had in our so-called office was one computer. Robert and Trevor mostly worked at home or at school. So we borrowed a few more computers and stuck them on desks, so it would look like there was more going on.

Early on, people found out about us through word of mouth. We were the underdogs—the guys who have better technology but nobody’s ever heard of. This was the point where we stopped seeming like total underdogs and people started to know about us. Part of the reason was that we hired a fabulous PR firm with this money, Schwartz Communications. We told them, “When people talk about e-commerce and they have to mention a few examples of companies, we want to be one of the companies they mention.” The most valuable sort of press is not articles about you, it’s when people mention you in passing as a matter of course. That’s what you really want—whenever anybody talks about e-commerce, for them to say, “companies including . . . and Viaweb.” Schwartz got us that within a couple months.

There were always people trying to buy us. There was another one just at the point where we found Fred Egan—a Japanese company that later made an imitation of our software and went on to become a big success in Japan. Rakuten, they were called.

We did have at least one more funding round, under the most disas- trous circumstances. One of these companies that tried to buy us—actually the second to last one; we were almost done—was a big Internet portal. We had a handshake deal with them and in the process of the due diligence for the deal, it was discovered that one of our programmers had signed a piece of paper with the company who had paid for him to go to graduate school, saying that every- thing he thought of belonged to them.

What it said on the piece of paper was that they owned ideas relating to their business. But this was a huge company and arguably just about anything you could do with software related to their busi- ness. So we had to go and get a release from them and that took a long time, during which the acquirer welched on the deal.

It turned out to be good in the end, but we had to raise our last round of funding while this was happening. You want to raise a round of funding with an IP cloud over your head? It’s just impossible, because potential investors have no way of judging how serious it is. It could be no big deal, or it could be that this other company owns half your software.

Ultimately we managed to get some bureaucrat within the big company to give us a release, so we could say to acquirers we actually owned our software. But we had to do a round of funding before that, because we were out of money. It was pretty miserable. Basically, the angel investors played chicken with us. They knew we couldn’t get money from anyone else, since we didn’t even know for sure if we owned our software. So they proposed to do a cramdown round where they would refinance the company, I believe, at a pre-money val- uation of zero—meaning all the common stockholders were completely wiped out. To keep us around, since they kind of needed us to write the software, they were going to give us options. So we called their bluff. We said, “If you do that, we’re leaving.”

So when it came down to that, they com- promised and we ended up doing a funding round at a low, but reasonable, valuation—$12 million, I think. We got bought only a couple months after that round closed. But we had to do the round because we were in debt at that point.

Well, everybody ended up rich, so it’s hard to be too displeased. I’d rather have an investor who invested in us and made our lives hell than one who didn’t invest in us at all, which is what most investors do to most startups. I mean, we needed their money to grow the company, and some amount of stress always comes with the money.

In retrospect, I think it was more about control than money. They weren’t trying to rob us so much as take over the company. They were offering us quite a lot of options. The point was, we’d have to do what they said from then on, or lose them.

How did it go with Yahoo? We liked them. They were like us. They had hacker values, basically. They were from graduate programs in computer science too. They were our tribe of people, not these weird business people we kept having to deal with. Plus they weren’t jerks about the acquisition. So many companies play hard- ball in acquisitions. It’s so stupid. Don’t they realize that the people they’re trying to squeeze are going to have to work for them afterward? Yahoo was very upstanding about the deal. They didn’t require any vesting, for example. We could have quit the day after the deal closed. But because they’d been good guys, we worked hard to make the acquisition work out well for them.

It did, too. Yahoo made a lot of money from this software. When you tell people you sold a startup to Yahoo in 1998, they get this knowing look, like you sold someone a bag full of air for a hundred million dollars, but Viaweb was a real money-making acquisition for them.

There was a point where I had to change our front page to read Yahoo instead of Viaweb and then it really hit me. Viaweb is gone. Viaweb doesn’t exist anymore. That was so weird. And I told myself, “Look Paul, don’t get sentimental. You built this thing to sell it. That was the whole point, and now you’ve sold it, so stop whining.” But boy, it was strange to think that when I clicked on “publish” and replaced the Viaweb front page with the Yahoo front page, Viaweb would never be seen again.

I think Yahoo is smarter now about dealing with startups than they were then. We were one of the first companies they bought, and I think the idea was, back then, that what you should do with an acquisition is “integrate” it, in the same way that a sugar cube becomes integrated with your tea. We basically got dissolved within Yahoo, and all the people working on Viaweb—or Yahoo Store as it then became—got dispersed to all the corresponding bits of Yahoo. The engineers got put with the engineers and the people working on customer sup- port got put with the support people and the sales guys got put with the Yahoo sales guys.

It seemed to Yahoo that this was the most efficient, organized way of doing things, but actually it was terrible for us. We had been this little tight-knit group that worked really well together and suddenly we were spread out all over Yahoo.

Never believe it’s a deal till the money’s in the bank. Even at the point where you walk in that room to sign the final papers, there’s still a 10 percent chance the deal’s going to fall through. At the point where people say, “We want to buy you,” the chances of it falling through are like 80 or 90 percent. So you can’t let yourself believe. If someone wants to make you an offer, fine, but don’t change your plans based on that. Just keep going.

One thing that was surprising was that it actually worked. There we were, in the summer of 1995, thinking, “We don’t know anything about busi- ness, but we’re good programmers. Maybe if we write a really good program, we’ll make something all these users will want and we’ll get lots of users and then some big company will buy us.” And 3 years and enormous numbers of ups and downs later, that’s exactly what happened. We had this theory about how business might work, and we sort of forced it to conform to our theory.

I know Robert was surprised that we made any money, because I have a real index of how he was feeling about Viaweb early on. A couple months in, he and I were having dinner, and I made a bet with him that if he ever made a million dollars out of Viaweb, he would get his ear pierced. So the day after the Yahoo deal closed, Trevor and I grabbed him by one arm each and took him down to the Garage in Harvard Square, where all the teenagers get their nose rings, and we got his ear pierced. He spent a long time trying to pick out the smallest one.

I found I could actually sell moderately well. I could convince people of stuff. I learned a trick for doing this: to tell the truth. A lot of people think that the way to convince people of things is to be eloquent—to have some bag of tricks for sliding conclusions into their brains. But there’s also a sort of hack that you can use if you are not a very good salesman, which is simply tell people the truth. Our strategy for selling our software to people was: make the best software and then tell them, truthfully, “this is the best software.” And they could tell we were telling the truth.

I wouldn’t worry so much about seeming like a real company. Now I would just say, keep it a bunch of guys operating out of an apartment for as long as you want, because there’s nothing to be ashamed of in that, especially if you’re writing great software. Another thing I would do is open an online store ourselves. We did use our software for building our website. We were the only one of all our competitors who actually used our software for building our own corporate website. But we didn’t have anything people could buy online. If we had been selling stuff, we would have understood what life was like from the merchant’s point of view.

One thing I regret is how pathetic we were during much of this whole process. We all had practically zero assets when we started, and this was during the Internet Bubble, remember—very early in the Internet Bubble, but still, there were people starting companies and getting them bought for like $5 mil- lion. Millions of dollars, when the most money I’d ever had in my bank account was about $10,000. There was a point where we started to seem like a real com- pany—that is, real enough that someone might actually buy us—and this made us just pathetically eager to sell the company. We must have seemed like such losers.

I also kind of regret being a zombie for several years straight. I really had no life during Viaweb. If people are talking about some famous movie and I’ve never seen it and have no idea what it’s about, it’s usually a movie that came out between 1995 and 1998, because at that point, I was on Mars. I was not part of the ordinary world of humans. I was sitting glued to a computer all day long, or asleep.

The advice I would give is to avoid it. I would say spend as little as you can, because every dollar of the investors’ money you get will be taken out of your ass—literally in the sense that it will take stock away from you, but also the process of raising money is so horrible compared to the other aspects of business. You can’t work your way out of it like you can with other problems. You’re at other people’s mercy. The way not to have to raise money is not to spend money. Do everything as cheaply as you possibly can. What you want in a startup is this feeling of cheap and hip. Not miserly cheap, but cool, bohemian cheap. That’s what we strove for.

robably, but I worried about all the different things that could kill us and all the different ways they could kill us. People start startups to get rich, but what keeps them going day to day is the fear of failure. You’ve said, “OK, I’m starting this startup and I’m going to get all the users and be successful,” and once you’ve told everybody that’s what you’re doing, if you fail you’ll look like a fool. 

o when we did sell the thing finally to Yahoo, in the eyes of the world, because we got bought, we were a success. Arguably we were already a success, since we had more online stores than anybody else. But getting bought kind of locked that in. At that point you would think someone would be thinking, “Wow, this is great. I’m rich. I can go buy everything I want.” But all I was thinking was, “Thank God we didn’t fail.”

Oh yeah. In fact, I don’t know how people who haven’t done it can pick founders. How can they tell? I often see people who seem kind of clueless, and I can remember, “Yeah, we seemed clueless in exactly the same way.” So those are the guys we invest in.

## Joshua Schachter Founder, del.icio.us

_Joshua Schachter started the collaborative bookmark- ing site del.icio.us in 2003. As often happens with start- ups, del.icio.us began as something Schachter built for himself. He needed a way of organizing his collection of 20,000 bookmarks, and he hit on the idea of “tagging” them with brief text phrases to help him find links later. He put del.icio.us on a server and opened it up to other people, and it began to spread by word of mouth. In early 2005, Schachter decided to turn del.icio.us from a hobby into a company. In March of 2005, he left his job to “found” del.icio.us and focus on it full-time, raising $1 million in funding.
In December of that year, Yahoo acquired del.icio.us for an amount rumored to be about $30 million._

It goes back quite a while. In 1998 or so I created a website called Memepool. There was an editor, with reader submission. We had a contribu- tion pool, and we’d edit and post stuff. It was chronologically sorted, updated every couple of days—so it was basically a blog before that word came out. We put a link at the bottom, “Send us an email. Give us good links.” And people would email us stuff they found on the Web. I would dutifully look at it and write it down. It took me a long time to post anything, because I’m not a great writer.

Over time, I had these links that just piled up—links that I’d found, or surfed for, or had been sent in, or whatever. By 2001 or so, I had a text file filled with 20,000 links. I couldn’t find anything in that file anymore, so I started put- ting in notes. I’d put the URL, a space, a hash mark, and then a word or two describing it. I think the first one was “math,” so I could grep out all the things that were #math and get all my items marked as math. In some sense, these were the first tags.

After a while, I couldn’t really do this, so I built a sort of next generation of that text file, which was called Muxway, in 2001. It was a lot like del.icio.us. There was a bookmarklet; you saved things; you could describe and tag them. It was single-player—no one else could use it—but the actual website was visible to other people. I discovered over time that people were subscribing to my bookmarks. There were some 10,000 daily readers looking at my stuff. That was interesting.

In late 2003, I started working on del.icio.us, which is a multiplayer version. I was actually trying to come up with a better Memepool—something between Muxway and Memepool which was more vital somehow, and we ended up with del.icio.us. I had it partially done for the first Foo Camp. I’d been invited to Foo Camp for GeoURL, and I had stuff to show for del.icio.us, but I didn’t show anyone. I chickened out because I was embarrassed at the state of the thing. So people were using it then, but it was more generally released later—I think toward December of 2003. 

Through 2004, I kept working on it and started to get press and lots of users. By the end of 2004, I had 30,000 users.

Notreally.Iwasalwaysverycareful(notanymore,becausetheguys that I work with are better programmers) to structure the code—each chunk of code wasn’t larger than the screen—such that I could come in and look at it, fig- ure out what I’m doing, do it, and be done for the day in 15 minutes. So if I could get one thing done a day, I was happy. A lot of stuff, if I could spend more time, I did, but as long as I could get one or two things done a week total, if I didn’t have time, I didn’t have time.

Why did del.icio.us succeed? First of all, because it was not a venture to start. I was building a product and that’s it.  I think in general being overcapitalized is a path to failure. The VCs want you to spend. There are general ills with being overfunded. I think the competitors had already disappeared by then. The tag- ging thing was probably essential.

There was no point at which I said, “I’m inventing this wonderful new thing.” I just sort of realized that I had evolved my own filing system, and it worked for me. I’d used it for a long time before del.icio.us even showed up. This was the codification of that practice. 

Yeah. For example, in Muxway, the internal table that tracked that stuff was called Tags. The name had come along at some point, but I don’t remember exactly how it showed up. 

One of the most challenging things was getting payroll going. PEOs typically don’t want to do less than five employees.

What were some of the biggest technical problems that you encountered? Scaling, inevitably. Scaling, dealing with bandwidth, dealing with routing, networks. This is for consumer Internet kind of stuff, but there’s a great deal of stuff that you have to flawlessly execute on. It has to be done well, but everybody does it well, so it doesn’t differentiate at all. Like your connec- tion has to be up. Your office needs to have DSL. There’s a great deal of crap that has to be executed better than competently that is no value for you to actu- ally do yourself. So outsource that.

For example, the payroll. I was capable of going 2 to 3 months without salary, but other employees certainly were not. So that kind of stuff.

But you need to pay attention to the important stuff. Scaling was important and core to the product, but dealing with the network, getting the hardware racked, building machines, ordering stuff, getting pricing out of Dell, you name it. That was a lot of work that was not useful.

Do you remember a time when you were worried about some- thing?

Site’s down. Site’s slow. Table crash—MySQL corrupted a table. That happened all the time. A great deal of what we did was putting out fires. We didn’t have a lot of process management in place, which probably hurt us a great deal.

A week after the acquisition, the power of the data center dropped and cor- rupted every single machine. We were down for like 48 hours. That was hor- rific. The power bounced in the network; the machines didn’t come back up because they weren’t configured quite properly. We weren’t careful about that.

For example, the rebuild script takes 24 hours, but that’s not a big deal because this part of the system isn’t live yet. But when it is live and it takes 24 hours to redo, that’s a big deal. So fix it. Make it work in 2 or whatever. There’s a lot of stuff that you can’t get around due to SQL, like you can’t change the database without bringing the site down.

Knowing what I know now, I would have designed the back-end architecture differently, and that would have saved a lot of work now. Scaling past one machine, one database, is very challenging, even with replication. The tools that are there are not quite right.

For example, when you add things to a table and it numbers them, that means you can’t have a second machine also adding to them because the num- bers will collide. So what do you do? You have to come up with some completely different way to do it. Do you have a central server that hands out number sets, or do you come up with something that’s not numbers? Do you use random numbers and hope they never collide? Whatever it is, auto- assigned IDs just don’t fly. There’s a stack of about 15 things that I have, a big list of pitfalls.

I think people ask for features—they want to do something, but they don’t say, “I want to do that something.” They translate it into some feature that typically they’ve seen somewhere else and ask for that instead. I want a feature that does this. “Why do you want to do that?” Then it turns out there’s some better way to do that. So, stuff that people ask for, I tend to try and dig to the root cause, before reducing to practice.

People frequently aren’t quite sure what they want. Then there’s a whole bunch of stuff that’s like, “Feature 1 and feature 2 suggest feature 3; ask for fea- ture 3.” And I just know that people are never going to use feature 3 and the implementation thereof would be quite expensive. So leave it out.

I had a bunch of conceptual revelations on how to build stuff. For a long time, it would go slow and I’d figure out some clever thing to do—“I know we’re doing extra work here.” Figuring out caching. My own education was kind of interesting. But that was ongoing; there was always something new that I learned every couple weeks. So I never really broke it up into large mile- stones. Getting the funding, working on it full-time, selling it—these were all big parts of it.

Constraints breed creativity. So now, instead of only having 15 min- utes two or three times a week, it would be more like, “I have the entire day to work on it, every day.” I don’t work in bursts like that. I do a little bit of work and then go wander around the city and come back. Then work all night. Once everyone has gone to sleep and it’s quiet, I can get a lot of work done. I didn’t really get to stay up late when I was at Morgan; I don’t really do it now. But dur- ing that I did, and I think it was incredibly productive. Probably very alienating to my wife though.

I released a bunch of projects—I’ve done a bunch more that are halfway done. I keep an idea journal of stuff. I make ideas and I work on them a bit to see what they feel like, and then I move along. One was called Bookbook—because I never came up with a name for it—in which you could say, “I’m at this location and I don’t want these books and I do want these other books.” You would put that in an XML file on your website, like a feed—you would provide a feed and other people would do this and create a central crossing engine that would say, “You have this book and he wants that book, and you are not that far from each other.” This was basically a distributed geomarket for books.

The problem was, the way I wrote it was fully decentralized. You didn’t log in and create your data; it was just, “Here’s a URL to my data” and the system would do the best it could. The problem is that it was so hard to use. You had to make an XML file. If that’s your beginning user interface proposition, you fail. I think 12 people signed up for it, maybe. The UI was too hard. The elegance of a distributed system trumps the usefulness of centralized UI and control.

Similarly, there was a system called Loaf that I did with Maciej Ceglowski that was a fully distributed social network—no central server whatsoever. It used email as a carrier and could tell people you talked to about other people you corresponded with in an encrypted and compressed way. If I emailed you, it would attach a Loaf file. You couldn’t open the Loaf file and read the contents of it; it just didn’t work that way. It used Bloom filter, so it was sort of a statisti- cal object. But you could take another email address and see if it was in there. With 99 percent accuracy, you could tell if someone was inside that file. So if you got email, you could say, “I think Joshua Schachter corresponds with this person.” Without me exposing my address book to you, you could tell who in your address book you talked to. It was a pretty neat idea, but it was compli- cated to install.

I was in USA Today in the late ’90s for Memepool, so it was always from there I got a great deal of press and sort of had early training. My father was the consumer advocate for the Long Island Railroad and was in the news- paper all the time, so I got training sort of that way. When this stuff started hap- pening, I knew that you have x messages and when you talk to the press, any question they ask is answered with one of the messages.

I understand talking to the press as an essential part of marketing. At the same time, I understand that the consumers are the best marketers. If they love your product and you give them the tools to market it, they will.

There’s a great deal of technology going on in New York City. In financial places, there is lots of high-end, high-speed transactional technology. There are a lot of good problems in finance. The technical problems faced there are hard. One issue is that there is a lot of money to be made there and the companies that are doing that pay. Some of the big brokerages pay a lot of money annually for their technology.

What surprised you most about having your own startup? It’s a combination of sudden freedom to run things as you please and crushing responsibility in which you know you have to do certain things in a certain way at a certain time. That eradicates all of that freedom. You become a robot on rails. You know what you have to do and you are working in a certain direction.

Maybe other people are different, but I think that every step was sort of the inevitable, inexorable progress due to the previous steps in the path. It’s not like I had no choice, but everything I did was the only choice because it was the only thing that made sense at the time. It’s not that long ago, but no regrets, that was the path to take. Everything that had to be done was done.

Reduce. Do as little as possible to get what you have to get done. Do less of it; get it done. If you’ve got two things that you want to put together, take away until they go together. Don’t add another thing. Because you can understand it better, you can analyze it more cleanly. The UI will be easier. Doing less is so important.
People often wind up adding features, adding stuff. Making it bigger is the typical way you engineer out of a problem, right? It’s the traditional, “I apolo- gize for the long letter. I didn’t have time to make it shorter.”

## Mark Fletcher Founder, ONElist, Bloglines

_Mark Fletcher was a senior software engineer for Sun Microsystems when he started ONElist, a free Internet email list service, in 1997. He ran ONElist as a side project until he received venture funding a year later. Yahoo acquired ONElist (later renamed eGroups) in June 2000. In 2003, Fletcher created Bloglines, a web-based news aggregation service. He originally wrote the program to manage his own bookmark list, but once he launched it publicly, Bloglines was fast on its way to becoming the most popular news aggregator on
the Internet. It was acquired by Ask Jeeves in February, 2005._

So I traveled around a lot, got really bored, and realized—I had been around computers all my life, that is really what I like doing, so why am I depriving myself of the fun of working on startups? It really came down to solving a need of mine. I had started another company—an anti-spam company—called Trustic, and that wasn’t going very far. But as I was starting that, I was doing this other thing on the side, which became Bloglines. I had a bookmark list of about 100 sites that I went to every day just to see if there was new stuff. Things like Slashdot, CNN, my friends’ blogs. It was taking a long time; I figured there had to be a better solution to this, and that’s how I found out about RSS. At that time, there were a couple of desktop-based aggregators—programs that you could download. But those weren’t really applicable to me because I’m on several different computers every day and the quality of the programs weren’t very good. With my back- ground of building server applications, it wasn’t a great leap to figure out that I should just build something for myself.

I started ONElist because I wanted to start a mailing list for my parents, and at that time you had to download software and you had to have a computer connected to the Internet. It was just really diffi- cult for an average person to put together a mailing list. So it was the same thing. I guess my advice is: solve a problem that you have, first and foremost, and chances are, other people may have the same problem.

Doing startups like this is so cheap that it just doesn’t require a lot of money. I think I put in a total of $200,000. And I didn’t do it nearly as smartly as I could have. I ended up buying all the computers. My recommendation would be: don’t buy any computers. Just use the virtual dedicated hosting services.

I just used the same company that I had set up for the anti-spam company. That’s why the official company name was Trustic. I thought, “I’ve already done the work to set up this company, so it’s just another product from it.” I was using the same lawyer that I had used with ONElist, who was a family friend.

We went online in late June of 2003. I guess the first thing is that we started getting press coverage almost immediately—and this is even before I brought in my marketing friends. There’s a newsletter called NTK, or Need to Know, and we got a big old blurb in that within 2 weeks or so. Then it kind of went from there.

The amazing thing about this company is that . . . I can show you the press binder and it’s literally this thick, for something that really a tiny percentage of people actually use.

I think we got really lucky because blogs in general started to become really big and the downturn was ending, so you had all of these people looking for the next big thing. Also a lot of reporters used Bloglines. They like to talk about things they use, so we got really fortunate in that regard. But there was no planning with that; it was just serendipity.

We were around for a year and a half before we were acquired, so it wasn’t very long. Because I was funding it myself, there was no big funding event that would be a milestone. It was kind of a gradual buildup throughout the entire time in terms of interest from the press, interest from venture capi- talists, interest from companies. So it got to the point where all the big compa- nies were talking to us. But that’s fairly typical of a lot of startups.

My philosophy on these types of companies—consumer-based Internet companies—is that you don’t need to worry about the business model initially. If you get users, then everything else follows. Basically any technology can be copied, any concept can be copied. In my opinion, what makes one of these companies valuable is the users. That can’t be copied.

When we started, there was only one service that was at even a close corollary and that was News is Free. When I was talking to reporters initially, they’d ask the same question, “What’s your competition?” It was basically the desktop aggregators, the programs you could download. We had a fairly good story around why we were better than that. Most people don’t want to install software on their computers. A lot of people can’t install software on their com- puters at work. A lot of people use multiple machines. We had several clear-cut advantages that were fairly easy to describe. About 6 months after we launched, I think NewsGator came out with their web-based aggregator, and were the closest competitor.

Some of the software design we carried over from ONElist to Bloglines, the
way the website was put together and how we scaled certain things. And cer- tainly some of the people. Everybody I worked with on Bloglines, I’d worked with at ONElist before. It felt like ONElist, version two.

We were growing so fast with ONElist—a percent-and-a-half a day for the first year or two. We had a million users at 11 months, which in ’98 was an amazing thing. We had horrible scaling problems the first year. We had lots of downtime because I didn’t know how to set up monitoring systems. I guess that’s one thing I did a lot better with Bloglines.

Did you have good relationships with your VCs? I guess the answers would be “no” and “yes.” As an entrepreneur, I’d never talked with VCs, I didn’t really know how VCs thought, so it was an edu- cation the whole time. I didn’t even have a mentor. No VCs were blogging. I didn’t know anybody who had started a company. I was just flying blind.

The great thing for entrepreneurs these days is that there is so much more information out there than there was in the ’90s. Any number of people that have gone through this are blogging. All sorts of VCs are blogging now. There are a lot more books out now. You can just do a search and find sample term sheets, for example. All things considered, I certainly can’t fault the outcome, but I made mistakes along the way.

The VCs did come in 2 weeks after we took the money and said they wanted to replace me as CEO, which was interesting. I was pretty wrapped up ego-wise with the company. When you start a company, it’s your life. So you think you are the only one that can run it. You think, if you’re not around, it will fall apart—or at least I did—for all of these things. It was very difficult for me to separate myself from the company in that way. So there was a fight over that for quite a while before I acquiesced, and we brought in a new CEO. It turned out that that was very good for the company and, had I been more mature, it would have been a less painful process.

During the whole funding process they said, “We’re interested in you guys because of your management team; we think you’re fantastic.” I’m on the phone with David Wetherell, head of CMGI, and he’s saying, “We’re making the investment because we believe in the management team.” Two weeks later they pull me into the office—before even the first board meeting—and say, “We want to replace you as CEO.”

Looking back, I can absolutely see why they would want to do that, because I was not a good negotiator with the term sheet and I’m sure they could see that. But I was so wrapped up in it at the time, it was very difficult. The good news is that we did bring in a new CEO, he did get us acquired by Yahoo, and things turned out wonderfully. So there are no complaints.

when we started looking at user behavior, the average user came back to the site 4 times a day for 12 page views each time, which is a huge number. Usually, the average user doesn’t come back to a given website more than one-half a time a day or something like that, so it was this incredibly high number of sessions and incredibly high number of page views. Whenever I quoted that to Bloglines users, they would say, “These numbers sound low to me. I go back ten times a day.” People were saying that this was one thing that had changed their use of the Internet, which is incredibly gratifying.

Startups are just so amazingly fun; they are so amazingly stressful. Whether you are an engineer or whether you are a founder, at least for me, it takes every emotion you’ve got and multi- plies it 100-fold. Higher highs, lower lows than any other work experience. A startup is all-encompassing, so do it when you are young and when you don’t have a family because you’ll lose it all.

With ONElist, we didn’t own machines until years into the company. We did the virtual dedicated hosting thing. So we had 40 or 50 machines at Digital Nation in Virginia, that we had never seen. Which is smarter. That was the biggest mistake I made at Bloglines—not doing exactly what I had done in the ’90s. Because when you do that, you don’t have to worry about buying switches, racking the damn machines or moving them when you run out of rack space. Or going down to the colo at 2 a.m. to reboot something because it crashed—all that gets taken care of. And these types of startups are never valued on the cap x, so you don’t get any more money in any sort of acquisition based on the number of machines you own. Unless you’re Google. So we had 40 or 50 machines at Bloglines when we were acquired, and that didn’t play a factor at all.Q

So just get something out there. If you find really early versions of ONElist or Bloglines on archive.org, the websites are horrible. They are crap, they don’t have any features, they just try to do one thing. And you just iterate because users are going to tell you what they want, and they’re your best feedback. It’s critical just to get something out quickly. Just to start shipping and then you can iterate. Because shipping is just this huge hurdle. I’ve been a part of companies that have had big problems shipping—they just can’t ship. It’s a psychological thing.

What would you tell a founder who just could not release new fea- tures and was overanalyzing everything? That it’s very easy to do, very understandable; but, in my opinion, the best thing for your company is just release early, release often. Because then you start a dialog with your users, because they’re going to send you emails say- ing, “This is what I want.” We were getting 50 to 100 emails a day at Bloglines, and most of them were feature suggestions. Once you start acting on those fea- ture suggestions, the users see that you are actually listening to them and they become more loyal to your site. Because they see they are able to participate in this and it’s just kind of like a virtual cycle. So it is not a disadvantage—it may even be an advantage—to ship without all your features initially, for that reason, because you get all of this going and you get out there sooner.

I guess it takes all types. When you say a technical guy, they can range from a hardcore nerd to somebody who has some product knowledge as well. I like to think I have a little bit of product knowledge, which helps me develop these websites. A lot of engineers don’t necessarily have that skill set, but they are better engineers than I am, so for those people, if they were to partner up with somebody who was a product designer, I think that probably helps out a lot.

But in terms of MBAs, these user-focused Internet companies aren’t very complicated business-wise, so until you actually build something that’s got users and has momentum, it’s not like you’re going to be doing biz dev deals or any- thing like that. Actually, I don’t have the greatest opinion of biz dev people for these companies because they’re just not needed, I don’t think. You either stand on your own or fail on your own, initially. If you build momentum, if you get users, then deals may come your way, but a lot of times most deals don’t make sense, so you don’t need hardcore MBAs. It’s more focusing on the prod- uct and engineering side.

If you are two guys in a garage and if you’ve been doing something for 6 months or a year and some- body offers you $5 million, it doesn’t sound very dumb to me. You can hire help for acquisitions, so with the Yahoo acquisition of eGroups, we had a board member, Mike Moritz, who was also on the board of Yahoo, so he was involved in that. With Bloglines, Ask was interested in us. We had talked with Google and Yahoo and some of the others, and things were getting interesting with Ask. I knew that I needed help negotiating any sort of deal. So at that point I brought in an investment banker.

The biggest question is when to sell. Even with ONElist, I had acqui- sition offers 4 months into the company. Offers by websites that no longer exist. So I dodged a bullet. With ONElist, we were growing so quickly that it was like a no-brainer that we just shouldn’t sell. And we didn’t really have much in the way of competition back then, so it was basically hang on for your life and see how long you can go. With Bloglines, we weren’t running nearly as fast as that. I was feeling there was competition coming. I do think we’re kind of in a bubble again to some degree. Not in terms of money flowing into all these companies, but certainly . . . somebody put out the canonical list of Web 2.0 companies, and I think every company has like 30 competitors now or something like that. So I was just starting to see some of that.

And actually, thinking back to this, all the press that we were receiving was wonderful, but it was also a double-edged sword. I remember thinking back then, “Just leave us alone and let us grow for a while more before you hype us.” You can’t complain about it, but . . . there was a stretch where we were in the Wall Street Journal four times in 6 months. With ONElist, we were never in the Wall Street Journal, ever. I was joking with my PR person saying, “So it’s been 2 weeks since we’ve been in the Wall Street Journal. When are we going to be in again?” And she said, “Don’t you dare expect this kind of stuff forever.”

There were differences. With Yahoo, I left at the acquisition, so I was never a part of Yahoo. With Ask, I stuck around for 14 months. Not that it was contingent on the acquisition in any way, it was just the right thing to do. If you compare the two companies . . . when eGroups was acquired by Yahoo, we were 150 people. I essentially hadn’t played in the code base in a year, I wasn’t running day-to-day operations, so it was very easy for me to go away. At the acquisition by Ask, there were two of us going over. It wouldn’t be right, regard- less of anything else, for me to leave. I wanted to make sure that the acquisition was viewed as a success for Ask 1 year later—5 years later, even. I’ve learned that your reputation is very important, as an entrepreneur, as a tech guy in the Valley, and it’s a good thing to worry about your reputation. I was very con- cerned about that, and so, when only two people are coming over—and most of the knowledge was still in my head—it wouldn’t have been right for me to leave. So that’s why I stuck around for a while, helped build up a team, made sure that the knowledge in my head was transferred to all of these other people, and that, when I did leave, the place wouldn’t fall apart.

Why do you start a company? Do you start a company to get rich? Do you start a company for the fun of it? That’s going to play into it also. And then, what’s your definition of rich, I suppose is another thing. It doesn’t take a lot of money to let you live without working ever again, if you do the numbers. So what are your goals in life? You have to think that through.

What other practical advice would you give to would-be founders? I guess, get a lawyer. With ONElist, I incorporated not using a lawyer. There’s a company in Delaware called the Company Corporation, so I created an LLC by myself before I had a lawyer. Then we went online and fixed things after the fact . . . it was a big hassle because VCs want a C-corp—any sort of investor generally wants a C-corp because that’s what they understand.

With Bloglines, I had an accountant, at least for a good part of it, who was fairly cheap. One of the hassles of ONElist was that I was the one managing the books the first year, as well as answering the 200 support emails every night, as well as doing all of this other stuff. I guess I’m torn with how cheap do you want to go with a startup. Having an accountant is kind of a nice frill.

ne of the things that I did do differently with Bloglines was rely upon an outsourcing site, in this case eLance, for a lot of things. Not a lot of coding, but other things. So, if I wanted to put together a presentation and I needed a couple of graphics, I put up a proposal on eLance and ended up working with some lady in Australia, who turned things around in 6 hours, for $50. So sites like that are so amazingly powerful, which is just one more reason why it’s really easy to do very small companies, because you don’t need a graphic designer necessarily.

 Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that? In most aspects of at least my fiscal life, I’m very conservative. I had a mortgage and didn’t want to take the leap of faith to do this without a salary, and so I started ONElist while I was still working full-time at Sun and did that for the first year.

 I remember my birthday that year. I got a phone call because the phone number registered in the ONElist domain was the second line in my town- house, and there was an answering machine on it. I remember getting woken up on my birthday that year by some guy saying, “I don’t know if you know this, but your site is down.” So I logged in, and our whole database machine had died, in Virginia. We were Digital Nation’s biggest customer and they didn’t really have much experience with these database machines we were using, so they were trying to figure out what was wrong. I had to call in sick from work. It was very stressful. We had scaling issues all summer; we had to turn off new user registrations for 3 months because we couldn’t handle the influx of people coming in—which is crazy, you’re not supposed to do that.

## Craig Newmark Founder, craigslist

_In 1995, Craig Newmark started an email list to pub- licize events in San Francisco. As “Craig’s List” grew in popularity, he switched from a mailing list to a website and added categories. Without consciously realizing it, he was about to take a big bite out of the classified ad business. Despite many opportunities to increase revenues, craigslist never compro-
mised the experience of its users. And because it is able to operate cheaply and let users do much of the work, craigslist has only about 20 employees—several orders of magnitude less than other top-ten sites. Though eBay purchased a 25 percent stake in the company from a former craigslist employee in 2004, craigslist remains a privately held company. It con- tinues to expand, and now has sites for over 300 cities worldwide._

It’s now been over 11 years. I don’t know exactly when I started craigslist. I do know that in ’94 I was at Charles Schwab and I was working with computer security and some other stuff. But my real contribution there was evangelizing the Internet—telling people that’s how the equity brokerage busi- ness would work someday.

In the middle of ’95, the CC listing broke and I had to give the thing a for- mal name and use a listserv. Somebody offered Majordomo and I was going to call it “SFEvents,” but the people who were calling it craigslist said, “Keep call- ing it that. It will signify that it will be personal and quirky.” They were right.

That’s a microcosm of our whole history: people would suggest things to me, and then I would figure out what seemed to make sense—what a lot of people were asking for—and then I’d do it. Even now, with a whole company behind it, we listen. We do stuff, we follow through, and then we listen more. What we do is almost 100 percent based on what people ask us to do.

The biggest entrepreneurial lesson I’ve learned has been that you really do need to follow your instincts. I trusted some people who my instincts were telling me were untrustworthy, and in some cases they proved to be very untrustworthy. But that’s fixed now.

I got lucky in that I realized relatively early that I’m not a good manager. Jim Buckmaster is CEO and he does a great job and that’s why my title is currently “Customer Service Rep and Founder.” Sometimes I exploit that George Costanza magic I have and I act in a glamorous figurehead role, where I’ll do public speaking or whatever. But I spend 40 hours a week or more doing cus- tomer service. I was doing that minutes ago. I’ll be doing so again in minutes. The biggest single project I have now is dealing with misbehaving apartment brokers—rental brokers in New York City.

The biggest problems are different forms of bait and switch, where they post an ad for an apartment in the no-fee section, but they actually charge a siz- able fee for renting it. The standard is 15 percent of a year’s rent, which can easily be $3,000 or $4,000. That’s a lot of money. So we can handle some forms of that. The bigger forms will require better forms of reporting, which I’m start- ing to think about, but which might not happen until later.

Sometime in late ’95 I realized that, “Hey, I have a lot of this email sitting in folders.” At this point, I think I’m operating on a Solaris system and I’m using Pine. I have email in several categories and I can write Perl code, which turns the email logs into web pages. So I had instant publishing. Everything has grown since that. I was, in fact, using Pine as my database tool until late ’99, at which point we switched to MySQL.

Through the first years, probably through ’98, it was mostly Solaris, although there was a period of maybe a year with Linux. But we used something in the UNIX/Linux family all the time. We used Apache relatively early. Perl, now more mod_perl. And MySQL since ’99. Now we’re running it on over 120 Linux servers—small, cheap machines. We’re primarily Linux on the desktop, with some Mac and some Windows.

At the end of ’97, we were getting about one million page views a month. At that point, Microsoft Sidewalk—or their PR people—approached me about running banner ads. I had decided to not do them, because they’d slow the site down and they were kind of dumb. Banner ads are, more often than not, kind of dumb. More importantly, I thought about my own values and I was thinking, “Hey, how much money do I need?” I was already doing well as a contractor. So I figured I would just not do that.

At that point, I got the first inkling of what I now call my “moral compass.” I better understood it later—particularly since the presidential elections, because then I realized that people were claiming a moral high ground who actually didn’t practice what they preached, and it’s about time for people of goodwill to reassert their idea of what’s right and what’s wrong.

In the ’98/’99 timeframe, we took a good look at the morality of charging for something. We asked people, “Hey, what do you think we should charge for, if anything?” And they said, “The principle is: charge people who would otherwise be paying more money for less effective ads.” They specifically said, “It’s cool to charge for job ads and to charge land- lords or apartment brokers.” Beyond that, there was some mix of opinion, but we stuck with that.

In the end of ’97, I was approached by some volunteers, and they said, “Hey, let’s run craigslist and see if we can run a nonprofit.” To make a long, painful story short, that effort failed. I kind of knew it was failing, probably mid- way through 1998, but I was in denial. A couple of our biggest job posters took me out for lunch and said, “Hey, this isn’t working. Get real and make this more serious.”

We have a really good culture of trust on the site—of goodwill. You know, we’re finding that pretty much everyone out there shares, more or less, the same moral compass as we do and as my personal one. People are good. There are some bad guys out there, but they are a very tiny minority and our community is self-policing. People want other people to play fair, and that works. That does mean a certain amount of our time, including mine, but that’s OK. Yes: flagging. Flagging works. By virtue of flagging, we’ve turned over control of our site, for the most part, on a day-to-day basis to the people who use the site. We need to figure out better ways of doing that; that’s still in process.

Was there ever a point when you said, “I don’t have the time for this”? Or were you always very committed? Always very committed. I’m stubborn. As I sometimes say, “I’m one very persistent nerd.” The problems I’ve had which got to me were the after-effects of some of the bad trust decisions I made.

The deal is, I did have some help, some favors; but, for the most part, for the first few years, it was just putting my own time and energy into it. If I was billing for my own hours, it would have been a great deal of money. But that doesn’t matter now.

We are doing well. Again, we are currently charging for less than 1 percent of the site. We started to charge for apartment rental listings in New York City, but we’re still basically free.

What advice would you give to someone thinking about starting a
startup? Trust your instincts and your moral compass. I’ve used that phrase too much in this conversation. The deal is: we’re not pious about this. We try hard not to be sanctimonious. This is the way people really live; we just don’t talk about it. I’d prefer to be cynical and not talk about it, and yet, that’s real life.

## Caterina Fake Cofounder, Flickr

_Caterina Fake started Ludicorp in the summer of 2002 with Stewart Butterfield and Jason Classon. The company’s first product, Game Neverending, was a massively multiplayer online game with real-time interaction through instant messaging (IM). In 2004, they added a new feature—a chat environment with photo sharing—which quickly surpassed Game Neverending itself in popularity. The team knew they were onto something big and put Game Neverending on hold to develop a new photo-sharing community site called Flickr. Flickr became extremely popular and was acquired by Yahoo in March 2005._

Stewart and I are married. When we met, I was living in San Francisco and he lived in Canada. One of his wooing strategies was to suggest that we start a company together. Both of us were doing web development at the time and his idea was that we do some type of transnational web development com- pany—which is kind of a harebrained scheme. We didn’t end up doing that, but we did fall in love and have a long-distance relationship. I eventually moved up to Vancouver and we got married. We went on our honeymoon and came back and two days later started Ludicorp.

Neopets was one of the inspirations for Game Neverending. It’s really fun. I was totally addicted. They have these pets, which are Tamagotchi-like, and you can buy them presents and give them toys. But what’s interesting is that it has a market and you can trade things with other people in the game. The little area that I cornered the market on was trading JubJub hats. My sister became completely absorbed in it, and we thought, “Wow, there’s something interesting here.”

At the beginning it was me, Stewart, and Jason Classon. Jason and Stewart had started a company together in 1999 that was acquired by a venture- backed startup out of Boston after about 6 to 9 months. Jason went and worked in Boston for a year and came back and then the three of us started working on the game together. I did the game design, Stewart did the interaction design, and Jason did the PHP for the prototype.

It was the three of us and we added Eric Costello very soon thereafter. Eric is a phenomenal web developer. He’s recognized as one of the great DHTML gurus. He lives in New York, so we were working with him remotely. If you have somebody who’s really fantastic and they live in New York, that’s OK. He likely wasn’t going to move (he has a family and is very settled there), but Eric
was a phenomenal addition to the team.

There are a lot of companies that are virtual companies—a bunch of people that are living in different places, but I think that’s tough. You can do it with one or two people, but I think for the most part, everybody being in the same place is important.

Stewart, Eric, and I had worked together on a project before, so we knew how to work with him remotely. The project was the 5K contest, which was a web development competition. It emerged out of a conversation that Stewart had with somebody at his web development agency who had said, “Oh, you can’t make anything worthwhile under 5K.”

We had a friend who was subletting a space, and he had a contract job that kept him out of the office all the time, so we sublet his subletted space. This was in 2002 and it was still in the great technology bust period. There were failed dot-coms all over the place, so office space was cheap. And some really awesome developers (like Eric) were available, who wouldn’t otherwise have been out on the open market two years earlier. So it was actually really well timed.

I think that the timing was really important because you could operate in a much more independent mode. The money was scarce, but I’m a big believer that constraints inspire creativity. The less money you have, the fewer people and resources you have, the more creative you have to become. I think that had a lot to do with why we were able to iterate and innovate so fast.

Flickr was kind of a lark. It was a side project that we built while we were in the process of building Game Neverending. The back-end development of the game fell really far behind the front-end development, and so while we were waiting for the back end to catch up—being restless hacker types—we built this sort of instant messenger application in which you could form little communi- ties and share objects. And we just added the ability to share photographs.

So Flickr started off as a feature. It wasn’t really a product. It was a kind of IM in which you could drag and drop photos onto people’s desktops and show them what you were looking at. We built it really fast; we had a lot of the tech- nology already from the game, but we built the first instance of Flickr in eight weeks. We had the idea in December and built it out by February and then pre- sented it at the O’Reilly Emerging Tech Conference.

The response was positive, but it didn’t end up being a compelling product mainly because it was a feature. It had a critical mass prob- lem. Unless all of your friends were already on it, the sharing feature wasn’t valuable to you.

Social networking got people used to this idea that they could make an online digital identity. They could put up photographs online and talk about who their friends were and what their interests were. And social networking as social networking pretty briskly showed itself to be a fairly pointless activity. People would go in and collect up all their friends and then there was nothing to do; there wasn’t any sort of core interest. But when you tied it to a very spe- cific, very connective activity like photo sharing, it really flourished.

We were extraordinarily fortunate in that the road was pretty smooth. The tide completely turned for us with Flickr. We’d been trying to get the game off the ground. Raising money for the game from outside investors had been really grueling. Raising money is very hard, especially in that market. We were building something that was not really known to people. If it wasn’t a shrink- wrapped game sold at Best Buy, they didn’t know what it was.

We did a small angel round, but we didn’t take any venture capital. And we lucked out and got an interest-free loan from the Canadian government. We’d applied for it, and gotten rejected, and then just sent the same application in again when it was open again, and much to our surprise, we got it. And here’s the other thing that was interesting about Flickr: almost immediately after we launched—even when we were just the IM client—we were being approached by potential acquirers. So it was clear that we were onto something. People really weren’t sure what yet, but there was definitely a lot of excitement and interest.

Why did you decide not to take venture capital? We didn’t think that we were ready, and we were kind of in a holding pattern. We weren’t sure we wanted to take venture capital at all. We were being approached by all the acquirers and VCs and still many angels who were willing to invest. We had enough money to carry us through six months into the future and we already had some great angel investors, includ- ing Esther Dyson and Reid Hoffman. So we didn’t feel we had to go for it. That was the ironic thing, because when you need money, nobody will return your calls. When you don’t need money and you say, “Sorry, guys, don’t need any money,” they can’t stop calling you. They just can’t help themselves.

At that point, we were almost at break-even in terms of our operating expenses. If we were to take venture capital, it would have been making a big bet, expanding rapidly, rather than growing organically. And we were already growing at such a fast rate, we were barely keeping up on the back end.

Tagging really revolutionized the way that the product behaved. Tagging is an incredibly simple concept: you just add a keyword to the photograph, and once it’s networked with all of these other people, you can see not only all the things that you’ve tagged (so it acts like this organizational system for yourself) but you can also see what everyone else in the system has tagged themselves in the public stuff.

The other thing that was happening was that people were creating groups for collaborative creativity and this was a completely different behavior for people. Photographs were being used in a completely different way. The best- known group of this kind is the Squared Circle group, in which people take a photograph of something circular, and then crop it to a square. It’s incredibly beautiful to watch in a slide show, as suns and manhole covers and dandelion globes melt into each other. People have made all kinds of creative groups, and giving people a forum and an audience for their creativity is a big part of Flickr.

Back when photographs were really expensive, they were like these iconic photographs. For example, my grandparents—there’s a picture of them that was taken in a studio. It’s very posed and it is this special photographic event. As cameras became more and more distributed, you would take photographs at weddings, birthdays, or events. But then digital photography really changed that because photos are totally inexpensive. You can take hundreds of photos and only save five. So people started taking more photographs, but sharing them became an increasing problem. Then, the next step in the evolution in the photograph was when it was attached to a delivery mechanism. A camera is now in a phone and you can send the photo immediately.

We may be the most boring startup that you interview for your book because our path was fairly smooth. There were times when we were really broke before we had our angel investment, when only one guy who had chil- dren was getting paid. One of the big risks of startups is that they’re inherently unstable. They don’t have an established business; they’re often trying to invent something new. They are relying entirely on investment and not on revenue.

In the beginning it was kind of tough because a lot of our skills over- lapped. Both of our backgrounds are in design. So in the beginning there was a lot of jockeying for position—who did what and who made which decisions. But once we were able to figure that out, it worked out really well. We have very complementary personalities: Stewart’s very improvisational and he likes to do things in a fairly loose manner, whereas I tend to be very directed and driven toward a goal. So in combination, he sort of loosens me up and I get him on a path and those two things work really well together.

There is a lot of institutionalized sexism working against women in busi- ness and I think that people aren’t even aware that it’s there. One example hap- pened when we went down to Silicon Valley to meet with a venture capital firm. After the meeting, the VC spoke to someone associated with our company and said to him, “Tell Stewart not to bring his wife to VC meetings.” Which was shocking to me, and Stewart was furious about this as well. He let everybody know, “Caterina is not ‘my wife.’ She is instrumental to the success of this com- pany. Her contributions have been equal to mine.”

## Brewster Kahle Founder, WAIS, Internet Archive, Alexa Internet

_Brewster Kahle started WAIS (Wide Area Information Servers) in the late ’80s while an employee of Thinking Machines. He left in 1993 to found WAIS, Inc. WAIS was one of the earliest forms of Internet search soft- ware. Developed before the Web, it was in some ways a predecessor to web search engines. Kahle sold WAIS to AOL in 1995. The next year, Kahle founded Alexa Internet with Bruce Gilliat. The Alexa toolbar tracked user brows- ing behavior and suggested related links using col- laborative filtering. Once captured, pages visited by
users would then be “donated” to the related nonprofit Internet Archive, to help build a history of the Web.
Alexa was acquired by Amazon in 1999. Kahle continues to run the Internet Archive._

Another lesson that I learned out of Thinking Machines was, if you’re trying to get your company to think differently—to do something interesting—pick your setting carefully. Thinking Machines was set in an 1800s Victorian mansion on 100 acres of forest just outside of Boston. It was a park, basically. Working in an environment where, if you got stuck, you’d go for a long walk is very different than trying to do a startup and think differently if you’re in Suite 201 in some major office complex. That was a lesson that I’ve used every startup since.

Thinking Machines had the great fortune of starting with $8 million in the bank, because some very rich individuals really believed in it. It was not venture-funded, and it was founded with the idea that it was going to take years and years and years to actually get something real done. That allowed Thinking Machines to attract a very interesting set of people. Richard Feynman worked there, Stephen Wolfram, Marvin Minsky. I found that I had better access to professors in a company than I did when I was in school. So that was an inter- esting way of trying to figure out, “What should the company do?”

The blessing of Thinking Machines and the curse of Thinking Machines was that it had a lot of money. If you have a lot of money, then you can be detached from people that are going to pay you in the future. Actually I really liked the discipline that came from a bootstrapped startup. I think that everybody that goes and does a startup—even if they don’t do a major startup that way—should start a business that is having to make people happy with them day one, through contracts, through small scale sales, what- ever it is. How low can you go? How can you build something really inexpen- sively? How can you not spend money on furniture and matching carpet and those sorts of things? The biggest thing that I probably didn’t do the second time around was have any money.

The best piece of advice that I got was from Bill Dunn, one of my mentors. He said, “Go someplace where people don’t think you’re crazy.” Which sounds like a pretty simple thing to say, but it actually turned out to be a very wise piece of advice. Boston, especially back in 1990/91, was in recession and having trouble. California was also in recession, but in California there were dreamers. There were people who wanted to think about new and different things and wouldn’t think we were crazy to try to build this thing.

One of the interesting ideas out of WAIS was its use of freeware and share- ware. This was a new idea, more or less. There had been some examples of freeware like GNU, but there were also mixed models: Kermit, where people basically would make source code available on the Net and sell something related. We gave away the client version, the equivalent of a Web browser. It was a WAIS browser and a server, so people could go and build their own system.

I don’t know if it was the first, but it was certainly early. We also found that people—even if we sold them the software—often didn’t know what to do with it. They wanted consulting services. We started what I think became the first web studio, or web services business. We worked with big players, whether they were newspapers or magazines, that wanted to publish on the Net. This allowed us to work with the big boys very early on.

Tell me about some of the most hair-raising moments. Going broke. When you just don’t have enough money to pay the bills. We would usually live with the amount of money in the bank that would be about 2 to 4 weeks worth of the bills. We’d never have more than that. If we got up to 2 or 3 months, we would think of ourselves as being flush. Living a boot- strap in a non-market—we’re trying to make a market go based on making servers in a client/server publishing environment based on the Internet, that people didn’t understand. So it was very difficult, but it was a good disciplining time.

Times that were really interesting? I think working with really great cus- tomers. It sort of sounds like a cliche, but to go and learn from Encyclopedia Britannica, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and try to learn how do they view their businesses and their lives was the most fun out of the whole experience.

What did you learn from your customers that surprised you? I love working with businesspeople because they are really straightfor- ward. But if you work with the actual businesspeople—not the lawyers that work for the businesspeople, but the businesspeople—they are very straightforward. They just want to make money. And they just want to make more money than they are making today. They understand there are going to be transitions and technology changes. So if you lay out a path of how they can make more money, potentially, at the end of this than before, then they are on board.

Having your own company means that it’s much harder to blame some- body else. If you are working inside a big company, you can always blame man- agement, marketing, engineering, or something. But, when you are running it, you can’t, because it’s all your responsibility. I found that to be quite cathartic. The East Coast also has a little more of an aesthetic of complaining, and so I got a little bit over that, I guess.

Alexa deleted things. Others that sort of followed in those footsteps aren’t deleting things. This is going to be a big problem. At Alexa, we started with a code of ethics in the whole approach, because we knew that we were gathering information that people often didn’t know that we were gathering, or they weren’t really conscious of it. Throwing away a lot of information is key in such a circumstance.

We couldn’t get the ad model to work worth a darn. Our idea was to give very contextual ads. We knew what web page people are on, might as well give them an ad that made sense. But we couldn’t find a way of selling ads in such a way that it worked. We had an unbelievable number of page turns. We had many opportunities to put ads in front of people, but we couldn’t turn that into making money.

So our underlying business idea failed. We were very successful in terms of getting lots of people to use it. People liked it. Netscape bundled it into their browser. Once Netscape bundled it into their browsers, getting Microsoft to bundle it into their browsers was easily done. (We found the best way to get Microsoft to do something was to get the competitor to do something.)

So we got lots and lots of users—millions, tens of millions of users—but we couldn’t figure out how to make the business work. At that point, when some folks from Amazon were looking around for data mining technology, they came and said, “Should we buy you for data mining technology?” And we said, “One, you shouldn’t buy us, and the other is that we’re doing something quite differ- ent from data mining. We have this toolbar we can get out there in front of people and things like that.”

In talks with Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, I said, “I tried being acquired, and it didn’t work. By AOL, a great company, but my company got dispersed, and I don’t know how to run a division; I know how to run a com- pany.” He said, “If we’re going to buy you, why don’t you run it as a company? What does that mean to you?” I said, “Well, it has a board, and I meet with the board once a month and they give general direction and I run the place.” And he said, “OK, let’s do it that way.”

So we got acquired, and we ran as a separate company. The company is still running. It’s about 200 yards away from the Internet Archive, which is where I am now. I stayed for 3 years and then moved over to build the Internet Archive—which had nobody working here—into a real organization. Because once we had enough materials, then we could build the library. So Alexa was about the cataloging of the library, and the Internet Archive is trying to build the stuff.

This was your dream? Yes. One thing I learned from Marvin Minsky (one of the founders of AI) was, “Pick a big enough project, something that’s really hard, something that over the years you can work on.” I’ve found that that has been a great guid- ing piece of wisdom. If you just set out to go and make a lot of money, then the problem is, what happens when you make a lot of money? You’re out of ideas.

How do you make a library such that everybody has access to every- thing? I remember talking to Richard Feynman, and we were looking at the Encyclopedia Britannica in one of these 1800s rooms at Thinking Machines.

We had an Encyclopedia Britannica, and it had an index that was one volume, then a micropedia, which was about 10 volumes, and then the next level was the macropedia, which was about 30 volumes. We just imagined: how many more layers of this before we have everything ever published? It turned out there were like 5 more layers, and I said, “That couldn’t be that hard. How much information is there? It’s not that much.” So even in the era of Thinking Machines, we knew what it was we were trying to build. It just takes longer than one thinks. That was 20 some odd years ago.

Most people don’t have mentors. They say, “Well, I’ve had influential teachers. I’ve learned a lot from this person.” But they don’t think of it as a mentor. A mentor is a life guide, somebody that you might work with, but somebody who is helpful toward watching bigger issues about things that guide your life. 

Oh, I think it’s much easier to do a startup on the West Coast. There are all the facilities and services available to you. You can put together a marketing department out of part-time people. You can hire an accountant to just do exactly what you need. You need a lot less infrastructure that you control to do a startup on the West Coast than on the East Coast.

If you started with $8 million, you can buy everything you need; but if you are starting, just you, you can do a startup out of your bedroom. In fact, a lot of people do. In fact, most bedrooms I think are startups! The idea that you can start on a shoestring, that you can hold a meeting in a coffeehouse and that’s OK, is perfectly legitimate on the West Coast.

San Francisco is full of dreamers. It’s the people with the new ideas. It may be bad, they may be inappropriate, they may fail, but I love the idea that we can do something new and different—something that hasn’t been done before, something that’s going to affect a lot of people. There’s an idea that you can pull something off here. That sort of uplifting nature to San Francisco and the Bay Area in general really lives on. This is a city of dreamers, and that’s what makes it just a wonderful place to live and to work.

Looking back on all of your experiences, what surprised you most? How long things take. To start a company and to get to a point where one has a critical mass—you have an office, you’ve got your CFO, you’ve got all of the infrastructure to become a viable entity. I think about 20 to 40 people is a golden size, because you’re not spending all of your time doing things that you’re not that good at. There are other people in the organization with more specialization in different areas. It takes a couple years to really get that debugged.

You can grow it instantly. You can hire 40 people in an afternoon, but they won’t necessarily work together well; they won’t understand what’s going on. It takes a while. So 6 months, 9 months goes by often just putting together all the pieces of infrastructure. With Alexa, it took a year to build the company to the extent where we could do our first real product release. WAIS was the same way. The first product release came a year after the start. It always seems like it should be much quicker than that.

What can big corporations do to preserve the startuppyness of the companies they acquire? My first company was bought by AOL, and what AOL wanted to do was inject the Internet into its veins. So they went around and bought a bunch of companies. And I’d say what they’d bought the company for, if I had been more worldly, they actually achieved. It just wasn’t what I was looking for. I had built a little company. It made something like $3 million a year, which I thought was pretty great. I wanted it to get to $10 million or $20 million, but that was a rounding error for AOL—it was noise. They needed us to help on the big issues. So I worked on strategy for the company for 12 months—to get the com- pany going in the Internet direction. And that’s really what they wanted. It just wasn’t something that I knew how to do. I really liked running something that I knew how to run.

When I did the startup that was bought by Amazon, I said, “Leave us on our own. We’re smart and independent enough to be able to do good work that will inject things from the side into your other organization.” The thing that Jeff Bezos did that I thought was very smart was that he ran us through his organi- zation and others through ours. He used us, at least for the first few years, as a think tank in some sense—a live and breathing example of how else they could do things.

Alexa’s major value in the first year of its being acquired by Amazon was to take some of the lessons that we had learned of how to do things much cheaper than they had. They had gone through an explosive growth phase, and they were spending $100 million a year on hardware. We couldn’t believe it. Here was this little company that had been living its whole life, and we hadn’t spent $10 million.

So Jeff said, “OK, Brewster, you know how to do this stuff cheaply. What should we do?” I said, “You should stop buying hardware. You’ve bought plenty.” He said, “OK, we’re going to stop buying hardware.” It caused enor- mous pain to their organization, but it was the right thing to do. They needed to become profitable. They learned a lot of lessons from this. They could use an outsider that was still inside. We were not as independent as a Bain Consultants or something like that, but we knew what we were talking about because we had actually built stuff. We dropped the cost of their Internet connections by 90 percent just by saying that you can go and negotiate deals in this and this way. So we paid for the acquisition of our company in the first year just by the capital costs that they saved.

## Charles Geschke Cofounder, Adobe Systems

_At Xerox PARC, Chuck Geschke and John Warnock developed a language called Interpress that would allow any computer to talk to any printer. When Xerox seemed slow to commercialize this technology, Geschke and Warnock started their own company, Adobe, to produce a successor of Interpress called PostScript. PostScript made it possible to describe complex documents in a simple form. In 1983, Adobe part- nered with Apple Computer to create Apple’s new LaserWriter printer. When it was introduced in 1985
it created the “desktop publishing” industry. Adobe went public in 1986 and is the recognized industry leader in graphics and desktop publishing software through its typefaces and its popular Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat appli- cations._

By the fall of 1977, in my office there, I had a personal computer with a bitmap display—oriented like a sheet of paper, not like a television set for the obvious Xerox reasons. I had a software program running on it that was as good as Microsoft Word—in fact it was developed by the fellow who left PARC and went to Microsoft and built the Office product line for them, Charles Simonyi. I had a great mail system on it that could mail to anybody in the ARPANET community, as well as within Xerox. It was on the precursor of the 3Com Ethernet technology, developed by Bob Metcalfe, who later left PARC and started 3Com. The network connected the personal computers to laser printers. We had a 60-page-a-minute black-and-white laser printer, a 10-page-a-minute color printer. We had a file server where you could store files and share them for projects. All of these computers were connected in both an internal and external network throughout Xerox Corporation and into the ARPANET, which was the precursor of the Internet. All of this was at Xerox PARC in 1977.

The body language of the Xerox exec- utives was to fold their arms over their chests, sort of stand back, look at this stuff, make some pithy remarks. If you’ve ever been in sales, you know that this is someone who doesn’t want to buy, is probably a little afraid of what he’s seeing because he doesn’t completely understand it, and hopes it goes away quickly.

Since this was a social event as well, everybody was invited to bring their spouses and significant others. I think all of those 250 executives were men at the time. Most of them had wives, many of whom had worked in offices. They loved this stuff. They sat down and played with the mouse, they changed a few things on the screen, they hit the print button and it looked the same on paper as it did on the screen. They said, “Wow, this is really cool. This would really change an office if it had this technology.”

We began to focus on the problem of how to take a variety of different printers—different speeds, different characteristics, some black-and-white, some color (we already knew about ink jet technology even though it wasn’t broadly available at the time)—how do you integrate that all so that any com- puter could talk to any printer? We did a project for Xerox called Interpress. It was actually the precursor of PostScript, which was the first technology devel- oped at Adobe. The idea was that you could build a network of printers and computers and they could all talk to one another.

We showed Interpress to Xerox management and they were extremely excited about it. They said, “We’re going to promote this as an internal standard that we’re going to use on all our products.” I said, “That’s fantastic. When can we start the marketing program to go out and talk to the world about that?” They said, “Oh, wait a minute. At Xerox it takes us at least 7 years to bring a product out.” I said, “7 years? In our industry, that’s two to three generations. This will be very old news by the time you get a product out, and the world will have passed us by.” “Sorry, that’s how fast we can get a product out and so that’s what we’re going to do.”

That made both John and me very frustrated. We were talking one day and he said, “I’m going to go and see if there’s a way that we can take our ideas and start our own business.” 

We said, “Fine.” So we wrote our business plan. John and I had managed enough projects that we knew what the costs would be to bring out a first prod- uct. We put that together in a plan, gave it to Bill, and he said, “Fine, you can quit your jobs.” We said, “We don’t exactly have the money yet.” He said, “You’ll have to trust me.” So John and I quit. Bill loaned us $50,000 just as a personal note so that we could go out and start leasing a Vax computer to do our work on. We eventually found the name Adobe Systems and we were in business.

Both John and I were in our early 40s. Maybe my kids were nervous that I wouldn’t be able to put them through college, but no, I really wasn’t nerv- ous because I knew I could get another great job, partly from the experience at PARC and from watching people in the venture world. I knew one founder who seemed to get more money every time one of his companies failed than the last time! You fail and people figure that you won’t make that set of mistakes the next time.

So I never really felt scared. The only thing that would have been hard to deal with would be the stigma of failing. But I thought we had a reasonable chance of succeeding.

The first thing we did was find a place, through a friend of John’s who sold commercial real estate. We got a place over in Mountain View, a few thousand square feet. We began talking to people about hiring them, and of course we talked to people we knew. Initially, most were currently at PARC or had recently been at PARC.

We called back Steve Jobs and he said, “Great! Sell me your company.” We said, “Steve, we’re not for sale.” He said, “Well, all right.” And basically he helped construct a proposal for how we would license him this software. We agreed on a royalty per printer. We also closed a deal shortly after that with Digital Equipment.

We began developing the laser printer for Apple, which eventually became the LaserWriter. We signed an agreement with Apple in December 1983, roughly a year after we went into business (we incorporated in December 1982). Unlike any startups that I’m aware of, we turned a profit within our first 12 months, as a result of that contract with Apple. So it’s a very atypical story. Steve did a prepayment on royalties to make sure we had the resources to stay in business, and Apple also bought a little less than 20 percent of the company, which quintupled the value of the original investors’ money. Steve wanted to make sure that we would finish this product, because it was critical for him that he have the LaserWriter.

By about the fall of 1984, we had the LaserWriter pretty well completed and we ran into a hiccup.   Steve had gone to his annual sales meeting in Hawaii with the senior sales management at Apple, and it was the first time that he really spent time talking to them about this new product, the LaserWriter. They all got very upset. They said, “We can’t possibly sell a printer that costs more than the computer!”

John and I called up Steve and we sat down with him and said, “This will be a disaster. You really have got to get this product out because it’s the only thing that’s going to differentiate you from IBM.” He agreed, and then he told us that RAM prices had just dipped again. So it didn’t matter what his salespeople said; he said, “I’m going to put this machine out.”

So he did, and it got a great deal of fanfare when it was introduced—people really loved it. There were industry analysts like Jonathan Seybold, who were very in touch with the publishing industry and were following computers’ influ- ence and the changes going on. As soon as he saw it, he completely got it and understood what was happening.

At the same time the LaserWriter was introduced, we introduced a piece of typesetting equipment, which was a full image setter, with Linotype Corporation, and announced that we had licensed the Linotype typeface library. It was extremely important for the publishing customers to know that they had the trade names of the original type vendors in the products and in the technology that we developed.

It turns out my grandfather and father were both letterpress photo engravers, and so I knew what it was like to work with the etching baths and the copper plates and all of the emulsions and everything. It was very toxic work, very expensive and very labor intensive. What we were beginning to demon- strate pretty early on was that you could do as good, if not better, quality using a computer and PostScript than you could with the old analog technologies.

Desktop publishing became very popular. For an investment of a few thou- sand dollars you could, in effect, be your own printer and publisher. So it opened up a whole lot of new businesses. As graphic artists and designers began to learn how to use a computer, we brought out products like Adobe Illustrator. All of a sudden, the whole industry began to move, and within less than a decade the entire printing and publishing industry went from the old analog world completely over to the digital world. That was a tremendous thing to see, and of course it was a huge benefit to us.

We came up with the idea of using a pure mathematical description of the outline of the type and then worked on some sophisticated algorithms about how to decide which bits to turn on and which ones not to turn on to give the highest-quality rendering on the particular device. That was really the breakthrough technology that differentiated PostScript from anything that pre- ceded it, including Interpress.

What were some other major turning points? Well, certainly if you remember back to that time in the office print- ing market, HP was in a very strong leadership position with the LaserJet. When we found out from HP that they wanted to come back and talk to us, that was a very important moment because we were, in fact, able to sign an agree- ment with HP and have them adopt PostScript on their LaserJet printers. That was a big coup for us as a company. It was at the same time that we managed to sign up IBM. So our strategy of not going to IBM early had paid off. Once they saw the market mushrooming for Apple, both IBM and HP decided they had to pay attention to it and that’s how we got those business deals.

The other lesson that we had to learn, though, is that you can’t be a one- product company. There’s a very high risk when you’re a single-product com- pany that eventually a combination of changes in the technological landscape and changes in the competitive landscape will eventually cause you to begin losing market share. And once you lose market share, then your revenue and earnings begin to fall.

On the LaserWriter, you could combine graphics and images and text in innovative ways that none of the application packages were enabling. More importantly, designers knew they wanted to be more creative but had no tools to enable their creative expression. But there was also another reason for developing Illustrator. John’s wife was a graphic designer, and once we brought out the LaserWriter, she wanted to get some of her design concepts out on that machine. So John was programming in PostScript by hand to get this output to come out and he said, “This is stupid. I need to build a tool that behaves more like what a graphic artist would expect to have in terms of pen and ink and drawing and so forth, and then let the tool write the PostScript code.” So that’s where Illustrator came from.

It was introduced in the winter of 1987. We also had been working with scanning equipment and photographs. Scanners were still very expensive at that time and so there wasn’t a lot of opportunity in the area of photography yet, but we instinctively knew it was going to come.

We were introduced to two brothers from Michigan: Tom and John Knoll. They had built a package that would let you work with a photographic image and change it, modify it, enhance it, do a variety of things. But of course it was doing that on a Macintosh with 512K of RAM, a little black-and-white monitor screen, no color, a disk drive that maybe held 10 or 20 megs. There were no dig- ital cameras and scanners cost $20,000. But the software looked really good. We thought that this had to be a great idea eventually and it was the missing com- ponent. There were applications that produced text. We had Illustrator, an application that could produce line art and drawings. But we didn’t have an application that could deal with photographs, even though the printer could print them. So we began investing in Photoshop, and we paid a lot of attention to the Japanese who were beginning to work on digital cameras and lower-cost scanners. We introduced Photoshop probably 2 or 3 years before the market was ready for it.

I am not a hunter, never have fired a gun, but I’m told that if you want to shoot a duck, you have to shoot where the duck is going to be, not where the duck is. It’s the same with introducing technology: if you’re only focused on the market today, by the time you introduce your solution to that problem, there’ll probably be several others already entrenched. It will be hard to dislodge them, and hard to convince people that what you have is so much better that they should make a change. Much better to figure out where the marketplace is going to be in a few years, focus on providing a solution to that, and let the mar- ket forces catch up to you. That’s what we did with Photoshop and it turned out to have been a great decision for us, and good for the Knoll brothers. It paid a lot of royalties for their work and developed a whole industry around digital cameras and digital photography.

We also had to fight the antibodies inside the company. When we intro- duced Illustrator, we realized that the profit margins were going to be very dif- ferent because we had to actually package the software, distribute it physically, build business relationships with a different sales channel—because when we sold PostScript, we sold directly to the major OEMs, so we literally only had tens of customers for PostScript. Now we had to get thousands and eventually millions. Very different business proposition, very different market, different sales channel. So there were a lot of people inside the company who said, “This is crazy. We’re going to invest all this money in this? What if it doesn’t work? We’re going to lose our profitability.”
John and I were convinced early on not only that you couldn’t restrict your- self to a single product, but you couldn’t restrict yourself to a single sales chan- nel to get your product to market either. Business relationships can eventually decay or fall apart and then you’re stuck. You have no way to get your products out and no way to respond to the market.

Did Adobe have any major relationships decay? he most famous one was in the fall of 1989. We had been working on technology to make high-quality text on the display, not just the printed page. Up until that time, all text on computer displays were bitmaps that were handcrafted. We wanted to be able to demonstrate that you could use the same technology on the screen that you used on the printed page. Apple had actually been working on that for a while. Their technology was called TrueType. We were trying to market our solution to Apple, not with a lot of success. By then Steve Jobs had left. He’d been the primary Adobe cham- pion inside Apple. Now Jean-Louis Gassée had taken over the product side of the business, and for whatever reason, Jean-Louis and Adobe never got along. So we were beginning to really have a problem with Apple. They were getting tired of paying us royalties for the LaserWriter; they thought that they shouldn’t have to pay anymore.

We decided that one way to deal with that would be to convince Microsoft that they should adopt our technology for Windows. In fact, we were able to get one of their biggest customers at the time, IBM, to agree to adopt our technol- ogy on both OS/2 and on their versions of Windows. But when we tried to sell it to Microsoft, we just couldn’t come to a business deal. The thing that was frus- trating is that it was already proven technology. We could demo it. And we already had all typeface licenses set up with the major vendors, so you knew that you would have that requirement satisfied, and, more importantly, we weren’t going to charge. We were trying to give our customers the same feeling on both Macintosh and Windows machines, so we wouldn’t be forcing them to make a decision about whose products to buy in order to use our technology. It had always been our strategy to be platform-neutral.

It came to a head at the Seybold Conference in San Francisco in September of 1989. Microsoft told us they weren’t going to license our technology and, in fact, that they were going to form an alliance with Apple. So our biggest cus- tomer and our biggest competitor got together on the stage, and Bill Gates announced that he was going with TrueType for Windows and that he had acquired a clone implementation of PostScript, which he would license to Apple so Apple would no longer have to pay royalties to Adobe. On the plat- form that morning were Gates, Steve Jobs talking about NeXT, and John Warnock (he and I used to alternate and he was the lucky guy who was on stage that year).

This quote has been repeated a lot because John spoke after Gates, and Gates had talked about how this was going to improve the world for publishing and printing—but they couldn’t even demo the technology at the time. John got up and he said, “I’ve never heard so much garbage mumbo jumbo in all my life.” And then he proceeded to talk about Adobe Type Manager (ATM) and what we were going to do. Once we learned the Apple-Microsoft alliance was going to happen, we decided that our only response would be to get to market immediately and to make ATM available on both the Apple and Microsoft plat- forms as an aftermarket product very inexpensively. I no longer remember the price, but it may have been $99, which at the time was considered very low- priced for software.

We sold hundreds of thousands of units in the first year, and it took Apple and Microsoft 3 years before they ever actually shipped a product. By then it was a moot point. During that time, Apple decided that they couldn’t build a product using a clone implementation, so they came back and redid the PostScript deal with us.

The thing that was really most important, as a startup—though by then we weren’t really a startup—by then we were public, but a young company—is the relationship that we had built with our customers. We wanted them to feel that a) they were given a decent deal and that b) they trusted us to lead them to where they needed to go.

So that reinforced a message that John and I had always preached inside the company about how to treat our customers. Listen to them very carefully. Understand what their requirements are and what their needs are. Not neces- sarily do what they asked us to do, but to have the vision to do more than they expected. We had worked religiously at that. We had indoctrinated in all of our employees that you treat a customer the way you’d like to be treated. That you are responsible for that customer’s success and, if you fail at your job, you may cause their business to fail.

They were mostly working on speculation of what they thought they could do. When we were talking to Microsoft and Apple about licensing this technology from us, we already had working prototypes. They were an example of what a poor duck hunter does. They were shooting at where we already were, and we were long past them by the time they were able to bring that product out. It became basically irrelevant to the market.

That’s what’s really cool. That’s when you know you’ve had an impact. I know I can speak for John on this too, but the biggest thrill is frankly not the financial success, it’s the ability to have an impact. Because we’re both engi- neers at heart and that’s every engineer’s dream—to build something that millions of people will use.

People with no training in the graphic arts could now develop materials that got a message across and did it more dramatically. I remember very early on, I gave a talk in Chicago somewhere—some guy in a small brokerage business somehow convinced me to give a talk. He said, “We use your stuff, but we always print it in Courier (which is the typewriter typeface) because people who see it printed in a high-quality typeface think it’s old news.” You see, he was on a cusp of a change. Now people don’t think about it that way, but in those days, if it didn’t come out in Courier, it must have gone to a printer and a type- setter and it must have taken 2 to 3 weeks to get prepared.

If you had a background in printing, did you create the products to purposely encourage good design?

I understood the difference between good and bad design. We also understood that, if you are in the hammer business, you can’t require that a per- son who buys a hammer be a good carpenter, so we opened up our tools to a much larger community. And some of the early printouts looked like ransom notes. People would put every available typeface on one page, which is not good design. So there was a lot of bad design going on. It wasn’t the fault of the technology; it was the fact that people were given a new medium from their point of view, as opposed to the professional’s point of view, and they were struggling to figure out how to do it well.

 think that’s gotten a lot better—not perfect, but better. More importantly, the people who are great designers have been given more creative freedom now. They can do things at a lower cost and faster than they ever could have before. A lot of design work now wouldn’t have been practical to try to do some other way using hand methods, but now with the ability to manipulate layers within photographs and do all this kind of really sophisticated kind of art, people can do design that they never could do before. What we believed in very strongly was that the rules of quality for what was produced were not set by the computer industry, but by the publishing industry. It didn’t matter whether or not some guy at IBM thought it looked good. What mattered was someone at Random House or Time-Life or Ogilvy & Mather or someone like that appreci- ated it.

I remember in the early days bringing home our first color separation work and showing it to my dad. He still had an engraver’s loupe. He pulled out his loupe and he looked at the halftone patterns and he looked up at me and said, “Not very good.” And I said, “I know, but it’s going to get better.” And then a few years later I brought home something that I knew was pretty good. I showed it to my dad and didn’t say much. He looked up with a big smile on his face and said, “Now that’s good.” That was a wonderful moment.

I don’t think there’s any mystery in running a business. I think it helped that we were in our 40s, that we had worked for a variety of organiza- tions. We had worked in other companies, but tried to leave their bad ideas as proprietary to them. We tried to pick the best things that we saw.

When we started, we wanted to build a company that we would like to work at and we kept applying that criterion. I remember, when we first hired people in the original days, John and I would take turns hand-delivering a dozen roses to the spouse if it was woman, a bottle of cognac if the spouse was a man, and then champagne to the employee.

Doing things like that to make people feel like they were part of a community helped build a rapport inside the company so that our turnover rate has been among the lowest in the Valley ever since we’ve been in business. Particularly with peo- ple who are the top performers, our turnover rate has been not only single digit, but typically 1 or 2 percent. And that’s because we’ve made it an interesting and rewarding place to work. So I get frustrated sometimes by people who have never run a business who are legislating things like stock option accounting and so on. They don’t have a clue of what it takes to run a business.

If you aren’t passionate about what you are going to do, don’t do it. Work smart and not long, because you need to preserve all of your life, not just your work life. One of the things that I felt really good about is that we—from the very first employees, including John and me—enabled telecommuting from day one. So everybody had a phone line and a modem and a terminal in their house, the day they joined the company. (Now, of course, they have their own personal computers and everything).

It’s devious, because I suspect we got a lot more hours of work out of them. It’s the same reason we give them a great lunch at a discount price.

## Ann Winblad Cofounder, Open Systems, Hummer Winblad

_In 1976, Ann Winblad started Open Systems, an accounting software company, with the help of $500 she borrowed from her brother. The advent of the microprocessor and the first affordable PCs created a new opportunity for programmers. Winblad was one of the first generation of entrepreneurs who figured out by trial and error what a software startup was. Six years later, she and her cofounders sold the company for over $15 million. In 1989, she cofounded Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, the first venture firm to focus exclusively on software. In the years since, 45 of its portfolio companies have been acquired or gone public. Now Winblad is probably the most powerful woman in venture capital._

They picked students with the top SAT scores and top grades as “experimental” stu- dents. As a result, I did not have to take any prerequisites, so it allowed me to take a lot more focused courseware than most students. I could do whatever I wanted. If you wanted to get in a class even though it was not your declared major, they would have to take you. In a liberal arts school at that time it was very hard to double major because, by the time you took all the prerequisites to lay the foundation for your liberal arts education, you only had time for one major. So I was able to double major in mathematics and business administra- tion and also fill in a whole bunch of other classes, like computer science and acting, that most students wouldn’t have.

I think what does separate some entrepreneurs from other entrepreneurs is we’re not handwringers. We don’t worry about the unknown. We don’t really worry about the risk points ahead. As you get older and you get more experi- ence, you train yourself to think ahead about the risk points versus just to take the next hill. But non–risk-takers and non-entrepreneurs would really have big headaches about this. They would need some level of comfort and safety.

We were overly thoughtful about what we would do. When it came down to “what special skills do we have,” we went back to that accounting class and in fact opened up my college accounting book and said, “Let’s start programming this from scratch and build accounting systems for smaller computers.”

Do you remember any major turning points? We were doing all this work for these CADO computer guys. And there were many things we didn’t know—like pricing strategy or how do you collect money from people? So I remember one very unsophisticated thing, in that we had been working with CADO and they said, “We’re going to get all of our resellers together. Since you’re the big application vendor, come and give a presentation and pitch them.”

So I get in front of these 60 or 70 guys and these guys are probably all in their 50s and I’m in my 20s, and we had a “blue light special,” where we said, “If you give me a check today for $10,000, you can have unlimited rights to one of our modules”—the general ledger or something like that. “But you have to write me a check today.”

These guys are looking at me like I’m goofy and I’m thinking, “Well, maybe they don’t believe this great offer.” (This is how naïve I am.) One guy says, “Well, we don’t carry our corporate checkbooks around.” And I go, “Well, you must have your personal checkbooks?” And they go, “Yeah.” And I’m thinking, “Oh yeah, how are they going to pay us?” So I said, “I’m sure your company will reimburse you and, if you want to, put a note not to cash the check until Monday, but I need the check today.” And the CADO guys are looking at me like, “OK, what is she doing?”

George Ryan was a great sales guy. The fact that he had this young girl there hustling software and so these guys are saying, “Well, we can’t write a check.” And I say, “Won’t your companies reimburse you?” I went home with, I think, like 12 or 15 of these $10,000 checks in my purse. For a young company, it felt like carrying gold around. We now have $120,000—all at one time! So that was pretty seminal . . . of course today, things like that wouldn’t work. It was a very unsophisticated market; we were their only choice. Probably, thinking back, half the guys wrote the check because they just wanted me to be successful.

I think this is something that people underestimate—that there are always people out there rooting for you. That is probably part of what you have to develop. They probably went back to their offices and said the following: “We got a great deal on this software and this great little company—I think those guys might be successful—called Open Systems. And this young woman got up there, and she had the balls—or stupidity—to ask us each to rip out checks for $10,000.”

You also learn how to optimize your time, and you get really good at that. You do it wrong—and I see entrepreneurs do this, “Let’s get up earlier and stay up later.” I started putting the stuff I needed to read in my bed so, when I’d wake up, it would be there to read, so I’d maximize my time. You’re young, and you are really sort of superhuman. But you are not very effi- cient doing that, so that’s where people who become your business colleagues start saying, “That’s not going to work.” That’s stuff that you do get help from friends and advisors. Like, “Hey, you are better off taking a month-long vaca- tion and turning stuff over and getting fully rested and charging at it again than trying to figure out how you might personally live off 4 hours of sleep a night forever.”

I think that I had all the good parts of a typical founder and all the bad parts of a typical founder. You get good at figuring things out so that you don’t just view every problem as if it needs a brand new lens, which, of course, it doesn’t. And you learn on the job, so you do a lot of things poorly. Unless you’ve managed people before, you don’t really know how to do that well. So you have to build skills. I think it’s really interesting being a venture capitalist because, when you’ve got 30 years of experience, then your challenge is how to teach and not tell. Because you want people to figure it out. You want to make sure that you can grab them by the coattails if they are falling off a cliff, but you want them to discover the edges by themselves.

You do learn that people get to be fully formed adults fairly early and it’s hard to change people’s behavior, although it is easy to cushion how they behave with people that buffer their weaknesses. As you go along, you get more micro- scopic in understanding people before you invest in them if you are going to sit on the board specifically. You can’t fully trust your judgment because some people are good actors, but it’s always interesting talking to people’s personal references.

What kind of mistakes do you see new entrepreneurs make? One of the big mistakes is that, when you form a company, there’s a difference between being an inventor and being entrepreneurial to leading a company—being the CEO or, especially, the leader. You’re not fending for yourself anymore. You’re actually fending for shareholders. And that jump to “It’s not about you; it’s really about a broader thing, the company, which broadly is the shareholders, which broadly is the customers, which broadly is the employees, which broadly is your mission, which broadly is the values you bring into the company.” There are some entre- preneurs that never really fully get out of the “me” thing. And that changes them from being the “inventor” entrepreneur to being the business leader entrepreneur.

## David Heinemeier Hansson Partner, 37signals

_David Heinemeier Hansson helped transform 37signals from a consulting company to a product company in early 2004. He wrote the company’s first product, Basecamp, an online project management tool. He also wrote companion products Backpack, Ta-da List, and Campfire. In July 2004, he released the layer of software that underlies these applications as an open source web development framework. Ruby on Rails has since become one of the most popular tools among web developers and won Heinemeier Hansson the Hacker
of the Year award at OSCON in 2005.
In July 2006 (after this interview), 37signals president Jason Fried
announced on the company’s blog that Jeff Bezos had made a minority private equity investment._

37signals was founded by Jason Fried as a web design shop in 1999. It transitioned from a consulting company to a product company with the creation of Basecamp. I’m part of the 37signals 2.0 management team.

While we were developing Basecamp, 37signals had a lot of client work, so we couldn’t dedi- cate more than about a third of our time to it. It wasn’t a client project; it was something that we created as an internal tool to help us manage our client work.

The idea came to us that blogging had been a pretty good way of distribut- ing information between people. I had been blogging personally on Loud Thinking and 37signals had Signal vs. Noise. So we wondered, what would hap- pen if you took that blogging idea and applied it to project management?

That was how we got started: the project blog was the first part of Basecamp that was made. We got it up in about a month and then we started using it to manage Basecamp itself. So it became self-contained very quickly in the sense that we were using Basecamp to build Basecamp.

As we showed it to colleagues in the industry, we quickly realized that others had the same problem; there was not a lot of software available for small companies to manage projects. Microsoft Project and the other heavyweight approaches to this relied on critical path management and things that might work fine for a 200-person project on a construction site, but not well for 3 peo- ple trying to deliver a web application.

The funny thing is that most people were impressed by all the stuff Basecamp didn’t do. They were used to these big, honking products that tried to do everything, where they just needed something simple.

We had this dilemma that either you had MS Project or you had email, and there’s a huge gap between them. Managing a project by sending emails back and forth is messy and doesn’t work, but otherwise you had to adapt your process to what’s mandated from these other heavyweight applications.

Basecamp was basically just trying to be one step above email. And by set- ting such a humble goal, we had to make a lot of decisions about how simple we could make things. We tried to make less software from the very beginning. It’s one of the mantras we have. It’s a win whenever we can get away with just a simple model, since we have to do less programming. I was the only program- mer and I was dedicating 10 hours a week to this, while we were developing it.

37signals was paying me to do this out of its consultancy revenue, since we didn’t have funds to fund it. So we had only a quarter of a programmer dedi- cated to the development and no funds really for doing this. The designers were giving it a third of their time at most. And we realized through this process that those constraints—which sound negative—were actually the greatest gift to the development of Basecamp.

It turns out that when you build only software that you absolutely need, you don’t get more software than you’ll actually use. And that’s why we didn’t fear competition from the big guys. If Microsoft decided to go after Basecamp, they’d say, “Get a team of 20 people to do this and we’ll give them 6 months to come up with something.” Because when you’re in a big corporate environ- ment, you throw a lot of resources at projects. You just could never arrive at the type of product that Basecamp is when you don’t work under constraints like we did. It’s just too tempting to try to do it all, or at least do too much.

It wasn’t necessarily that we were great programmers and designers, but because we embraced the constraints that forced that upon us. If we took the same people and put them in an environment where we had all the money and time we wanted, we couldn’t even make Basecamp again.

Did you worry about any competitive products? There have been a few businesses that have tried to do similar things, but most of them try to do the full management of projects: billing, time tracking, and other things that we’ve never tried to solve. We picked a few simple things: a project weblog, milestones tracking, file and to-do list sharing. And we haven’t really expanded beyond that; we’ve just tried to refine those few simple elements.

The funny thing is that another reason Basecamp is a success is because it’s not more focused. We started out wanting to make a tool for creative services businesses, like us. But we never actually wound up including things that were specific to creative services, like billing, time tracking, etc. So people use Basecamp for all kinds of projects, like managing weddings, home improve- ment projects, and student collaboration. The only reason that we’re attracting all those people who just need help with project management is because we’re not trying to be more specific.

As soon as they realize that they’d like to use it again on another project, there’s an upgrade path for them to go down. They can buy the first paid ver- sion that gives them three projects and gives them file uploading for $9 a month. So we have a shallow upgrading curve where you can go from paying nothing to paying very little. The most expensive version is only $99 a month. And because we charge on a monthly basis, customers get the advantages of low risk. People can sign up for two months, and if it’s not what they want, they can cancel easily. And that’s been one of the most powerful marketing tools.

Also, Signal vs. Noise had a fairly large following in the web development community. The first big market for Basecamp was these creative services firms. Since they were already reading about what 37signals was doing, we went the other way around: first we built the audience and then we figured out a product. We blogged about Basecamp even before its launch, making previews, and it was viral from there. So it helped that 37signals had a big audience and had an easy way of selling into that audience.

The majority of our new customers have heard about it from someone else or read something about it on the blog. They sign up for the free version and then, that’s the best lead you could ever get. It doesn’t cost us anything in the first place and doesn’t cost us that much to keep the lead, because, though they get one project for life, we have a large group of people who are now friendly to the product we’re selling because we just gave them something for free that they’re actually using. And we’re not yanking it away in 30 days. So this builds a lot of goodwill in the early phases of the relationship with the customer. It’s a really powerful way of selling.

Did anything go wrong? We got the launch pushed back by almost a month. Initially, we thought that we were going to bill people once a year, $99, $299, and $499 for the different plans. We built this entire billing system, which was a sizable amount of the development time. We didn’t figure out that the bank wouldn’t let us bill this way until about 3 days before we were ready to launch. The bank wouldn’t let us sell a service that we were going to promise for an entire year, because they’d be on the hook for the money if we went out of business a few months into a $500 agreement. They wouldn’t allow that because we didn’t have a long history with them.

So we pushed back the launch about a month, and now we charged monthly, but we charged twice as much. The plan that was before $99 a year is now $19 a month, $224 a year instead. So we actually got to raise the prices and at the same time create a less risky offer for small compa- nies since they didn’t have to buy a whole year.

One of the technical mistakes that we made early on was that we had this notion that Basecamp was for creative services firms. Set up like that, you have a firm and you have a client, so it’s a one-to-one relationship. That assumption went very deep. For instance, in the database there’s a client ID and firm ID, and now that people were using it, you’d have setups where people wanted two firms. So now what did we do? Basecamp simply couldn’t do that. And that assumption was so deep at the roots of the system that it took us about a year and a half to fix, which was not a good thing.

Another interesting mistake was that we didn’t consider time zones. Basecamp ran with the assumption for the longest time that everybody is in Central Standard Time, even though I was in Copenhagen, which is a 7-hour time difference from Chicago. So people in Australia would get their mile- stones one day late. We didn’t really care about time, because we didn’t usually have fixed deadlines. We had stuff we wanted to do, but it didn’t really matter whether it was 2 hours later or 2 hours earlier. Of course, not every firm works like that.

And it was also disguised by the fact that Basecamp didn’t use a lot of time. The only place where we displayed the time itself was on the comments. On the posts themselves, it just said the date and the milestone. So you wouldn’t be able to discover that, unless you were in that central time zone, it was off. In Denmark, for 7 hours after midnight, the system would say it was yesterday. So it was a big deal for the firms that needed specific times. And it was always a big deal to people in Australia. Half of the time they would be off by one day. We’ve gone back to fix that problem too.

I was until February 2005 when we brought on our second programmer. Yes, for well over a year, I was the only programmer and systems administrator on Basecamp. When you have to do a project like Basecamp and you only have 10 hours a week, you can’t spend your time on things that don’t pro- duce anything. So you get extremely aware of tools that aren’t necessarily help- ing your productivity and you go seeking tools that can help.

That’s how I found Ruby. It was such a nice experience for me and a nice productivity booster. I was coming from PHP. I had also looked at Java and other environments and I wasn’t finding anything else that would allow me, as a single programmer, to deliver all this stuff.

And I then built Rails on top of Ruby to allow me to build Basecamp and drive this project in the way that we wanted to. Because we didn’t want to bring on more programmers. We wanted to keep those constraints that we had and so we just had to make tools that allowed us to do that. And I think that’s also a big explanation for why Rails is having the success that it is: it was born in an envi- ronment that was so focused on productivity and was so focused on being able to deliver within constraints. I’m building Rails while I’m building Basecamp— rather, I’m building Basecamp, and every step of the way, I’m extracting Rails.

When we launched Basecamp, it was 4,000 lines of code—so not very much. One guy who’s now involved with Rails told me that they had a single configuration file in XML that was 5,000 lines!

We released Basecamp in February 2005, and by then I knew that I wanted to release Rails. We went through the hectic time after releasing Basecamp where we would keep on pushing a whole bunch of new features.

We always give a major update within 30 days after we launch a new prod- uct. Because that’s really something that reinforces people’s feelings about the project. If they buy in on day one and then they see a major new update after 2 weeks, they’re really pleased. So for us, one of the secrets about how we mar- ket the product is to make sure that launch is not the end. We don’t say, “Whew, we’re done now,” and then go on vacation. It’s then when you keep on pushing to show this product is alive.

Sometimes, but whenever we had those feelings we viewed them as clues that we were trying to do too much, so we’d think, “How could we make this feature require less engineering and programming?” And we got into a pretty good mode that, whenever we wanted to do something new, we would brainstorm some ideas and try to look for the idea that required the least amount of work.

And I had this same thing in the development of Rails. When you try to do 100 percent of what somebody wants, you need a perfect match, and it’s pretty rare that you have a perfect match between what you thought people needed and what they actually need. If you just try instead to do 80 percent of what they need, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll hit a sweet spot.

So Rails is really about trying to get that 80 percent all the time and not really caring about those last 20 percent that are really specific to the situation that you’re in. When Rails launched, it was just 1,000 lines of code. So even though we’ve done all these things, there’s no superhuman strength involved. We aren’t producing more lines of software than everybody else; we’re just making each line count for so much more.

So, much of your innovation was driven by your own needs, rather than your clients’ requests?

ery much so. It’s good to be market-driven in the sense that you should know what’s going on, but you can’t let your customers drive your product development. You need to be able to innovate on behalf of your customers, but they often don’t know what they want. And it’s the same thing for programmers. If you went around and asked them what they wanted in a framework, you wouldn’t get a good product out of that. You need to be able to source input from a lot of sources, and then have your vision of what it’s going to be and then drive that.

You need to drive both framework development and product development with a strong vision, where you’re not afraid to turn somebody off. We’re not afraid to say to a customer, “Maybe Basecamp is not for you. If you want those five things, maybe you should go look for something else.”

So we have definitely said to ourselves, “We don’t want any outside money. We actually don’t even want to grow our team.” We’re trying to design our products in a way that they can scale with more users without us having to scale as a company. So, through Signal vs. Noise, we’re trying to deliver a pushback to companies that feel like they have to hire a bunch of people as early as possible and to take money to realize their vision by saying, “If your vision of your prod- uct costs a million bucks to make, try rescoping that idea in your head so it fits in $100K and get it out there earlier. Instead of having a 1-year product cycle, what could you do in 1 month?”

 think I’m fairly surprised that we’ve been able to stay true to our initial values. Since we launched Basecamp, we’ve added only one more person, even though the product has grown like crazy. I’m definitely sur- prised that we’ve been able to grow and not write a whole lot of software, and still make a difference.

We view it as advantageous actually, because the 7-hour time difference leads to “alone” time. In a company where everyone is in the same place, it’s very easy to walk down the hall and interrupt somebody. If you’re part of a distributed team that’s 7 hours off, you’re bound to have a good portion of the day where you just get work done. There are no interruptions.

## Philip Greenspun Cofounder, ArsDigita

_Philip Greenspun founded ArsDigita in 1997. Though the company lasted only a few years, ArsDigita is famous in the startup world both as the embodiment of a new model for software consulting and as an all-too-colorful example of the dangers of venture capital. ArsDigita grew out of the software that Greenspun wrote for managing photo.net, a popular photography site. He released the soft- ware under an open source license and was soon deluged by requests from big companies for custom features. He and some friends founded ArsDigita in 1997 to take on such con- sulting projects. Greenspun and his cofounders fostered a great sense of loyalty among users and employees. Like Google later, ArsDigita created an environment in which programmers reigned supreme. The company grew fast, and by 2000 was gen- erating about $20 million in annual revenue from its monthly service contracts. 

That same year, ArsDigita took $38 million from venture capitalists. Within weeks of the deal closing, conflict arose between the new investors and the founders. They marginalized and then fired most of the founders, who responded by retaking control of the company using a loophole the VCs had overlooked. The legal battle culminated in Greenspun’s being bought out, and a few months later the company crashed. ArsDigita was dissolved in 2002, but not before establishing an important new model for the consulting business._

I started building Internet applications in the early 1980s. I always liked multiuser applications, and I thought connecting people over the network—if they were separated in space and time—was just going to be the best usage of computer systems.

Then the Web came along in the early ’90s and, as soon as I saw it, I said, “OK, this is how all computer applications are going to be built in the future. I don’t need to write all this custom code to the operating system anymore. I’ll just build something that is specified on the server side, and the user experi- ence will be rendered by the browser. It will have a simpler user interface, but it will be guaranteed to work on any kind of computer, and it will survive changes in operating systems.” It pretty much has; I have plenty of web pages that I built in 1993, and here in 2006 people can still grab them, even though there have been a lot of changes in computer operating systems and software.

So I went away for the summer—a driving trip to Alaska. I wrote a book chapter every week, but really it was a letter to my friends and family so that I would get interesting email back from them. I’d email it to my friends and family to spur their thinking and let them email back to me.

When I got back, I decided that I would stick these emails into HTML and scan the photos that I had given as a face-to-face slideshow and put them on a website so that my friends in California could see them.

The book was called Travels with Samantha. Samantha was my old laptop computer (I was in between dogs at the time). This book was pretty popular, but most of the questions that I got about it had to do with photography. I thought, “I’ll write up a couple of short tutorials on photography and then I won’t have to keep emailing answers to these questions one by one. But pho- tography is open-ended; if you answer three questions, you raise five more. So I thought I’d build a question and answer forum on my server, and when some- one asked me a question and I answered, it would be a public exchange, and then the next person who came to my site would see that public exchange, and if they had a similar question, they wouldn’t post it again.

Pretty quickly I found that one reader would ask a question and then a sec- ond reader would answer it. I wasn’t having to do anything at all. Things took on a life of their own and voila: an online community of photographers was born. I began to write more and more software to make this community easy to manage, and I was doing it all myself. Eventually I had this big toolkit of soft- ware that I had written for my own purposes.

This was in the mid ’90s, and I noticed that other web publishers were try- ing to build similar things where people would come register at the site and exchange information and maybe go and try to buy something. The stuff was just broken. People’s sites were down. They had bugs. If you tried to buy some- thing, you’d get halfway through the checkout process and you’d get a server error. I thought, “All these people don’t even have the fundamental ideas of how to put the server together, and we could just tell them, ‘Look, this is how a medium-volume online community can be run off of a computer that’s medium sized. You don’t need a huge server farm. You don’t need ten full-time sys admins.’ We’ll give them a data model of table definitions in SQL (we hap- pened to use the Oracle database, which was the best one available at the time). We’ll create some web scripts that talk to Oracle’s data model, and they can modify it to suit their needs. It will start from our proven working core of an application and it will save them a lot of time.”

SAP was a popular toolkit for building corporate accounting systems, and I would say, “This is like SAP, but for building an Internet application or an online community.” I started by giving away my software. I just tried to docu- ment it and make it as general as possible and easy to install and stuck it on my website as a free open source thing. We gave it a name: the ArsDigita Community System. A kid I worked with thought it was a good name.

Then big companies started calling, and they’d say, “We like your system, but we need ten extra features.” And I’d say, “Great. You have the source code and the documentation. Good luck.” They’d say, “We want you to make the changes.” I’d say, “Well, I’m busy. I need to finish my PhD. And it would take me 2 weeks to do it.” They’d say, “No, we really need you to do it.” “How many programmers do you have in your IT department?” “Ten thousand.” “Well, if you’ve got ten thousand programmers and I’m just one guy, why do you want me to make the changes?” They’d say, “We’ll pay you $100,000.” “You’ll give me $100,000 for 2 weeks of work?” “Yes, we just need this system up and running now.”

After a few of those calls, some of my friends and I decided that we’d band together and have a little company to do support and service. I didn’t want any overhead, so I thought, “Let’s just have companies hire us as individuals and pay us directly, and nobody will be taking a profit off of anybody else’s labor.”

Right around the same time a friend of mine, Elsa Dorfman, the photo- grapher, asked if I knew anyone who would rent her house. I said, “How would you feel about renting it to a little group of programmers, and we’ll use it as a company office?” She agreed.

So we moved into Elsa’s house, and once you’ve gotten an office and you have customers, things kind of take on a life of their own. The toolkit got more and more popular, and we amazed the customers. Most computer program- mers don’t listen to what the customer wants. They have their own ideas of what would be cool, so they spend a lot of time building stuff that the customer doesn’t want. They don’t have an investment in the user experience.

A friend of mine was just telling me the other day that his company off- shored a product design to India, and said, “These programmers in India, they did exactly what we told them, no matter how ridiculous!” Most programmers don’t think about the user experience. They get a spec book, and they say, “Well, I’m going to meet this spec to make the customer happy.” That’s not really enough; you have to make something good for the user if you want to call yourself an engineer.

The third element is just meeting the deadlines. If we’d said we were going to do something by a certain date, we did it, and the customers were stunned.

Well, in response to people downloading the software. They weren’t really interested in photo.net, but they had decided to adopt our soft- ware toolkit. In some cases, they’d heard from Edward Tufte in his lectures. People would ask, “What’s good on the Web?” and he’d say, “Nothing’s good on the Web,” and they’d say, “C’mon, give us two good websites.” And one of the ones he’d mention would be photo.net as an example with good design.

What was unique about ArsDigita? We tried to help each programmer develop an independent, pro- fessional reputation. We had this idea that programmers could be professionals, like doctors or lawyers, and, to that end, we wanted the programmers to be real engineers—to sit down face to face with the customer, find out what was needed, come up with some suggestions or changes based on the programmer’s experience with similar services, and then take a lot of responsibility for making it happen.

What were some of the biggest turning points? One big turning point was getting Levi Strauss as a customer. They had acquired a small company that made custom-cut khaki pants, and they wanted a web front end for this new factory that they were building that could take your measurements and sew you a pair of khakis to your specs. They asked around MIT, “Who’s really an expert on building this kind of thing?” They came to us and it was a happy coincidence, because they were happy to pay for lots of software and infrastructure and tools and let us keep the rights to it all.

That was one good thing about working for non-technical companies. If you worked for IBM, they make their money by owning technologies, so if you build a technology for them, they want to own it. Whereas publishers or cloth- ing companies, they make their money by having a brand or unique content. I did a lot of work for Hearst Corporation and they don’t want to give away the content of Cosmo magazine or their relationship with Fabio, but if you build some Perl scripts for them to do server administration, it doesn’t occur to them that that’s something that they have to own and prevent other publishers from getting hold of.

So Levi’s was a great client and it was a big turning point because it gave us the money to build whatever we needed to build.

Another turning point was in 1998 when I published Database Backed Web Sites. We were working on a site and the client said, “You have to finish this site for us, because as soon as the book comes out, your phone is going to be ringing off the hook.” I didn’t believe him, but he was right, and that was a huge turn- ing point. It was on my website for free, but having a hard copy in the stores gave it a bit more credibility and more readers.

That was pretty much always how we built the business—tutorial publica- tions on our website, books in bookstores, and public lectures. Edward Tufte gave us this idea of having a one-day seminar that people would come to and learn. We would get 400 people to come to a free, one-day course, and then maybe 1 or 2 would become customers and maybe 10 of them would adopt the software.

Almost all of our marketing and sales was educational. We just thought, “We’ll teach people stuff, and some tiny fraction of those people will become our customers.” It seemed to work just as well as running ads, which were a hard sell and kind of empty and a waste of people’s time. In this case, nobody could ever say that we wasted their time. I think the same percentage of people that read an ad in ComputerWorld magazine and bought something would read one of our tutorials and buy something from us.

People used to say, “Why should we pay you guys $30,000 to $50,000 a month to do this thing, when we can just hire our own programmer?” What I would tell them is, “Each company has one class of stars. In some com- panies maybe it’s the salespeople, and in some companies maybe it’s the mechanical engineers. There’s going to be one class of people for whom it’s really easy to hire more people like that.” Hospitals are a good example. If it’s a good hospital, the doctors will be good, and it’s very easy for them to hire good doctors. But it’s hard for them to hire any other kind of person. Hospitals don’t have really good advertising people; those people want to work on Madison Avenue.

So we would say, “You’re a very capable person, and you’re going to have a very easy time hiring people like yourself. We don’t know your business and we’d have a hard time hiring someone like you, but we have a very easy time hiring someone like me, who’s an MIT-trained computer science nerd. It’s cheaper for you to use us, because we have really great programmers, and great programmers are a lot cheaper than mediocre programmers. So even if you give us a profit margin, it’s still cheaper than doing it internally.”

Tell me a little about the competitive landscape. There was Broadvision. Believe it or not, people didn’t agree back then on how you did websites. Today, everybody would pretty much agree that the right thing to do is to do whatever Bill Gates or Microsoft says. So you download SQL Server, Visual Studio .NET, and you have a two-tiered system where you have a data model and SQL Server and you have scripts and a script- ing language talking to the database. You don’t have a lot of elaborate compila- tion steps. If you change a script, it’s written in C# or Visual Basic; the next time you load it, a new definition will be evaluated. Very lightweight programming environment. Most of the engineering is in the database.

That’s how I started doing things in 1994, but there were lots of companies trying to convince people that that wasn’t adequate; that you had to have some- thing really complicated. They would say, “What you really need is lots of layers and application servers and you need our software. You don’t just download Perl and Apache. You have to buy our system for a million dollars.” Broadvision was almost comically difficult to use. It required people to program their web pages in the C++ language, which even a lot of professional programmers find impossible to use. Modifying a website became just as expensive and difficult as it would be to make a change to Microsoft Word, and Microsoft itself is only able to get out a new version every few years.

There was also a company called Vignette, and they had a really bad prod- uct. They had a product that let you program web pages in Tcl, which was a scripting language. But there were free open source tools that were better and let you do the same thing. Why would anybody pay for this? But they were selling it. They had hundreds of millions of dollars from their IPO, and we thought, “These companies can’t just waste all their money forever.”

One thing that we did which enabled us to be much, much faster than our competitors was that we developed on and released our software from running real-world systems. For example, we would install our release of software on photo.net or on the ArsDigita.com site where the employees and customers were all using it. We picked one site which was a public, well-used website, and we put all our new features on there. If there was a page that was very slow because the SQL query hadn’t been tuned properly, we would find out imme- diately. If there was a user interface that was clumsy and confused the cus- tomers, say on the photo.net classifieds, well, 100 classified ads were being posted every day and people would email us saying, “We can’t figure this out.”

Then, after a couple weeks of testing the new release on this running service, we would just tar it up in the UNIX file system and produce a distribu- tion, and that was it. We couldn’t guarantee that this toolkit would solve all the world’s problems, but we could guarantee, at least for something sort of like photo.net on a medium-sized server with a few hundred thousand registered users, that the software would be adequate in performance and adequate in features. It wouldn’t be too expensive to support administratively because the user interface wasn’t confusing people.

If you don’t have any way of seeing how your customers are using the soft- ware except by shipping them the CD and then standing in the back of their living room while they type, maybe this is a reasonable way to develop software. But if you have the capacity to just install it on the server and essentially look over their shoulders by looking at the web server log and seeing what kind of complaints they email to the help desk or the website, then why not do that? You can shortcut the whole 2-year development cycle down to maybe 2 months. We would have releases every 2 or 3 months.

If you look at a book on how to develop software, it will always have this long cycle with all these people involved. It’s very slow because it’s predicated on the fact that you can’t just watch people as they use your run- ning system—which you can do on the Web. 

That was part of it; it was hard to hire people. No matter what you did, most of the people with really good credentials and experience were occu- pied. There was so much money chasing a relatively limited talent pool. The folks who were in their 30s were simply not available. They were tied up work- ing at their own startups. So we thought, “OK, how are we going to hire and grow people?”

For programmers, I had a vision—partly because I had been teaching pro- grammers at MIT—that I didn’t like the way that programmer careers turned out. Programmers are isolated. They sit in their cubicle; they don’t think about the larger picture. To my mind, a programmer is not an engineer, because an engineer is somebody who starts with a social problem that an organization or a society has and says, “OK, here’s this problem that we have— how can we solve it?” The engineer comes up with a clever, cost-effective solu- tion to address that problem, builds it, tests it to make sure it solves the problem. That’s engineering. If you look at civil engineers, architects, they’re all dealing directly with the customer and going through the whole process.

The programmers were in the corner doing what they were told. That’s one reason they were so easy to outsource. If a programmer really never talks to the customer, never thinks, just solves little puzzles, well, that’s a perfect candidate for something to offshore. So I said, “I don’t want my students to end up like this. I want them to be able to sit at the table with decision-makers and be real engineers—to be able to sit with the publisher of an online community or an e-commerce site and say, ‘OK, I’ve looked at your business and your goals; here are some ideas that we can bring in from these 10 other sites that I built, these 100 other sites that I’ve used.’ And be an equal partner in the design, not just a coder.”

I wanted to grow people into being able to do that, and I thought, “Let’s try to make these people true professionals in the sense that lawyers and doctors and real engineers like civil engineers are professionals.”

They would have to develop the skill of starting from the problem. They would invest some time in writing up their results. I was very careful about trying to encourage these people to have an independent professional reputation, so there’s code that had their name on it and that they took respon- sibility for, documentation that explained what problem they were trying to solve, what alternatives they considered, what the strengths and limitations of this particular implementation that they were releasing were, maybe a white paper on what lessons they learned from a project. I tried to get the program- mers to write, which they didn’t want to do. 

People don’t like to write. It’s hard. The people who were really good soft- ware engineers were usually great writers; they had tremendous ability to organize their thoughts and communicate. The people who were sort of average-quality programmers and had trouble thinking about the larger picture were the ones who couldn’t write.

You had a different atmosphere, such as encouraging your people to be part of the process. Didn’t you also have educational sessions? Yeah, and we had very strict code reviews. Basically the whole idea was to grow the company by having apprentices. We would bring in some people, and then the handful of people who were already there would work with them and review their code and show them how to do things more cleanly—how to use features of the toolkit instead of writing extra software. The idea was that, once they had done two or three projects for customers, they could take on an apprentice and mentor that person.

When they’re young, people need to work pretty long hours to build experi- ence and get things done. But the benefit was that then they get a big chunk of the project, and they are able to say, “I built half of the site for the customer.” They put their name on something, instead of their résumé just saying that they were part of a 20-person team.

You never really know what most programmers have accomplished. There are a handful of people that you can say that about. Linus Torvalds built the Linux kernel, but it’s hard to say what the average programmer working at a big company has ever accomplished. Maybe he or she knows, but, from the out- side, the projects are so big and their contributions were so small.

I wanted them to have a real professional résumé. In the end, the project was a failure because the industry trends moved away from that. People don’t want programmers to be professionals; they want programmers to be cheap. They want them to be using inefficient tools like C and Java. They just want to get them in India and pay as little as possible. But I think part of the hostility of industrial managers toward programmers comes from the fact that program- mers never had been professionals.

Programmers have not been professionals because they haven’t really cared about quality. How many programmers have you asked, “Is this the right way to do things? Is this going to be good for the users?” They reply, “I don’t know and I don’t care. I get paid, I have my cubicle, and the air-conditioning is set at the right temperature. I’m happy as long as the paycheck comes in.”

It’s no surprise that programmers’ salaries are headed down to what an ille- gal immigrant working at a slaughterhouse in Nebraska would get paid, because they just don’t think about if they are doing high-quality work for the end users. I think because of that, managers have said, “I’m tired of these people. I don’t want to see them. I haven’t had a good experience. They’ve been late, they haven’t done what they’ve promised, and what they’ve done has been bug- ridden and not very good for the end user. So if I can’t have a good experience with these people, then I’ll just get rid of them. I’ll have them in India or China where I can’t see them and they won’t get on my nerves as much.” So I think there’s an emotional component to why programmers are being offshored: it’s simply that the businesspeople hate them.

ou ran a tough ship, but you were trying to empower them? eah, but they didn’t appreciate it that much. Some of the early people did, but the later arrivals, when the venture capitalists came in and said, “Oh, you guys should just clock out at 5 p.m. and you shouldn’t write, because programmers shouldn’t have to do more than code,” they were so happy that they didn’t have to work hard anymore. “We don’t have people like Philip and Jin reviewing our code and telling us to redo it to be cleaner and simpler.” They were so happy to be relieved of those strictures that they very quickly lapsed. Not everyone, of course, but the majority. We built the company a little too fast, and consequently the last 50 percent of the people hired really didn’t have much commitment to the corporate culture.

There were some warning signs. Consider McKinsey, which holds itself out as one of the world’s leading repositories of knowledge on how to manage a business. They say they’ll never grow their company by more than 25 percent per year, because otherwise it’s just too hard to transmit the corporate culture. So if you’re growing faster than 25 percent a year, you have to ask yourself, “What do I know about management that McKinsey doesn’t know?”

I still think it’s more efficient—this is just an old Lisp programmer’s stan- dard way of thinking—if you have two really good people and a very powerful tool. That’s better than having 20 mediocre people and inefficient tools. ArsDigita demonstrated that pretty well. We were able to get projects done in about 1/5th the time and probably at about 1/10th or 1/20th the cost of people using other tools.

So you’re doing well, have great people, and are profitable, and then you decide to take VC money? Here was the problem: hiring businesspeople was almost impos- sible. That was one of the things that drove us into the arms of the VCs.

You want somebody who’s a really good manager. Managing your company might be harder than managing Microsoft because Microsoft has $40 billion in cash, so they can recover from mistakes that you won’t be able to recover from. So you need a guy like that.

Why would they want to come work at my company where everything is con- strained?” So it’s not as simple as hanging out a shingle and saying, “Here’s our small company; we have $15 million a year in revenue and we’re profitable; now we need a manager.” The people you are likely to attract, by definition, are people who couldn’t get a job at General Electric.

We were having trouble because the handful of good people who wanted to work at startups were all dazzled by the names of the venture capitalists. They’d say, “If you don’t have backing from Kleiner Perkins, we don’t want to work for you.”

We talked to a headhunting firm, and the guy was candid with me and said, “Look, we can’t recruit a COO for you because anybody who is capable of doing that job for a company at your level would demand to be the CEO.” And I thought, “That’s kind of crazy. How could they be the CEO? They don’t know the business or the customers. How could we just plunk them down?” In retro- spect, that was pretty good thinking; look at Microsoft: it took them 20 years to hand off from Bill Gates to Steve Ballmer. He needed 20 years of training to take that job. Jack Welch was at GE for 20 years before he became CEO.

There was no way we could have hired first-rank businesspeople in that environment. There were too many companies that were low-risk and had more assets that were hiring the best people. All we were going to get were the second-raters. We’d get first-rate programmers because we had a company where programmers were the stars and we already had great colleagues for them, so we were going to attract great programmers, just not great business- people. Because we were not GE or Microsoft, we were not a place where a great businessman rationally would have wanted to work.

We did get one good guy, Cesar Brea, who had done a lot of software con- sulting at Bain. He came by the house to check us out because he had heard about us from a friend of a friend and was looking to work at a company instead of being a consultant. What sold him on us was that, when he came to talk, there was a check for $500,000 from HP on the coffee table that we hadn’t bothered to deposit yet. He knew that if we could leave a check lying around for a few days, then we must have been doing OK.

The other thing was that the original sales pitch that I made to employees was, “Come work here. You’ll make $150,000, maybe $200,000 a year if you do a great job and you make your customer really happy. We can just do that for- ever, making the customers happy, not spending too much. We’ll pocket the profits, we’ll have fun offices, a beach and ski house that everyone can go enjoy and go there for a week and do some writing. We’ll collaboratively have this great lifestyle.”

But they felt like they were dumb because every day they were reading the newspaper about people who had worked for 6 months at some company and now they were worth $20 million because of an IPO. They’d ask me, “Why aren’t we doing an IPO?” And I’d say, “Because we have profits.”

But due to a couple forces—customers and recruiting—we began to think, “Well, maybe we should hand out stock options and tell people this is going to be part of their compensation and try to go public.” We did have more revenue and profits ($20 million and $3–$4 million, respectively) than almost any tech- nology company that was then going public. Despite all of our growth, we were cash-flow positive, and we had all this profit that we had to pay taxes on. I think once we prepaid a year of rent just so we wouldn’t have to pay tax. The company was growing 500 percent a year and generating so much cash that we had to find ways to spend it before the IRS got it.

So we talked to some underwriters—we were big enough that we were actually able to get meetings. They were very candid with us and said, “Look, we’re not going to take you public.” They said, “We get paid a percentage of the deal. The more deals we do, the more money we get paid. If we want to take you public, we’d have to waste a lot of time doing due diligence. We would have to look at your accounting and talk to your customers. We would have to convince ourselves that you were a good company.”

“No, with all the other companies, we just look at the names of the venture capitalists who’ve backed them, and if it’s a big name like Kleiner Perkins, we just take the company public without doing any research. We have no idea what these companies do, we have no idea who their customers are or if they’re sat- isfied. We don’t do any research. We just take them public and take our fee. So in the same time it would take to take you public, we could do five or six of these VC-backed companies. Sorry, we’re not interested.”

That was a wake-up call, and I think in retrospect it shows why so many of these companies that were taken public couldn’t survive. They had no profit and no possibility of making it, but the underwriters never looked at them carefully.

I had brought in Cesar and another business guy who was a Harvard MBA, and we had all these VC firms knocking on our door. I was an engineer. The MIT way of doing things is that you delegate to the experts. If you are riding in a car with five guys and it breaks down and you are a math major, you don’t get out and start poking around with the engine if there’s a mechanical engineering major on board. So I felt like, “OK, these VC firms are all claiming they are going to provide added value and that their money is different, but it’s hard for me to evaluate these things, so I’ll just delegate it to these two guys who are MBAs. That’s what they’re supposed to know about.”

There were these two VC firms—Greylock and General Atlantic Partners— that were among the group, and they would send their senior partners by to schmooze us and talk about their successful track records–building companies and management teams. I thought to myself, “I don’t want to be CEO of this company where I have to repeat myself and tell people what to do and travel everywhere. It would be so nice to just be the CTO and have a brilliant man- agement team installed in my place.” So it was very attractive to me, and our MBAs said, “Yeah, these Greylock and General Atlantic guys, it’s a bigger name, and it will really help us.” Slightly worse terms than Summit—actually, with the deal Summit was offering, I could have sold some of my shares to them, taken some cash out, and had some money, and in retrospect that would have been a very smart idea. Especially if you are going to get into conflict with a venture capitalist later, you don’t want to be a salary man with $130,000 a year while they have billions of dollars in assets.

So I let them decide, and they chose Greylock and General Atlantic. Which might have been OK, except that the senior partners in those firms were so rich that they didn’t want to spend time sitting on the boards of companies they were investing in. Why should they? They had six houses each and Gulfstream jets to get among all their houses. They were going to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Why would they want to sit at my board meeting? I used to sit at my board meetings, and I would think to myself, “This is my own company and I’m bored out of my skull.”

The VCs delegated very junior people to sit on our board. One guy had been a management consultant at Bain. He had never run a company; he never had profit-and-loss responsibility, which is the key. And he never started a com- pany, and that was true with the General Atlantic board guy as well. He had been a middle manager at a big company before he went to General Atlantic. We got these guys on our board who just don’t know anything about running a business.

The guys on my Board had been employees all of their lives. You can’t turn an employee into a businessman. The employee only cares about making his boss happy. The customer might be unhappy and the shareholders are taking a beating, but if the boss is happy, the employee gets a raise. By contrast, the businessman cares about getting a customer, taking his money, not spending too much serving that customer, and then selling something more to the same cus- tomer. These are totally different psychologies.

The VCs found a CEO for the company, and I was like, “OK, great! Finally, I can relax.” This guy was a very smooth talker. He had been the COO-type at a software consulting firm, Cambridge Technology Partners, which is a pretty bad company, actually. They never had a really good product, and I don’t think their customers were very well served. If you are going to get a manager, it’s probably better to get somebody from GE Jet Engines because, at the end of the day, the customer who buys a GE jet engine gets value. It’s a high-quality product. They at least have that kind of culture of building something reason- able for the customer.

Did you like and approve the hire of this new CEO? I liked this guy reasonably well, but a lot of it was desperation. Our customers weren’t hiring us to be management experts; they wanted a really good programming team to build something of high-quality and deliver it quickly. They didn’t need anyone to talk smooth to them. A lot of the traditional skills of a manager were kind of irrelevant when you only have two or three- person teams building something. So it was almost more like you were better off hiring a process control person or factory quality expert instead of a big executive type.

They brought in a new executive team very quickly, and I acceded to this because I knew that my skills weren’t in management and, in theory, somebody else could have done just as good a job as CEO. But apparently nobody could do quite as good a job at making the engineering decisions on the toolkit. Jin and I and a few other experienced engineers—we knew what worked, we knew what didn’t work—we should be concentrating on the product.

The CEO was a guy who had never been a CEO of any organization before, and he brought in his friend to be CFO. His buddy didn’t have an accounting degree and he was really bad with numbers. He couldn’t think with numbers, he couldn’t do a spreadsheet model accurately. That generated a lot of acri- mony at the board meetings. I would say, “Things are going badly.” And he’d say, “Look at this beautiful spreadsheet. Look at these numbers; it’s going great.” In 5 minutes I had found ten fundamental errors in the assumptions of this spreadsheet, so I didn’t think it would be wise to use it to make business decisions. But they couldn’t see it. None of the other people on the board were engineers, so they thought, “Well, he’s the CFO, so let’s rely on his numbers.”

They just thought I was a nasty and unpleasant person, criticizing this guy’s numbers, because they couldn’t see the errors. From an MIT School of Engineering standpoint, they were all innumerate.

Basically, with their CEO that they brought in, they had a three-to-two board majority no matter what. And they said, “We’re going to run this com- pany. We’re going to make all the decisions, and you’re just going to be a figurehead.”

Remember, I’d financed the company and I owned most of it, so it was a big asset for me. It was my only asset, basically. It was just too personal. So after about 6 months, because they had no management experience, no P&L experi- ence, no engineering experience, and no numbers experience, they couldn’t see that what I was telling them was right and that they were headed for some serious financial and customer losses. They just thought I was injuring their self-esteem—that’s what they said.

They basically fired me and all but one of my cofounders. They pushed them out of the company within a month or two. I’d been fired 2 months after they came in; I just didn’t know that I’d been fired. I was still getting a pay- check, but nobody was listening to me. They were telling people, “Don’t listen to him; he doesn’t have any power.”

I was chairman of the board. I’d been fired probably within a month and half, but it took me 6 months to realize it. They finally said, “OK, you’re fired now, but you can still be on the board.” I initially thought, “Maybe this is good.” I was sitting in my bathtub reading the New Yorker magazine, and I realized that I’d been psychotic. That I’d thought, “If I don’t write software, people won’t have any software. If I don’t write books on how to do things, nobody will learn how to do things. If I don’t teach at MIT, these students will never learn anything.” It hit me: I could sit here in this bathtub for the rest of my life read- ing the New Yorker magazine, and Microsoft will eventually write all the soft- ware that people need, and maybe it will be clunky and expensive, but so what? It’s not my problem. They’ll get the software they need, eventually. If I don’t teach at MIT, they have $5 billion in assets, and they’ll be able to hire somebody much better than I am to teach these kids.

That was an epiphany; I didn’t have to work 7 days a week anymore, doing stuff that was repetitive in a lot of cases. I’d been building multiuser Internet applications for 20 years, with a lot of excursions into the CAD computer and engineering world as well, but basically 10 years exclusively in Internet apps. So I thought, “I can be doing something else. I’m an investor in this company. Let them build this company. Let them deal with all these issues. I’ll just collect my dividends.” I thought maybe this was a good thing, that I could do new stuff— new research projects that were interesting to me.

Meanwhile, because these people didn’t know anything about the business, they were continuing to lose a lot of money. They hired a vice president of mar- keting who would come in at 10 a.m., leave at 3 p.m. to play basketball, and had no ideas. He wanted to change the company’s name. This was a product that was in use in 10,000 sites worldwide—so at least 10,000 programmers knew it as the ArsDigita Community System. There were thousands and thousands of people who had come to our face-to-face seminars. There were probably 100,000 people worldwide who knew of us, because it was all free. And he said, “We should change the company name because, when we hire these sales- people and they’re cold-calling customers, it will be hard for the customer to write down the name; they’ll have to spell it out.” And they did hire these pro- fessional salespeople to go around and harass potential customers, but they never really sold anything.

Because I wasn’t a great manager—and I knew I wasn’t—I said, “I’m organ- izing this company like McDonald’s. Each restaurant is going to be managed by a few people, and they’re going to have profit-and-loss responsibility. If they make a profit, they get to pocket half of it. If they make a loss, we’re going to know who’s responsible, and we’re going to go there and fix it, and there are going to be consequences for those people.” That’s a very easy way to run a business. It’s naturally profitable. People have all the right incentives to make their customer happy, to do the thing on time, to take the customer’s money, deposit it in the bank, and then move on to the next one and get their bonus at the end of the year.

Without even realizing what a risk they were taking, the new management said, “Programmers are only good at programming. They shouldn’t do anything but program. So we’ll hire salespeople to sell, and not have programmers try to sit with the customer.”

At the time, Anderson Consulting (now Accenture) didn’t have any sales- people. They always had the people who were executing the project sell it. “You eat what you kill” was the phrase at Accenture. You don’t have a salesperson go out and tell the customer, “We can do this,” making promises and then handing it off to a programmer.

So they ignored the wisdom of Accenture and the history that we had of profitability, and they said, “We’ll hire professional salespeople to sell. The pro- grammers will program; they will not be responsible for anything other than coding and listening to their boss back in the head office in Cambridge. The salespeople won’t have any responsibilities having to do with the project, they will only have to listen to their boss. For keeping to deadlines, the programmers won’t have to do that; we’ll hire project managers to keep the deadlines.” And then they hired these people who, still to this day, I have never figured out what they were supposed to do. They were called “client services.” They weren’t the project managers. I think they were supposed to keep the customer happy.

The new management hired all these people but, if you asked, “Who’s responsible for making sure that this project, overall, makes money for the company and who has an incentive to ensure that it’s done on time and the cus- tomer pays?” the answer was essentially, “Nobody.” You had to go way up the management chain to find somebody who had P&L responsibility. So I told them that they were taking an enormous risk, that they had no idea what the consequences were going to be.

They tried to make everything as much like IBM as possible. They were very conventionally minded. The problem with doing that is that those niches are occupied. If you have bland, boring marketing materials just like IBM and you have very high prices and slow delivery, there is a niche for that product and it’s occupied. IBM is there. The customer doesn’t need you. They just go to IBM Global Services, if that’s what they want, or their own IT department, for God’s sake.

In the case of open source software, it can fall apart quickly. If you become slower and more expensive and more mired in bureaucracy than the customer’s own IT department, then they’ll just say, “We have lazy, ineffective, slow- moving programmers right here in our back office. We don’t need you.”

Basically, whenever VCs do an investment, they make the startup company pay their legal expenses. Remember, the investments come from the limited partners, the pension funds, etc. So they get their 2 percent annual manage- ment fee, but a lot of their costs, like their legal expenses, are also actually being paid by the limited partners. For example, a company is supposed to get a $700,000 investment, but right away they return $50,000 to pay the legal fees of the venture capitalists, so the limited partners actually only get $650,000 of their capital working in that business. If they can’t come up with a scheme like that, they aren’t going to sue you because they are not going to want to spend their own money that they could be spending on business jets and vacations and other things that are delightful to VCs.

So I said, “Great.” My cofounders and I, who were shareholders, had a meeting and said, “Who wants to vote for Philip Greenspun to be CEO and on the board?” We had to change the corporate bylaws also because the default corporate bylaws in Massachusetts are that the shareholders elect officers like the CEO. The bylaws of the company, for whatever reason, said that the board elected the CEO, so we said, “Well, let’s just change it back. We’re the share- holders, so we’ll change this bylaw so now it’s back to the Massachusetts default.” It was a perfectly legitimate bylaw that the shareholders in a small cor- poration would elect the CEO. So we changed the bylaws and elected me as CEO, which, under some other bylaws, gave me an automatic board seat, and then we elected a couple of our founders to the board. So now we had a three- to-two board majority.Q

I knew that they wouldn’t like this, and I wanted to keep things as orderly as possible, so I called up the old CEO—whom I think we had elected COO, so we had demoted him to chief operating officer and kicked him of the board— and I said, “Let’s face it; you’re just not qualified to run this company. You’re losing money. But we don’t want to have any disruption, and you are a good manager and maybe someday you can learn enough to be CEO, but that’s not today.” We tried to make it conciliatory—“We’re not going to change anything, we’re not going to go on a mass firing spree, but we have to get this company back into being cash-flow positive because, whether you know it or not, you’ve lost a lot of money.”

When we got back to Boston, we discovered that we’d been sued. Me, Eve, and Tracy got sued in Delaware Chancery Court. I thought, “God damn that lawyer, Sam, he lied to me; he told me we wouldn’t get sued!” And I later realized that Sam had been right and wrong. They still had control of the company checkbook. Even after he’d been voted out as CEO and the new board had been voted in, the VCs had gotten their pet CEO to write a $1 million check from the company checking account to their lawyers so that they could have this shareholder lawsuit without paying for it. This was an unauthorized looting of the company on behalf of one set of share- holders. It was probably illegal, but in Massachusetts it could take years to recover that kind of money. And they figured it’s not going to be a big deal because we’ll still have control of the company; we’ll impoverish this guy with an onerous lawsuit. He’ll never have enough money or staying power to come after us in Massachusetts for looting, and maybe he’ll never find out.

So now I had to defend this lawsuit. I had to hire Delaware counsel, which was very expensive. It basically consumed all my assets over 2 1/2 months. But they had a case that really couldn’t be won, since they were minority share- holders. Let’s say you have one share of IBM and you go to the Delaware court and you say, “I want to control IBM; I feel like I’m entitled.” There’s really nothing holy left in America: religion’s not holy, the family isn’t holy, marriage isn’t holy, but the only thing that’s really left that is holy to Americans is owner- ship. And that’s what the courts are there for. They are there to preserve the rights of owners of things. So when you go to court and say, “I don’t own this thing, but I want to control it,” you are almost guaranteed to have a poor reception.

Eventually, the VCs simply bought my shares, partly so that they wouldn’t be prosecuted for the next 5 years in Massachusetts court for the looting, partly because they wanted control of the company, who knows. It was stupid. If they wanted to buy the company from me and run it however they wanted when I was sitting in my bathtub reading the New Yorker magazine 6 months earlier, they could have done it at a lower cost without all this Sturm und Drang, and everyone would have lived happily ever after. But it never occurred to them that I would want to do something else with my life. They were very worried about me competing with them and starting a new company. I had been pro- gramming sitting at a desk for 23 years, working on Internet apps for 10 years— did they really think that I would take all my newfound money and freedom and program some more? In fact, I went traveling for a while, and then I went to flight school and got my private pilot’s license and bought an airplane and went to Alaska, and all through this time, they were busy losing money.

What happened to ArsDigita? They finally got a call from the bank saying that they were running out of money in their checking account, I think. That’s when they woke up to the fact that the CEO and CFO hadn’t been doing a very good job. Partly because they had burned through about $40 million in cash (I had left them with about $40 million in cash when I turned over the reins), and they didn’t understand why. The VCs came in and fired the CEO.

There was a period where I wasn’t supposed to talk about them or the com- pany, but that’s over. But I think they don’t like me talking about the lawsuit, because being incompetent and running a company is embarrassing enough, but being totally incompetent in litigation also looks bad.

I had fostered an atmosphere of caring about end-user experience and education and “we’re going to have fun, we’re going to have the beach house and a Ferrari.” We did lots of things for free—we had a foundation, we did pro- grams for high school kids, and we did a one-year intensive computer science program for people who wanted to transition from being a poet or whatever into being a programmer. So people thought of me as a hippie. In reality, ArsDigita was my sixth company, and I knew how to make money, and I was the investor.

So while I publicly had a persona of doing all this fun stuff and money takes care of itself, I was watching the bottom line very carefully. I had set things up so that the company could not lose money while I was CEO, and if there was a problem, it would be identified very quickly and we would fix it.

If you are a for-profit corporation, your job is to make money, and if you’re not making money, you’re not doing a good job. End of story. It’s important to have fun, but once you incorporate for profit, my attitude is that you better make a profit. When I was trying to retake control of the company, most of the programmers at ArsDigita were so relieved to be rid of me. They thought, “Now we don’t have to listen to this guy, we don’t have to have our code reviewed, and we can all be happy and go home at 5 p.m. and never write any- thing. Let the salespeople sell—we don’t have to talk to customers anymore.”

It doesn’t look extravagant to hire a bunch of salespeople and client service people and a vice president of marketing. However, if you hire all these people in suits that don’t do anything productive, that is extravagant. They went through $40 million in cash. But it doesn’t appear extravagant. Nobody will fault you as a businessperson for hiring a salesperson and paying him $100,000 a year even if he is not selling. They won’t fault you for hiring a $200,000-a-year VP of marketing who used to work at Oracle even if he’s useless, because the guy wears a suit and shows up to work every day for 5 hours.

The Ferrari, which costs less than any of these things and sits in the parking lot, looks extravagant. But it inspired the programmers; it got us all this press; it made customers think that we were a profitable, successful business. It had all these benefits. At the end of the day, the Ferrari was the only thing that the VCs made a profit on. When they sold the Ferrari, they sold it for more than I paid for it.

Partly they killed themselves through replacing profit-and-loss responsibil- ity pushed down to the lowest levels with a functional management structure, where you only had to report to your boss. There was a programming depart- ment, the sales department, the client services department (whatever it was), and there’s the project management department, and the only person responsi- ble for overall profit and loss is the CEO. That was really a bad problem for them.

The second thing that killed them was a common phenomenon in program- ming called “second-system syndrome.” We had the first system that was running photo.net, ArsDigita.com, and all of our clients. It was a set of data models in SQL and page scripts that talked to those data models to provide an online community and e-commerce site. Anyway, it was the first web server to have database connection pooling. We’d become a little bit iden- tified with it, and the VCs and their pet managers were convinced that, if we just became the Java company, we’d have an increase in sales. Customers didn’t seem to care.

So what was the problem? We were making money, customers were happy, people were using this. Well, with any big system, people write down a list of things that they don’t like, that they could do better. It gets to be a long list. The biggest problem with our system was the same problem with SAP: you have data models, some customizations, and some scripts to talk to the data models. When you upgrade from one version to the next, you have all this SQL stuff that has to be done in Oracle to migrate the old data model to the new one—if you add columns to the tables, for example. If you are setting up a brand new system, it’s easy. You just create tables. But in an existing running system, you have to alter the tables. That’s kind of a pain.

If there have been customizations done to it that haven’t been rolled back into the toolkit, you may have to recustomize a bit. This is a problem for SAP, and it was a problem for us. My attitude as an engineer was that SAP is a com- pany with billions of dollars in assets and lots of smart people. They had never solved this problem, so we’re not going to attack it either. Not until we have infinite money. We’ll just leave it, and, if customers have to spend 2 weeks of hard programming upgrading the server, then that’s the cost. So that was one of the biggest things.

Fred Brooks said that the second system is always late; sometimes years later than you expect. And in fact, because of the ambition, usually it won’t solve any of the problems. They’ve got a long list of things, and it will solve almost none of them in the end. So that’s exactly what happened with these guys. They told customers, “Don’t use the old system, because we have a new one that should be shipping in 3 months and it will be better.” It actually took them more than a year and a half.

So they suffered all these sales losses because the thing was late. They killed demand for the old product by telling them the new product was “just around the corner.” Then, when the new product finally came out, some critical pages were literally a thousand times slower than the old system. So where you have had a 1-processor pizza box server, you would now need a 64-processor, $2 mil- lion server to serve the same user community. It had never been tested; it had never been released on a running system like photo.net. It was just a bunch of programmers—sitting in a vacuum and never dealing with a publisher or a user—programming whatever they thought. They were all young because they had gotten rid of some of the senior people.

The question-and-answer forum, which was one of the most heavily used parts of the site, was literally a thousand times slower than on the old system.

It wasn’t true J2EE, either. They said it was going to be J2EE, but they didn’t like some of the commercial tools or the open source tools that were available, so they built their own magic persistence layer. They built all their own stuff, so customers who looked at it said, “This isn’t actually J2EE. It’s a pile of Java crap, yes. It’s very complicated, yes. But it is not J2EE.” (To be J2EE, it has to use these other components that are standard and distributed by Sun or WebLogic.) So they failed to achieve any of their goals. The old system took the average programmer about a week to install and figure out and cus- tomize a bit. The new system was taking an experienced programmer 2 full months to understand.

They ended up with a product that nobody wanted. At the end of the day, the programmers killed the company—the junior programmers who were put in charge. The VCs and the management team basically selected programmers according to who had an agreeable personality. They picked people who were pretty junior, who didn’t have much experience with real-world customer projects, and they basically killed the company. Once you have a product that nobody wants, it doesn’t matter how good your management team is.

So 4 or 5 months after our shareholder meeting, they came in and fired the CEO—demoted him to COO or something. They put in one of their own part- ners as the CEO. He hung out there for a while. They put in more money, I think another $10 million, and he gradually figured out that the numbers that the CFO was giving him were bogus. He began to run his own numbers, and he realized that they were losing money on every project and that, if they got one more project from a customer, because the software was so bad, it would cost them more to serve that customer than the revenue. At that point he said, “Forget this, I’m shutting it down.”

If there was one thing you could have done differently, what would it have been? The one thing would probably have been slightly slower growth, I guess. Not to worry so much about the competition, concentrate on getting really good people who shared the company’s vision, who could be mentored to the point where they could then recruit somebody else. Basically, just limiting growth.

Managing programmers is tough. That’s one reason I don’t miss IT, because programmers are very unlikable people. They’re not pleasant to manage. In aviation, by the time someone might be your employee, probably their perceived skill and their actual skill are reasonably in line. In IT, you have people who think, “I’m a really great driver, I’m a great lover, I’m a great pro- grammer.” But where are the metrics that are going to prove them wrong?

If a software company dies, you can blame the marketing people. Programmers almost all walk around with a huge overestimate of their capabil- ities and their value in an organization. That’s why a lot of them are very bitter. They sit stewing at their desks because the management isn’t doing things their way. They don’t understand why they get paid so little. It is tough to manage these folks. But on the other hand, there are better and worse ways to do it. If you want to ensure that the customer gets high-quality code and that the prod- uct is high-quality, you have to step on these younger folks’ egos and say, “No, that’s not the way to do it.” The question is, how harsh can you be? I could have been kinder and gentler for sure.

I think I was good with the customers. That’s one thing: I realized that busi- nesspeople didn’t have any ethics in a fundamental way. Forget how they dealt with me and other stuff, but here’s one example where I realized that having basic ethics was an operational advantage.

What value are you delivering to the customer? Are you delivering what you said and what they paid for? I didn’t think of myself as a pious, ethical expert, but at least I had that much: if you take money from a customer, you should deliver some value to them. After the meeting, I called up American Airlines and got on a plane. It was a Friday and I had some social commitments for the weekend, but I cancelled them. I flew out to LA and told the programmers that I wanted to see them on Saturday and talk about the customer.

The programmers were all pretty junior and said, “It’s the customer’s fault because they keep asking for these features and saying the site can’t launch unless we have all these complicated features. They keep coming up with new ones because they see other people’s sites.”

I replied, “You guys are engineers, and you have to explain to the customer that there’s a lot of learning that happens only once the site is launched. And you have to get them to accept some kind of minimum launchable feature set. You don’t need 100 user question-and-answer forums on sites that are brand new. There are only 15 users. How would they find each other if they’re frag- mented into 15 forums?”

I said, “You can’t blame the customer. You have to work with them to come up with the minimum launchable feature set, and get the site launched. You guys need it for your résumés; you want to be able to say that you worked on a project that succeeded and here’s the site and anybody can look at it, not that you got a paycheck and accomplished nothing and that you worked for a stupid customer and it’s all their fault.”

I brought the customer in on the same day, and we talked to them and found out that, well, they didn’t need the last features if it meant that their site wasn’t going to launch. They hadn’t understood the tradeoffs. A couple weeks later they launched.

Was there anything that you think people misunderstood about the demise of ArsDigita? It really upsets me that people think of ArsDigita as a venture capital–backed company. It wasn’t. It was a company that I started and backed financially, basically by myself, but within a year or two brought in some other smart, good people. It upsets me that they think of ArsDigita as a company that the VCs somehow played a big role in starting; that I sued them and somehow got money trickily. That bothers me. I financed the thing. I put in money and years of labor, and right at the tail end—they were only in there for about 18 months from the time they invested to the time it went bust, and at that time the company was more than 5 years old. So it was not a VC-backed company; it was a company that took VC money just in an attempt to shortcut the under- writing process in going public.

I did not make money through litigation. I bought some shares, took a risk, sold them in the end at a much lower return than I would have if I’d never taken the VC money in the first place. I could have just taken profits out of the company on a year-to-year basis. Just take dividends, instead of giving such large bonuses to the employees—some combination of slightly lower bonuses and slightly less retained earnings in the company. So it was a simple story of investing and then selling shares. The litigation was a sideshow. In the end, they bought me out the same as if they hadn’t sued. They just thought, “Well, maybe we can steal control of the company instead of having to buy it,” and, when that didn’t work, they bought it just like any reasonable person would have expected to.

## Joel Spolsky Cofounder, Fog Creek Software

_Joel Spolsky founded Fog Creek Software with his friend Michael Pryor in 2000. They didn’t have a specific product in mind, but were motivated to start the kind of software company where they would want to work—one where programmers were the stars.

With its popular software, including FogBugz and Fog Creek Copilot, Fog Creek Software has doubled its sales every year, even during the post-Bubble meltdown. The company never took any outside investment, and continues to
operate as a profitable, privately held company._

There was no idea, in the sense that the only thing I thought was, “There’s a bunch of people out there doing certain types of things and they seem to be pretty incompetent, but they’re getting huge valuations. Surely if I did those same things, knowing that I am less incompetent—merely semi- incompetent as opposed to extremely incompetent—I should be able to achieve at least their level of success.”

Probably the key inspiration—what actually made me take the leap into starting Fog Creek—was Philip Greenspun of ArsDigita, who had a particular business plan that seemed to be working at the time. In the long run, it didn’t work, because they took venture capital for a consulting business and the con- sulting market disappeared. But we looked at ArsDigita and said, “Wow! They’re doing all this great stuff. But there are a couple of things that I would do differently.”

A larger thing was that they were developing this product. They had this idea; they got the consulting and they got the product—which was the ArsDigita Community System that they were developing alongside it. The theory was that the product they created would support the consulting, and the consulting would support the product.

But they thought the product needed to be open source, and we thought, “That’s nice, but consulting is a business where your revenue is just a multiple of the number of people you can hire. Software is a business where your rev- enue can grow much faster than the people you hire.” If you can make licensing fees by selling software using the same model as ArsDigita in every way, but just charging for the ACS, we thought that you would have a steady growth of the consulting side of the business.

Michael Pryor and I (we were friends from Juno Online Services) cofounded it in 2000, which was a good move. Probably starting it by myself, I never would have really had people to bounce ideas off of. I don’t know if it would have gotten off the ground, really.

We had, for all intents and purposes, three consulting clients when we started in September 2000. By February or March, we had none. Other firms that were building web stuff lost something like 90 percent of their business in the course of 1 or 2 months. There was a huge dropoff; the consulting market completely disappeared.

The consulting market is the derivative of every other market. When a com- pany is growing, they will hire a few consultants to help them grow a little bit more rapidly. When they’re shrinking, they’ll instantly fire all consultants. If the market is even going down by 0.002 percent instead of growing—which it did, because there was a sort of dot-com nuclear winter—then the first people to go will be the consultants. So the consulting business completely collapsed, and every company in that space more or less collapsed. The ones that remained— Razorfish, Scient, Viant, whatever—all sort of conglomerated into one company with about 120 people, and that was it.

We didn’t have enough consultants at that time. We hired a couple. But since we always knew that we wanted to be a software company on the side, around October or November we wrapped up FogBugz, which was an internal bug-tracking application we had lying around, and started selling it. And lo and behold, people started buying it.

Yeah. Basically that’s where all bug-tracking applications come from.
Every bug-tracking application in the world is some internal developer’s idea.

e actually had three product ideas in mind, and FogBugz was one of them. That was the easiest one and the one closest to being able to be sold. The other two product ideas—one of them was CityDesk, which was kind of a market failure, and the third one was something called Tintin, that we never even wrote, let alone shipped.

We had this idea of a family of three applications that would work together in various ways. FogBugz would provide workflow, Tintin was going to provide a content management server, and CityDesk was going to be this content man- agement client. That was the long-term vision, and we started launching FogBugz because we had it. I think we started making $5,000 to $10,000 a month selling that. It was enough to pay our expenses and live off of once we laid off the two consultants we had hired.

We never took any investments. I put in probably $50,000 of my own money—mainly to cover people’s salaries, when we didn’t have clients. There was a fairly long period of time where I went without salary because I had my own savings. (Michael had less savings, and he took out a little bit of salary.) And we had some expenses, because during this entire period we had an office.

So we increased the price a couple of times, and both times it increased the number of units we sold. We launched new versions, kept adding more and more features. It’s become this gigantic monster. It’s also a whole customer email management system. Your customers email bugs, it spam filters it auto- matically, it sorts them into areas, it assigns them to people, you can keep track of them, you can set due dates, you can automatically reply to a customer with a nice little message that gives them a link that they can click on to see the status of their message. We use it for handling all our incoming company email and make sure that it gets handled by the appropriate person.

At the time, we thought, “Hey, we have this product. We don’t know what else to do. Let’s just ship it and see what happens.” We had no idea. At the time, you could have told me that this thing was going to sell zero copies, and I would have believed you. You could have also told me it was going to sell $50,000 a month’s worth of copies—an equally unrealistic number—and I would have believed that too.

We never thought we would close, because we had this theory that Fog Creek would continue as long as Michael and I could eat and pay whatever external obligations we had. There was no reason to completely and thoroughly give up. And that’s pretty much what it got to. In the first year, I’d say revenues off of FogBugz averaged like $10,000 or $15,000, and that was enough to live on. It was growing at a reasonable rate—I remember literally every month it would grow—at least 100 percent a year. And that gave us the confidence that we could wait this out.

There was money coming in, and the amount of money coming in was going up every month. So there was no reason to give up and go home. The theory was that we would only give up when there wasn’t enough income even to pay the minimum bills we had to pay. I think our monthly overhead was $5,000— mostly rent, but also office supplies and T1 and that kind of stuff.

The basic economic model for us and ArsDigita and those kinds of compa- nies was that you could get a bright MIT grad or whatever and give them a salary of $75,000 to $125,000 a year, depending on experience. That comes out to, at most, $60 an hour, and the billing rate was $200 to 250 an hour for build- ing database-backed websites.

The question is, how do you get the bright MIT grad to work for you and not somebody else? What was astonishing at the time was that none of these companies were making any effort whatsoever to make the work environment pleasant and to treat the people that they were hiring with enough respect that they would be able to attract people. 

Things that to us are basic: Aeron chairs; private offices with doors that close for every programmer; letting programmers report to other programmers, so that your boss will understand you. We had 4 weeks of vacation and another week of holidays, which you can move I think. For the consulting business, we had a rule that you fly first class and that you never be away from home on a weekend.

We actually figured out the entire business model, and we figured that, if we spent 4 percent more or 8 percent more giving people a better work envi- ronment in these particular ways, everybody would want to come work for us and not go to the Scients and the Razorfishes of the world. And that was going to be our business model. Everybody is charging $250 an hour for these con- sultants and paying them $60 an hour. We would pay them the equivalent fully burdened of $64 an hour. That was our clever trick that we came up with, and that’s what we thought our innovation was. It turned out not to have been what we did.

We started a consulting business and we hired a couple really smart people. We had a few clients. We did the whole $60/$250 thing, which was great, and that business then disappeared very rapidly out from under us. So we became just a real software company.

Why do big companies get it wrong? And if you need to make some interactive websites or MTV needs a web server or whatever the thing is, then you don’t even hire programmers; you hire some people who know some people who might know something about the technology. Eventually, you get somebody who thinks, “Let’s get some pro- grammers in here,” and they actually hire a programmer. And if they are lucky, they get a good programmer, but they will torture that programmer until that programmer wants to cry and leave.

A company that is not designed to create high-tech products is very unlikely to have the culture or the DNA that it takes to create high-tech products. So if you are a high-tech person in that company, then you’re basically a glorified typist in some sense. It’s very unlikely that the kind of people who would be suc- cessful in an entertainment company would even understand what program- mers do that makes them more than typists.

The biggest mistake that we consistently made is that we kept getting all kinds of interesting marketing ideas. Well, the first problem we had is that we thought we didn’t understand sales and marketing because, indeed, I am a programmer and Michael is a programmer. We thought that the whole business of sales and marketing, which we recognized as being utterly crucial to the suc- cess of a high-tech company, was completely mysterious to us.

So we were just afraid of the so-called “go-to-market” strategy. I see a lot of startups in their first couple of years kind of flail around— exactly the same way we did—trying to figure out, “Oh shit, how are we going to get people to buy our stuff?”

So the next thing we looked at was selling Fog Creek to some other com- pany that we thought could take us to market. We went through the whole song and dance and negotiations with the company that we thought would acquire us and had the cash to take us to market. It didn’t work because we were prima donnas with inflated opinions of our own worth. In other words, they made an offer for about $4 million, and we thought we were worth about $12 million.

In the early years, we thought, “Let’s get people to link to us on their web- sites, and we’ll pay them a little bit of money if they sell our software.” When we had a consulting business; there was this little thing up on our web page saying, “Help us find some consulting clients and we’ll give you $5,000”—which I thought would get people’s attention. Everybody that had any kind of business experience said, “No. This looks like you’re desperate and it’s a bribe. Take it down from here.”

So it was just a completely goofy thing that we did. But then we took it fur- ther. We said, “Make hyperlinks to Fog Creek properties (or whatever) and if people follow the hyperlinks and buy our software, we’ll give you a percentage— 15 to 25 percent.” It was an affiliate program, just like Amazon affiliates. That actually did get us some sales, but we put a lot of work into developing that, and the amount of sales it got us was negligible.

The one thing we learned over 5 years is that nothing works better than just improving your product. Every minute, every developer hour we spent on any one of these crazy things—although they had some mar- ginal return on the work that we put into them—was nothing compared to just making a better version of the product and releasing it. If we had taken all the effort we put into these crazy schemes and put it into moving our software development schedule ahead by the equivalent amount, it would have paid off much more.

Talk to your customers. Find out what they need. Don’t pay any attention to the competition. They’re not relevant to you. Only talk to your customers and your potential customers and see what it is that caused them not to buy your product or would cause them to buy more copies of it. And do that, and then ship it. That was something we really, really should have focused on, but, you know, we didn’t know any better.

We took no investments because there were so many horror stories about what VCs would do to you. ArsDigita was the most public one, obviously, of kicking out the founders and then mismanaging the company and bringing in the so-called professional management.

So we didn’t want that to happen; we didn’t want to be forced to do anything we didn’t want to do. I find new reasons every day why I’m thankful that we never took any kind of outside investment. Let me give you a small example. The board of directors consists of (because we’re private and we can do what- ever we want) me, Michael, and my boyfriend, Jared.

And you’d keep getting distracted to do their pet projects that they dreamed up in the shower one night and they think might be a good idea, and you just don’t think it’s a good idea.” You don’t really have the ability to say no when you take those outside investments. It’s hard to tell your investors, “Let me just go in my own direction.”

There are things that we do, boy, that I’m so thankful that I don’t have to answer to anybody. I don’t think it’s possible to have private offices for develop- ers when you’re VC-funded, because it looks extravagant. I think that it’s worth paying for in terms of the productivity you get. We spend an outrageous amount of money on quality office space that other people don’t. That makes it easier to recruit and makes us more productive, I believe. But I’ve heard from people that it would be considered completely unacceptable by the average VC to have private office space—because it’s considered an extravagance of a suc- cessful company or something like that. And, you know, “Why aren’t you all in the same room talking?”

I’ve had that argument whether it’s better to have private offices for devel- opers. I don’t want to have that argument anymore. I don’t want to have to try to convince people anymore. Certain features—flying first class, Aeron chairs, double monitors, the best computers that money can buy—these are things which might be considered extravagant, but it’s nice just to be able to do things the way that we believe they should be done, without having to have a big argu- ment educating other people as to why we know how to develop software and they don’t.

Is there any advice you would give a programmer who wanted to start a startup who wants to avoid having to take any outside investment?

It’s totally possible. I would recommend that you create a weblog and have millions of readers every month from around the world that read it. That’s not really necessarily followable. Step two is a little bit hard. I think it’s Larry Wall who used to have this saying about Perl that, “Well, if you don’t like it, just make your own language and then make it popular.” That was his way of refut- ing any and all complaints about the Perl syntax or whatever.

So the reason I’m saying this, even though it’s tongue-in-cheek, is that we definitely got a lot of publicity—what a traditional company would call PR— through Joel on Software. And that caused us to get an enormous number of initial customers. After that, our products spread by word of mouth. Existing companies buy more, and people leave those companies and go to other com- panies and buy it. They’ve never heard of Joel on Software, but they’re still buy- ing our stuff. We’ve actually seen that in the curve. Whereas, in the early days, we would ask people on our website, “How’d you hear about Fog Creek?” when they purchased things, and 100 percent of the people that filled out that field would write, “Joel on Software.”

In our case, our software didn’t really have a strong viral nature to it, and so using Joel on Software got the word out there that we make software products. It worked very well for us, but it’s not necessarily a model that anyone else could be successful following.

Did you have any competitors that you worried about? It’s sort of funny, but, because Joel on Software has such a wide readership, a lot of people say, “Hey, if Joel can do this, I can do this too.” And they’ll copy the model all the way down to the actual product. 

The interesting thing is what they copied. They didn’t really copy the code; they copied the implementation of how FogBugz works. But they missed what made us successful. They didn’t really copy Joel on Software. And I think what’s happening to those seven people right now is they are getting an object lesson that merely copying the product that another company makes does not make you successful. We’re not afraid of those people by any stretch of the imagina- tion. Sometimes they can be aggravating, but we don’t really care.

I remember thinking that, no matter what we knew that the competitors were doing, the information was completely useless to us. It never really changed what we were doing. If it’s like, “The competitors are going to do feature x,” well, if that’s such a good feature to do, why aren’t we hearing about it from our customers?

In other words, why listen to our customers indirectly through what our competitors do when we can just talk to our customers? So my mantra has always been, “Listen to your customers, not your competitors.” I don’t know who our competitors are. Sometimes I’m asked to list other bug-tracking prod- ucts, and by now I know about Bugzilla. I think there’s something called BUGtrack. I don’t know what they have, what their products are, what their price point is. I could research all that, but I can’t think of a single thing I would do with that information.

Looking back on the earlier years, what was most surprising to you? One thing that surprised me was that, when we released a new version of our software (we’re on 5.0 with FogBugz already), there would be a big jump in the number of sales. We would say, “OK, all the upgraders are upgrading right now, so that’s what accounts for the boost.” And the surprise is that after that initial boost, the number never went down. We expected there would be a hump after a new version was released and that would make us want to keep releasing new versions.

Now I understand why that is. You made a better product. When you have a better product, you will win more of the evaluations. More people who evalu- ate your product will decide to purchase it. So you are now on a new perma- nently high plateau in sales caused by the fact that you have a better product. It overcomes more of the hurdles that your software is put through when users evaluate it to see if it meets their needs.

Who did you learn things from? But my first job at Microsoft is really where I learned the software industry. I got there in 1991. At the time, there were almost—I hesitate to say this, but— no software companies that really knew the basics of how to develop software in the way that Microsoft did. They accomplished what they did because they fig- ured out a ton of things about how to make software, repeatedly and reliably, that people want to buy, that nobody else had figured out. And they were doing things like bug tracking—like having a bug-tracking database—that seem com- pletely obvious, and, when you looked around, 80 percent of commercial software companies did not do bug tracking. Or 80 percent of commercial soft- ware companies did not write specifications. Or 99 percent of commercial software companies did not do usability testing.

Microsoft knew that loading a segment register on the 386 was a very time- consuming operation, and therefore on the 386 architecture you can’t use far pointers unless you absolutely have to because it’s extremely slow. Borland did not know that. Result: Microsoft Access loaded in 2 or 3 seconds; Borland Paradox for Windows took 90 seconds to get running. Because of something that Microsoft knew that Borland did not know. And that’s one of a million examples. 

What do you think makes a good hacker? I think what makes a good hack is the observation that you can do without something that everybody else thinks you need. To me, the most ele- gant hack is when somebody says, “These 2,000 lines of code end up doing the same thing as those 2 lines of code would do. I know it seems complicated, but arithmetically it’s really the same.”

For example, Ruby on Rails is a framework that you can use with the Ruby programming language to access databases. It is the first framework that you can use from any programming language for accessing databases to realize that it’s OK to require that the names of the columns in the database have a specific format. Everybody else thought, “You need to be allowed to use whatever name you want in the database and whatever name you want in the application.” Therefore you have to create all this code to map between the name in the database and the name in the application. Ruby on Rails finally said, “It’s no big deal if you’re just forced to use the same name in both places. You know, it doesn’t really matter.” And suddenly it becomes much simpler and much cleaner. To me, that is an elegant hack—saying, “This particular distinction that we used to fret over, just throw it away.”

But it’s also a programmer who gets into flow—sort of what Paul Graham describes as an animal. I see it specifically as a programmer who sits down to do something and they get into a mental state where they’re just cramming away. They’re just generating stuff and the time is passing and they’re not aware of it. They’re just typing, typing, typing, typing, and great things are happening because they’re in that particular mental state.

To me, building a software company—and this is kind of hand-wavy— is creating the factory that was going to be equipped for, when I have an idea or when somebody has an idea, we can throw it into the factory and get the work- ing code at the back.

What advice would you give to a programmer who’s thinking about starting a company? Don’t start a company unless you can convince one other person to go along with you. If you don’t have two people (or I would even say three) that you’ve convinced to devote their lives to doing this, it’s just going to be a different thing. There are a lot of programmers that are very ten- tative about starting their own companies. There are a lot of working program- mers doing something they hate, with some company that they hate, but they need money to pay the mortgage. So they figure, “I’ll develop something in my spare time. I’ll put in 1 hour every night and 2 hours on the weekends and I’ll start selling it by downloads.” And you say to them, “Who’s your cofounder?” And they say, “My significant other—husband or wife. My cat.”

But because they never really take the leap and quit their job, they can give up their dream at any time. And 99.9 percent of them will actually give up their dream. If they take the leap, quit their job, go do it full-time—no matter how much it sucks—and convince one other person to do the same thing with them, they’re going to have a much, much higher chance of actually getting some- where.

## Stephen Kaufer Cofounder, TripAdvisor

_Steve Kaufer, Langley Steinert, Nick Shanny, and Thomas Palka started TripAdvisor, an online travel site, in 2000. Frustrated by the lack of unbiased, use- ful information for travelers, they created a site that, in addition to searching relevant content already on the Web, let users contribute personal reviews of des- tinations, hotels, and attractions. The online travel forum was a pioneer in the now common practice of having users pick the winners, instead of leaving the choices up to human editors. 

ripAdvisor became the largest online travel com- munity in the world, and was acquired in 2004 by Barry Diller’s InterActiveCorp (IAC). As of July 2006, TripAdvisor had amassed more than five million user
reviews and opinions, covering 220,000-plus hotels and attractions._

This was ’98 or ’99, and I thought I’d use the Internet to find out more. I found a whole lot of websites that would help me book a reser- vation at this hotel, but nothing that would tell me whether the hotel was any good or not for what I was looking for.

By that point, I had spent a couple of days in sort of mindless searches, try- ing to find the real scoop on the hotel, not the official blurb. My wife suggested, “You know something about technology. You could build a better search engine to find what you’re looking for in travel—not the published opinion, but the unpublished, unbiased opinion about a place, a location, something to do.”

I was introduced by a friend to another cofounder, Langley Steinert, on the business, marketing, business development, financing side of things. So the two of us kind of took up the project as, “Hey, this is something the world clearly needs.” I felt I could build it with the team of folks I had in mind from past lives. Langley had the business development experience and connections to sell and market it. Because I had started a few companies before, I knew it was important to have the right combination of skills and interests amongst the founders. We assembled four initial founders of the company and got our first round of funding in February of 2000.

We were going to focus on destinations, hotels, and attractions. We’ve always pretty much stayed away from collecting opinions on air, for instance. But we were going to search the Web, just like Google—or AltaVista, which was king of the hill in those days—but with a focus on travel. We’d be able to come up with better results, where better was, again, not just all the booking sites that would help you book a room in a hotel, but really opinionated information.

We tried different approaches. We tried to randomly crawl the Web and we thought, “How are we going to randomly select out of the billions of pages?” So we tried crawling from known travel hubs. We’d start from the Yahoo Travel directory and see where those sites led us. We tried to pick out good, interesting information and automatically categorize it. That didn’t work so well. What we call the signal-to-noise ratio wasn’t good enough—meaning that, when they got our results back, people wouldn’t say, “Oh yeah, that’s what I was looking for.”

We ended up looking at all of the published sources of information—news- papers, magazines—and manually went through all the websites from all these places to find the ones that had free access to the back issues of their travel arti- cles. Then we hired people to read every single travel article we could find on the Net, and classify that article into our database, and write a one-line sum- mary. It’s a fairly significant effort, and people that we talked to said, “You’re nuts. You’ll never finish.” But if you actually do the math, you realize that you can work through the backlog (it took us a couple of years, but it was only a couple of years) and then can stay current with what’s being published without too much of an effort.

Because we would have the richest database of travel information, our hope was that it would become a requirement that, if you were in the travel industry or offering a travel section of your site, you have access to our content. And we would license it out and/or get a share of the revenue generated on the page views from that. Lycos Travel, Yahoo Travel, AOL Travel, Expedia, Travelocity— all the players would have to have it. No one would try to build it themselves, because we’d always be able to stay ahead, since we were entirely focused on it.

After a year and a half, we had closed one licensing deal, with Lycos, where they were featuring our content on their travel portal, and we were getting a revenue share on what they made selling advertising on the pages that we pro- duced for them. Everyone else basically wanted to be paid to feature our con- tent, and we wanted to get paid to have our content featured. It was a typical dot-com business problem: built the product, people liked it, and the feedback was universally positive, and we got the expansion questions that we were happy to get, like “When are you going to cover Paris?”—but we just were not making a dime.

We were also trying to raise a third round of funding, and we were basically looking at going out of business in 6 to 9 months. It was a little hard to go back to the existing investors and say, “Hey, pony up more money. We’ve got a great product. We have no revenue, and we’ve been trying to sell the stuff for a while. We have no takers. The one company that did license it is generating a couple hundred dollars a quarter for us. But really, toss in a couple more million, because it’s a great idea.” It was a tough pitch to make. We made it, and we actually did raise a small third round—more, I think, from the perspective of “Look, this is a good product. We’ll figure this out.”

We were 11 people before September 11, and we slimmed down to 8, so our burn rate was really pretty small. Everyone took salary cuts; we were paying $18 a square foot for office space; we had really no expenses to speak of. We were stretching the dollars, and even though it was Internet dot-com days, we had never done anything remotely lavish.

We tried running a banner ad. We didn’t try to sell it; we just copied Expedia’s banner ad and put it up on our site. We wanted to see how many people would click on it. We might have had 3,000 visitors that day and we might have generated 100 clicks, so maybe it would have been a couple of dollars to us. So that was just clearly not going to work. But one of our prospects a couple of months earlier had asked us whether or not we could run ads based upon the search query. If someone was searching on “Boston,” could we run an ad for Boston? We explained, “We don’t run ads. That’s not our model. We’re trying to license you the content.” But it struck us months later that we do have people that are qualifying themselves to be interested in Boston. In fact, we have people qualifying themselves to be interested in the Eliot Hotel in Boston, because they’re reading a review about it. What if we created a link from TripAdvisor deep to an online travel site like Expedia and had teaser text that said, “Book a room at the Eliot Hotel in Boston,” and, if the user clicked on that link, we took them all the way down to the booking page on Expedia? Our crawler technology knew how to do that, so it was leveraging something we were pretty good at.

We approached Expedia and said, “Hey, we’d like to advertise your 50,000 hotels on our comprehensive travel site, and we want to charge you only for the leads that we’ll send you.” I explained how our leads were highly qualified. “These are wonderful travelers, they’re reading reviews, and we’re going to do lots of bookings for you, so we’d like you to advertise with us.” He said, “I’ve never heard of you guys. Prove it.”

I can certainly understand why he’d never heard of us, because no one had. And he didn’t really care much whether I was sending him qualified leads or not. He only cared about whether the leads I sent were going to make reserva- tions. The way it works is, they give you a tracking code to put on the link. We said, “It’s no work for you. Give me the tracking code; I’ll start to advertise 50,000 properties for you.” Which I did, and we ran it for a month for free for them. Then, before the month was out, I gave them a call and said, “How’s it going?” And he said, “Well, I just looked at the stats the other day. You guys are doing pretty well. Can I pay you $10,000 for December to buy 20,000 (or what- ever the exact numbers were) leads?” Here was a client who was on the second or third call offering to pay me money to keep the links up.

This worked. We actually got a lot of people clicking. Probably 10 percent of the time that people saw that page, they were clicking on one of those links. Click-through rates at the time were a quarter of a percent or half a percent. Here we were sitting at 10 percent because the links were so relevant to the topic at hand. Our first client was thrilled with it.

“If they stop actually doing bookings and they just click over, then I’m not renewing the order. So it’s up to you guys to keep your traffic qualified.” This wasn’t really an issue for us, but it just drove home the point: if he got bookings, he would happily pay us for advertising.

Once other companies saw Expedia advertising, they sometimes didn’t need a free test, but we might say, “Look, our leads are normally a dollar a click, because they convert so well. But we’ll let you get started at a quarter. And we’ll send you 5,000 leads, and you can test with no risk. But you know, we’re looking for an insertion order to show that you’re committed to the test.”

We went from no revenue to break-even in the course of about 4 months. That part was a testament to finding a model that worked. To break even, I had to do $75,000 in revenue for the month, something like that. We had never let our burn rate grow. We didn’t do any advertising at that time. But even since, we’re rarely going to do promotions that we can’t tie back to actual revenue-generating activities on the site.

There wasn’t anything obvious that we should spend money on, other than hiring a lot of people, and I’m just a fundamental believer in small teams do better than big teams. We were building a product, and if there were 5 people and they were all within shouting distance of each other, they were going to build a better product than if we had had 15 people.

Building the product actually went along reasonably well. The sales and marketing and business development was the biggest challenge, because we just didn’t have any takers. We finally had a major company come forward who wanted to license our database, and they were offering to pay us, I think, $50,000 a month. Maybe it was $30,000. The deal on the table would have covered half of our burn rate, right there, all at once. At the time, we looked at that deal and said, “You know, it may be this or nothing”—as in, if we don’t take this, we might just go out of business. When you look at a deal in that light, a very unattractive deal, maybe that’s what you have to do to survive.

As we proceeded down the negotiation path with this company, though, it became clearer and clearer that they wanted to be able to cut out of the deal after the term (I think it was 2 years) and essentially walk away with all of our intellectual property. Their point was, “Hey, our dollars are funding a lot of the creation of this thing. We’re going to be building a much bigger product around it. If we can’t renegotiate terms, you can’t cut our product off at the knees and walk away with your database. We need to be protected, and we need a copy of your database and the tools to maintain it. You won’t have to maintain it for us anymore, but we’ll be able to keep going.”

The notion that I take all of my time and energy, build up a business, and then hand another company who is going to be a competitor the crown jewels of the business—fundamentally the business, except for the people—after I thought about it, that ended up making it a reasonably easy decision. “No. I’d rather go out of business than take everything I’d worked for, for so long, and hand it essentially for free to somebody else.”

My tip for someone in a similar situation—a company looks like it might be going out of business—this might be the only way to get enough capital to survive, on terms that really aren’t very acceptable: keep pushing at it. Don’t say yes too quickly, don’t say no too quickly, to see whether any other options come along, or to see whether the deal gets so bad that it actually becomes an easier decision to just say no and you can go about your plans. We had a few sleepless nights back then.

Can you think of a moment when you wanted to quit? No, I never wanted to quit. I mean, it wasn’t working, but I was going to find a different way to try—something different, something new. A good chunk of our engineering team was directed to running tests for prospects who might conceivably be clients. We weren’t doing a whole lot of new product innovation, because it wasn’t the product that was stopping us from being successful; it was the sales and marketing strategy. I said, “Look, we will take everyone in the company and turn them into somebody that’s going to help close the sale to keep this company afloat. So you’re doing one of two things: you’re either helping on some prospect we were chasing, or you’re help- ing in the financing prospect we were chasing.”

There weren’t really direct competitors. We were fighting more of a problem of, “No one else is using your stuff. We seem to be doing OK without it. So why is your stuff critical? Why do I have to pay you for it?” The dollars that might have been spent on us were probably going to a Frommer’s or Fodor’s, which were branded content sites.

We look at all the user reviews that come in every day and make sure they meet our posting guidelines: Is it family friendly? Are you using hate speech? Is there racist commentary? We will not edit the reviews at all. We’ll either reject a review or allow it to be posted.

We have a form on the site where the hotel manage- ment can post a response, so that our visitors can see both sides of the story.

But we won’t take down a posting if a hotel owner complains. And we make no attempt to verify the factual accuracy of a review. From our perspective, we have to be a little concerned about libel laws, and we fall under the sort of com- munications act that says we’re a conduit for consumers talking on the Web.

In 5 years, we haven’t been sued by anyone—because, when you actually go look up the law, we’re protected. There may be some hotel owners with a legit- imate beef, but there are some hotel owners that are really just not very bright.

Initially it really didn’t matter. Our traffic is so high now that we know, for better or for worse, we have a significant impact on where visitors are choosing to stay. For every city, we kind of have a satisfaction index; we rate which hotels our travelers like the most. If you’re ranked first or you’re ranked 20th, the number of reservation calls or bookings you’re going to get is going to change. When we changed our algorithm, it dropped some hotels and raised others. Our phones were ringing, because we had had a material effect on their businesses.

When Google changes their algorithm today or when they update things, it has a significant effect on the people who run their business based upon getting traffic from the Google search engine. For us it’s a responsibility, because we want people to trust TripAdvisor. People absolutely post scathing reviews. But we don’t want to be spammed. We don’t want hotel owners to tell all of their employees to go write wonderful reviews of the property. So we have our tech- niques and our human and algorithmic ways to detect that sort of fraud, to keep the accuracy of TripAdvisor as high as we can.

Certainly the most surprising to me was how much people voluntarily share their experiences. I had never written a review before starting TripAdvisor. I had never posted my comments on Amazon or anywhere else. But we’re able to collect millions of opinions each year. It is 2006, and we’re up to over five million now. So you have a lot of people out there that, for absolutely no reward whatsoever—we don’t pay them for opinions, we never have—will take the time to write a review or answer someone else’s question.

Is there any advice that you would give to someone who is thinking about starting a startup? Certainly the founding team makes the biggest difference. Usually founding teams don’t stay together for very long. That happens. If the founding team splits in the first 6 months, that can be pretty devastating to the birth of a company. So getting to know someone before actually joining forces, spending some more time thinking through what the roles and responsibilities will be between the founding team members.

Tip number two: you can’t get too attached to your vision in a startup, because things may change. It’s not a sign of failure to change your vision. I remember in a previous company, we wanted to be this, but we were offered a consulting contract to do this, that, and the other thing, and, yeah, that wasn’t in the plan, but we’ll take that, because that’s going to add $50,000 to our startup capital, and it’ll only take x amount of time. Yeah, be wary of distractions, but if you’re lightning-focused on just one thing and aren’t willing to consider others, you probably don’t have the flexibility to make it when things don’t go accord- ing to plan. That’s the one truism: things won’t go according to plan.

At the earlier stages of the company, when you’re actually out trying to get some customers, do whatever the hell the customer wants. If they’re going to pay you, the customer is right. Because you need that initial money. You need that customer on the list to go get the next one. If you have to give away what- ever you’re doing, give it away. Get the customer. Make them into a reference account. Make that customer into the person that sings your praises the loudest, and really uses your product or service.

Then, as you’re growing, sort of mid-stage, what I tried to foster here is an attitude of risk-taking, where all I want to know really is what’s my downside scenario in terms of time and opportunity cost? If I can try something offbeat, weird-sounding, and it takes a few weeks, and the downside is, in my case, I rip it out of the live website, or, if you’re producing software, I rip it out of the piece of software, or I don’t document the feature if I’m producing a piece of hardware or whatever—if the amount of time spent making a mistake is small, don’t be afraid to make a lot of mistakes without a lot of time analyzing whether you should or shouldn’t do it.

On the Web, it’s particularly easy to try something and get feedback. If it doesn’t work, drop it. I’ve come up with really interesting ideas that were utter and complete failures on the site, and I make fun of myself in company meet- ings when I talk about those. Then I look at each group and say, “Hey, I’m hoping every one of you—in addition to all the successful ideas you’ll come up with—aren’t afraid to come up with some resounding failures.”

Certainly one of the keys to our success was being fanatical on the hiring side of things. I was almost going to answer, “Well, I would have liked to have hired more top-notch folks throughout the company earlier.” Because I’m still in that position now— I’m still struggling to fill positions with the types of people that we want to hire. It’s not something that we do very efficiently here. It takes us a long time to fill a req.

When we do fill a req, we have a fantastic success rate. Many observers and people that have done due diligence on TripAdvisor over the years have com- mented on the caliber of individuals here. But if I ever start another company again, I’d love to have as a founding or very early team member someone who was a trusted recruiter. Because the difference in almost any position between someone who does a good job and someone who does a great job might be 20 percent more in salary, but it’s 100 or 200 percent more in throughput. 

If you can have enough people in the company that work twice as efficiently as the person sitting next to them, because they just know what to do, what not to spend time on . . . I mean everyone, they’re more or less all working the same number of hours. It’s rarely a work ethic issue. It’s just, hey, you give this engi- neer a task, and it’s just done right in half the time as the next person. That it’s done right, that’s the first important part; it’s done quick; and there’s just less communication if the teams are smaller, because everyone’s getting twice as much done. Now how the heck do you fill a company with people like that in every single department? Well, you tap out of your friends pretty quick; but absolutely, go hire your friends.

As I advise other startups from time to time, if you find someone you like, pay what it takes to get them to come to your company in options or in salary, depending on the company’s stage. But getting the right people—especially in that first dozen—is so much more important than getting the req filled. Unfortunately that slows down the hiring process a lot, which slows your growth a lot, which is how I circle back to say, “In the next company, I’d hope to have a recruiter on board within the first half a dozen people to help get the right next 12 people.”

So in turn, it actually makes recruiting a little easier, because you come in, you meet the people, “Man, you’ve got a bunch of sharp people here.” “Yeah, that’s right. And Expedia did a customer survey for us, and it came back that 98 percent of the people said they really enjoyed working with the other people here.”

IAC was a fantastic company to be acquired by, because they told us their history was, “We acquire companies and we let them run stand-alone.” So we came on board. I have to report finances up through IAC instead of my own five to seven person board. Other than that, we were really left on our own.

IAC said, “Hey, you’re running a business. Tell us what you’re going to do, then do that. And let us know when you need help.”

I couldn’t figure out what a receptionist would do. And executive assis- tants, we don’t have those either. So on the subject of hiring, I don’t look at a head count budget when I think of hiring people. I wait until I see the need for someone—when I can carve out a job description that’s 80 percent full on the day someone starts—and that’s when I’ll open up a new req.

For receptionists and executive assistants, it’s something of a running joke because, well, what are they going to do? Make travel plans for us? We already know how to do that. Answer the phones? Well, I can answer my own phone; it’s not too much of a bother. Schedule meetings? Well, we try not to have too many meetings to schedule. So if we were to hire one, I’m sure they would be busy all the time, but perhaps not doing anything that really needed to be done at TripAdvisor. With engineering, there’s usually more development that I want done, but I can look and say, “Am I willing to fund that project?” With market- ing, with customer acquisition, with accounting, I first look and say, “Hey, what’s taking people’s time? What can we automate?” If I can’t automate it, do I really need it to be done? If I do need it to be done, all right, then we’ll open a req.

Chapter one is starting up the company, getting anyone interested in what we do. Chapter two was hitting that profitability mark so we could break even. Chapter three is growing, and if it so happens, as it did with us, a great liq- uidity event. Chapter four is, “OK, are you done with the business? Do you already have a commanding number one market share and no competitors?” “Why wouldn’t everyone want to start on TripAdvisor when planning a trip?” So if I have 20 million uniques a month now, why don’t I have 50 million? My defini- tion of chapter four is being the most popular travel site in the world.

## James Hong Cofounder, HOT or NOT

_While looking for a job in 2000, James Hong launched a website with his friend Jim Young just for fun. HOT or NOT lets users submit photos of themselves and have others vote on their “hotness” on a scale of 1 to 10. A few months after launching, they found the way to generate revenue from the site: they added dating for a monthly fee. Despite many acquisition offers, HOT or NOT continues to thrive as a stand-alone company. As of July 2006, HOT or NOT had counted about 13 billion votes._

My brother and I were working on a website at the time called XMethods, which was the first directory of publicly available web services, so we were talk- ing a lot about what would be a cool consumer web service. In 1999, everyone was talking about web services in the context of B2B, and I remember thinking, “What about consumers? Aren’t consumers going to do this stuff too?”

When Jim said that he thought he found a 10, an idea popped into my head: what if you had a service where people could post their pictures into the sys- tem, and then other people could rate them from 1 to 10? The original vision was that your client would call the web services, get a picture, and have it ran- domly float across your screen or pop up on your screen at random times during the day. The idea was that all our friends that were working in cubicles could have a window: a random girl walking by you that they could rate from 1 to 10 on if you thought she was hot.

Jim was burned out from working on his PhD, and I had just graduated from business school and was unemployed, so I figured what the hell, let’s build it. It wasn’t that hard to build in the beginning—it was hard to build later because we had to scale it—but just putting up something that looked like it worked was easy. It was not something we focused on. We had the idea one Monday, and it was coded by Wednesday or Thursday in spare time, really, and then Jim sent it to me on the weekend. There was no hurry; this was not some- thing we were thinking about.

My dad was the first person that ever saw HOT or NOT besides Jim and me, and he got addicted to it! Here’s my dad, a 60-year- old retired Chinese guy who, as my father, is supposed to be asexual, and he’s saying, “She’s hot. This one’s not hot at all.” We knew then that the idea had some legs, but we didn’t know how much.

I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this, but after I sent out that first email, I went rollerblading around a big office park where Tellme was based. I went up to a random guy and said, “Hey man, have you checked out hotornot.com yet?” He said, “No, what’s that?” I said, “Dude, just go check it out!” Then I went home and watched our logs for Tellme and saw a hit come in 10 minutes later, and then more hits kept coming from different people within Tellme.

Three days later I went back to that parking lot and found someone else and asked, “Have you seen some site where you rate people from 1 to 10?” And he said, “Yeah, dude, HOT or NOT!” So that was cool; it totally spread on its own.

Not at all. The site was on the XMethods server and we really needed to get it off because the traffic was shutting it down. The bandwidth was crazy; we were hosting the pictures at the time. After you voted, it took 30 seconds to get the next page—and at the end of the first day I calculated that this thing was going to cost at least $150,000 in bandwidth per year at the current run rate, and it was growing fast.

We realized quickly that the momentum would make us broke. I was already $60,000 in debt from grad school. I had turned down a consulting job paying around $170,000. I did it to roll the dice, but I was poor. I knew we couldn’t afford this and thought seriously about shutting it down.

There was no plan for a business, it was just, “How the fuck do we keep this thing going?” We weren’t trying to figure out what kind of boat we needed to build, we were trying to keep from drown- ing. But we did know a few things: we had to reduce our costs, we had to make it make money somehow, and we needed more machines. And because the idea could be so easily copied, we had to get as much press as possible to lock out anyone else from getting publicity.

Take me through the turning points of the first 8 days. Basically, the feeling was: do whatever you have to do, just scrape on by. So we first addressed the biggest problem, which was getting rid of the huge bandwidth driven by the pictures. That was why we almost shut down the site. It was 12:30 a.m. after the day we launched, and I was sitting in the drive-thru at In-N-Out when I had an idea.

“We’ll just FTP all the pictures we have now up to a Yahoo GeoCities account, and we’ll change the database records so that it will point to the files on Yahoo, and then from that point on, we’ll just make instructions telling people to go to Yahoo GeoCities and then submit URLs of their pictures.”

We lost some users from submitting it this way, obviously, but it solved the problem. And the way I figured it, I said to Jim, “Dude, how many page views, especially at the speed of the site, will anyone have each day, maybe 25? All we need is 25 new pictures a day and we’re done. We don’t have to have a billion pictures, we just need 25 new pictures a day. So that’s what we did. And this wasn’t planning, it was survival mode. I can’t tell you enough how much it was survival. Desperation is a good word to describe it. So between 12:30 and 3 a.m. on the day we launched, we moved all the pic- tures to Yahoo and solved the image problem.

But the Salon.com article was coming out the next morning. I called the writer and asked her if she could push the story back, but she said it was a slow news day and she couldn’t. So the article came out and the server got slammed. My brother needed the server for XMethods, so we did the quickest thing we could think of, which was that night at 3:00 a.m., we took the site down, grabbed an extra PC—a 400 megahertz Celeron, no-memory-in-it machine that I got for free when I opened an eTrade account—and drove to Berkeley where Jim had a shared office.

I remember taking the top off a case for pushpins and mounting it on top of the power switch of the machine so no one could turn it off. Then we put it in the corner under his desk and surrounded it with books, so it just looked like a bunch of stuff under his desk with a little Ethernet cable coming out.

We now had solved the two most immediate problems to keep the site running, so we were breathing a little easier, but the site was still slow. On day three, I started looking into managed hosts, and Rackspace came up as the clear Linux leader. Though we had no money, we were getting a lot of press, so after a failed attempt to pitch my idea to the Rackspace salesperson, I called the head of business development and said, “I know you guys want to go public and it’s great to get your name out. Your whole value proposition is that you can help companies scale fast by outsourcing. If you can help us, I have all these upcom- ing interviews, and we can be a poster child for you.”

He said, “OK, don’t worry, just tell us what you need right now to scale, and we’ll figure it out later.” So every day that week, I would call them and say that we needed more machines. We owe Rackspace big.

At the same time, a friend suggested that we sign up for an ad network, and we were trying to get into 24/7. But we were having a lot of problems with porn and naked picture submissions to the site. And I knew that no one would adver- tise if this was dirty. So we came up with the motto “Fun, clean, and real” and created a system where people could click a link under an inappropriate picture and, based on an algorithm, we would kill any picture that got clicked on too much. So it was community-regulated and that worked pretty well.

I sent an email to the founder of DoubleClick telling him about us and requesting his help getting into 24/7. He responded saying that unfortunately the first picture he got when he went to our site was a naked woman. He said that right now we were innocent until proven guilty, but we needed to move to a guilty until proven innocent model in order to get advertising.

So we decided to build a moderation system. I originally had my parents moderating since they were retired, and after a few days I asked my dad how it was going. He said, “Oh, it’s really interesting. Mom saw a picture of a guy and a girl and another girl and they were doing . . .” So I told Jim, “Dude, my par- ents can’t do this any more. They’re looking at porn all day.” We decided to open up the community of moderators to the public. You had to apply and write an essay to get in. It was basically built on the BBSs of the old days that had dif- ferent levels with different skills.

We told the moderators to reject any pictures that were inappropriate, looked like an ad, or had contact info. (Pornographers were including fake email addresses to get people to email them so they would spam them later.) And then we got a bunch of emails from people saying, “Hey, I was meeting people.”

We quickly realized that we needed to make something to allow people to meet each other without letting all these porn people in. So we came up with the “Meet” system, which required a little more work than most dating sites, because it requires both people to be active. You can’t just post an ad and wait for emails to come in, so it’s harder for porn people to come in and take advan- tage of it. We started charging $6 per month to belong to the Meet Me sys- tem. We chose the pricing based on what we thought would be an impulse buy.

n retrospect, it’s easy to see that we had this dating system that was slap- ping us in the face, but it took us a while to think that we could charge for it, because the Meet Me system was never built to make money. It was only built in response to the porn issue. It’s ironic that I have an MBA and also started a company before that had raised venture capital, but the one idea that worked was all an accident.

Another thread of what happened was that I was trying to reduce our costs. Though we weren’t being charged yet by Rackspace, I now knew how much we needed to cover those hosting costs, plus enough to hire someone to manage the site. After running into a guy who worked at Ofoto at an office-warming party, I talked to Ofoto about how we were sending people to GeoCities, and since many of our users have digital cameras, maybe I should send them to Ofoto instead of Yahoo to host them, and now Ofoto would have a lead. So I did an affiliate deal with Ofoto.

On top of all this, we were constantly fixing the site to scale. We were work- ing like madmen, only getting 3 to 4 hours of sleep a night for a long time. It became a race between Jim and me; could I bring in people faster than he could keep up with? It was a good challenge for both of us. My job was to make a bottleneck and his job was to clear the bottleneck, technically. So we didn’t really get to breathe until we had the Meet Me system and it was making money. I think it made about half a million a year when we started, and we now had a scalable business model.

By the way, this was in December, in the first 4 months. We also had talked briefly to Lycos about selling. They were offering something like $3 to $5 million—this was after 2 months of work—but we didn’t want to sell because we thought they would destroy it. We thought they’d stick pop-up ads every- where and make it corporate and lame, and then it would die. Our reputation was worth more to us. I thought the company was worth more, too.

The scaling issues were pretty bad. It seemed like Jim and I were non- stop everyday, trying to figure out how we could make the site better or faster. That first half-year seemed like a day. There was a lot of manic behavior going on. I was on an adrenaline rush, which felt good, but it was exhausting and sometimes I felt like I was going crazy. So much, so fast, all at once. It was fun, too, though. We got in People magazine, Time, and Newsweek. By the end of the year, we got on Entertainment Weekly’s It List.

Why was HOT or NOT instantly so popular? Looking at hot chicks is fun. It’s voyeurism. The concept at the time was so new and edgy. No one had ever seen it before or thought about it. It was just so funny—and painful too. Like voting for people who were so ugly that you wondered why they were voluntarily doing it. People in Silicon Valley are entrepreneurs, they’re not the risk-averse types that would think I was wasting my education. I was the first among my MBA classmates that made it into the Wall Street Journal.

I’d say do it. There’s kind of a backwards logic that says: when you are young, you should learn from people who are experienced, so later on, if you want to do a startup, you can take the risk. And that’s a myth that was created from school. You need to learn to get to the next level. 

The biggest roadblock to the entrepreneur are liabilities in your life. It’s not whether or not you can be a good entrepreneur, it’s whether you have to make a mortgage payment or support other people. Experience will come when you face certain problems and live through them. And the best way to do that is to put yourself squarely in the path of those problems.

I think entrepreneurs want to make money. It’s not that they do it for the money, but they want to make money. Because money is the measuring stick; it’s how they know if they’ve won or not. And I think a lot of what drives entre- preneurs is the kind of legacy they are going to leave. They want to make a mark in the world and feel like their life mattered. Entrepreneurs are the kind of people who love ideas and want to build things, and add value to the world.

Part of that is to quench their ego’s thirst and say, “I matter.” That’s why people like Bill Gates and Vinod Khosla spend a lot of time doing nonprofit things. It was never about the money. Carnegie dedicated the latter part of his life to giving all his money away. He was trying to convince people to give your money away once you make it. Because that’s when it can start doing real good, too.

The hardest decision you make as an entrepreneur is not one that you make while you’re building the company. For me, the hardest decision was not about solving the hosting issues and all that. It’s like Hewlett-Packard. Do you know what their first product was? A bowling foul line indicator. The point is, they decided that they were going to be entrepreneurs before they knew exactly what they were going to do, and that’s very common.

All these things come out of new ideas. If you’re not in school and you’re not an entrepreneur, you’re not working on new ideas. You are just a cog in someone else’s wheel, and you’ll never make anything new. So the hardest thing is to say, “I’m going to put myself in the position of being an entrepreneur by having ideas and trying things, and not giving up when I fail.”

What other advice would you give to someone starting a startup? You need the early team to be savvy in everything. And you have to have people who understand the users and the product. If you do, then you’ll have users. And nothing ever goes according to plan. You can’t dwell on the fact that your plan didn’t work. In our case, we didn’t even have a plan, but it would have been worthless to have one anyway, since we just kept moving as fast as we could. You have to hustle; you can’t just have a plan and cakewalk it. You just have to know what direction you’re going in and run around like a rat in a maze trying to get out.

The ironic thing is that from running HOT or NOT, I care less about looks now. When I was a dork, I never really dated anyone who was hot. The models— they weren’t going to date me. So you always aspire to it, they’re like the untouchables. All of a sudden, HOT or NOT happened, and I was starting to date all these attractive women. I got a taste of it and I realized that looks don’t make up for a good personality. Many of these girls were annoying. They were fun to hang out with, but I couldn’t have a conversation with them. I’m sure there are smart and hot girls, but if you look at the hot ones first, it’s harder to figure out if they are smart too.

Any other advice about startups? One, do it while you’re young. Two, there’s no right path. There is no one plan that fits every business; you
have to figure it out yourself. There is no magic formula. hree, even if you raise money, spend it as if it’s your own and you have
none. Your organization has got to remain smart and lean. Be cheap. There’s no shame in being cheap. I still fly coach. Four, there’s no such thing as easy entrepreneurship. It’s going to be painful, it’s going to be emotionally unstable, you’re going to feel insecure. If you’re not already bipolar, you will feel like you are.

I don’t spend that much money because once you get used to spending money, it’s very hard to get unused to. Happiness is reality compared to expec- tations. If I have low expectations for material things in my life, then I’ll be happy. If I get used to fancy meals all the time, not only will it ruin McDonald’s for me, but even the fancy food would become normal, and then it’s not mean- ingful. So I’ve been careful not to change my lifestyle too much.

I’m not in debt anymore, and I have financial freedom, but the first what- ever million is all you really need to get that. If you had the opportunity to cash something out for x million, but you thought with some hard work you might be able to make it worth more, for some people that’s the right decision to go for it; but for other people, take that money, put it in the bank, and now you can do whatever you want for the rest of your life. It depends how tied you are to that one concept as being your legacy for your entire life.

## James Currier Founder, Tickle

_James Currier came up with the idea for Tickle (founded in 1999 and originally called Emode) after taking a personality test in one of his Harvard Business School classes. 

A former venture capitalist with a passion for dig- ital media and social sciences, Currier believed that the Internet could be used to help people learn more about themselves. People could visit www.tickle.com to take several different kinds of personality and self- assessment tests, most backed by scientific research, to understand areas of human behavior (and also to
find out what breed of dog they most closely resembled).

Tickle was acquired by Monster in 2004 for about $100 million. Shortly
after this interview, Currier founded Ooga Labs, a digital media studio that develops consumer Internet applications._

When I was at business school, I would think about the media companies that were popular at the time—like Broadcast.com, Women.com, and iVillage— and they didn’t make any sense to me. They were basically trying to put old media experiences online. For example, Spinner.com was putting radio online, and they got sold for $340 million. I thought that was crazy.

I knew the Internet was going to bubble up its own unique media form. It was probably going to be user-generated, and it wasn’t going to be like anything that we see on the other mediums. So I was looking and looking for what that was going to be at the same time I was getting my degree at business school.

Eleven days later, we got our results in manila envelopes—all in black-and-white text with a little graph—and soon we exploded into conversation. People in that commu- nity talked about the test for about 2 weeks—at dinner conversations, on the basketball court. I watched this and thought, “I’ve never seen anyone talk about a movie for this long. That’s powerful media. Why?” 

So I discussed this with my family, who were involved in psychology, and asked, “Are we our own favorite subjects?” We’re very concerned about our- selves and the people we know. I realized that no other technology allowed us to get media about ourselves. All the other media technologies allow us to learn only about people we will never know. Tom Cruise, Tom Brokaw—we know a ton about those people and yet we’ll never know them.

I believed that the Internet would allow you to have a media experience about you and the people you know—though it wasn’t going to be the best video, audio, or magazine—and that was going to take a lot of different forms. And I thought this testing could be incredibly powerful because people love talking about themselves, love talking about the people they know, and it could be viral.

At the venture firm, I saw how most online media companies were getting killed by acquisition costs, and I realized that to build a successful company, you had to have very low—if not zero—expenses for acquiring users. So I thought that these tests could be a very promising area to start a digital media company through.

A lot of these tests were trapped in the ivory tower. Why couldn’t we just release them online, make them inexpensive, and just benefit humanity? It could be a good foundation for a media business, and even if it failed it would be doing something good for the world.

How did you get started once you had this idea? I had to come up with what the product would actually do. And then I had to start talking to people about it and getting their ideas. There’s a balance between thinking that you have this fantastic idea that you don’t want anyone else to know about and the need to talk about it and get broad-ranging opinions so that you make as few mistakes as possible. I was really paranoid because I thought this idea was incredibly obvious. It seemed like this was the best thing to do online—it would be incredibly viral and it would be deep because you’d get so much data on people. You could help them find the right job, get a great date, decide whether to get an SUV or a minivan, help facilitate conversations within the family. And people would answer honestly, because the test was about them and they’d want accurate results. It was just obvious to me that you could build a huge media company on the back of this thing. So I was relatively paranoid about that and only talked to people that I trusted.

At the time, everyone was caught up in the success of Broadcast.com, iVillage, and Women.com, so they believed in their value. Instead of saying, “The people who are buying those companies are stupid,” they were saying, “Those guys must know something I don’t know.”

What else was challenging? Where you are is never enough for the people around you. Because starting a company is the act of collecting and organizing the human energy that is in the ether. You are trying to take all this matter that’s around you and shape it into something that fits with what’s in your head. And all these people who are being shaped want to know where you are now and want you to take another step along the path so that they can feel more confident. They are always searching for more confidence points.

They say that: you need a name, a business plan, a longer business plan, employees, money, an office, business cards, a website, users... Everyone is looking for the next step. And so as you go along with each of
these confidence steps, you can pick up more and more people into what’s going on.

So then you go talk to a venture capitalist, and they ask if any other venture capitalist is interested. And then once you get other VCs interested, you say, “Yes, they’re interested and maybe you guys could syndicate them and do the round.” They say, “Well, have you received a term sheet from them?” Then once you’ve received a term sheet, then the VCs get interested, and then acquirers get interested. Women.com offered to buy us out for $32 million once we got our term sheets.

You have to get to these levels to attract more people, and then you hit these spark points, and in my process the spark point was getting the term sheets from the VC. People suddenly want to work with you, loan you money; PR firms want to spend your money, investment bankers want to meet you.

Which spark point would you consider most significant for Tickle? The launching of the dog test. When we started the company, we wanted to change the world, and we had all these tests on the site to help people in their lives. We had the anxiety test; the parenting, relationship, and communication tests. And no one came.

I remembered that advertising agencies say if you want people to remem- ber an ad, include babies and puppies. So I thought, “We should make a fun test. Let’s do a test for what kind of breed of dog are you.” So they came up with a 15-question test that wasn’t scientific at all. We put it online, and 8 days later we had a million people trying to enter our site. Our server was going down every 10 minutes. We had to emergency unplug it from the wall, throw it in the back of the car, and plug it into a T3 at an ISP in Lynn, Mass.

Once we got crazy traffic, we were able to then show the graphs to the ven- ture guys, and we were on our way. They said, “Anyone with traffic can make a lot of money on the Internet, so I’m in.”

My willingness to communicate with people and my understanding of their need to form their brains and their language around their relationships with each other and the product we needed to create. I genuinely cared about my people, and I built a culture where you communicate—you don’t blame— and you learn what the heck the other person’s talking about.

ou, psychologist, you need to learn a little about engineering. You, engineer, you need to learn a little about what the user actually experiences. You have to understand why they like the question this way so that the writers can do their job. So it was really just a matter of empathy that I had for the team, and communication style.

You have to figure out how to hire people who are nice, communicative, smart, and capable. If you’re missing one of those four things, you can’t stay. And so you have to churn people out and be willing to let them go. It was painful, but I knew from the beginning we were going to have to do that.

What would you tell someone who was considering starting a startup? That it is incredibly painful and it will take over your life. If you care about it and if you have any chance of succeeding, you will stop being present for the softer things in life like your family, friends, or dating life. And when you are there with them, you’re not really there with them; you’re thinking about this thing because you’re creating it, and it takes that amount of passion to make it work.

At an HBS reunion, we had a roundtable for all of us who had been entre- preneurs, and one of our professors asked, “What didn’t HBS teach you about this?” And I said, “Pain.”

## Blake Ross Creator, Firefox

_Blake Ross and Dave Hyatt started Firefox as a side project while working at the Mozilla Foundation. They were working to revive the struggling Netscape browser, but became frustrated by the constraints imposed on them. So Ross and Hyatt decided to build a browser that they would actually want to use. 

Like a lot of things described in this book, Firefox was something new. It was an open source project run like a startup, both in the concern for the end user and in the attention paid to marketing. The results were impressive: Firefox has cut into the formerly overwhelming market share of Internet Explorer, and dominates among technical users._

Firefox was more a response to our experience at Netscape than to the dominant browser, Internet Explorer. Explorer had basically been abandoned at that point; in 2001, Microsoft disbanded the IE team. So we started Firefox as a way to work on the browser that we knew we could make if we weren’t being controlled by marketing, sales, and all these other influences inside Netscape. It started off with just three or four of us—the people who had always been fighting these battles within Netscape to make the right decisions for users.

For example, we wanted to include pop-up blocking in Netscape 7. It would have been the first mainstream browser to include pop-up blocking. The Mozilla folks had all the code ready, but Netscape wouldn’t include it because Netscape.com had a pop-up ad. Those kinds of decisions were painful, and it was frustrating to have our names on the product that was getting released. So we started a project called Phoenix, which was supposed to be an allusion to the mythical bird that is reborn from its own ashes. It was like the project was being reborn from the ashes of Netscape.

Firefox was very different from traditional startups. Companies usu- ally worry about competition for financial reasons, but when we did Firefox, money was just always sort of there. There were donations, seed money from AOL; we eventually got this Google deal, but it wasn’t a source of fear for us, because we knew if it didn’t make money . . . It wasn’t even supposed to make money—it was a hobby, right, so we didn’t really care. I was in school. It didn’t have to succeed.

It sounds bad, but the project was kind of just for us at the beginning—to make something that we knew we could make, but not inside Netscape. It was an outlet for those frustrations. We wanted people to use it, but we weren’t going to kill ourselves if it failed. We defined success in terms of users, not competitors.

In any case, the IE team had been disbanded, and Netscape had bowed out, so the market was wide open. We didn’t crunch numbers or conduct market analysis; we relaxed and followed our gut. There’s a lot more pressure now with Parakey. People expect another Firefox or something like that.

The only thing that bothers me is that Microsoft seems com- pletely driven by competition. We tried to be driven entirely by users. There was a need, so we tried to cater to it. We didn’t say, “We’re going to try to crush Microsoft” just to crush Microsoft. That wasn’t the intent, even though that’s kind of the stated goal of some misguided open source projects.

Whereas Microsoft, they win a browser war, so in 2001, they bow out. Which is completely irresponsible, because this is the most used software appli- cation in the world, and they just stopped developing it. Now they are back in the game, because they have competition, so that pulls them back in. I will say that Internet Explorer 7 is shaping up to be a good browser; I just wish it came a few years earlier.

I respect companies like Opera, which also produces a browser. They aren’t doing that well right now, but at least they’re in it for the right reasons. They’ve been around for a decade now, and they are passionate about the Web. Microsoft just kind of comes and goes with the money and the competition, and that doesn’t seem like the right motivation to make a good product.

Do you think Firefox has reached the mainstream because it is better? There are a million different reasons. Many people think it’s easier. Others were just sort of weaned onto it when their children put it on their computers. We don’t have people shaping a message or working the press. It’s all been grassroots, word of mouth, done through Spread Firefox. It’s been inter- esting because we’ve seen about a dozen companies adopt the same model since then. There’s GoTrillian.com, SpreadOpenOffice.org—there are all these different copycat sites.

But I’m making it seem like startups are so stress-free, and of course that’s just not true. It’s just really freeing not to be . . . We weren’t trying to strike it rich with Firefox. It’s open source and it’s free. We weren’t trying to take over the world; we had kind of modest goals, and it was OK if it failed. We were a lot freer to make risky decisions.

If you can afford to do things that way, it’s just so much better. You’re not thinking about venture capitalists or marketing or sales. Just product and users, all day every day.

I thought marketing was something that required a degree and formal experience. It turns out that marketing is just making the product good enough that people spread it on their own, and giving them ways to do that. It’s a lot easier and more natural than I thought it would be. Now I can’t stand meeting with professional marketers who try to “craft” the “message” and all that junk.

People loved the simplicity and went crazy over tabbed browsing. What’s weird is that I didn’t really talk to anyone I knew personally throughout the course of Firefox development. My parents and my friends—most of them didn’t really know I was working on Firefox until it came out and there was the Business 2.0 article. That’s when everyone was like, “Wait, you work on Firefox?” They knew I “did something” with computers, but . . .

I think they knew I worked on Mozilla. They knew I worked at Netscape, so they knew I worked in browsers, but they didn’t really know my involvement in Firefox until they read about it in a magazine. Which is kind of how I prefer it, because it’s much easier to spend a couple months on some- thing, fail silently, and just go back to school, than it is to tell everyone that everyone is going to use our product. It’s easier if people aren’t bugging you until you have something to put in their hands, and then they can tell you if it’s good or not.

Well, I did in a way. I went back to school for 6 months, and I wasn’t working on the project much during that time. It wasn’t that I walked away— we knew there were people working on it—but it was leisurely because we knew that Microsoft wasn’t coming back any time soon.

From our earliest days at Netscape, Joe and I were always shooting the breeze about how terrible software was and what we would change if we could. After some Firefox press hit, we started getting emails from investors saying, “We want to meet.” And we’d think, “Meet about what? It’s an open source hobby project.” Then we realized, “They want to meet about funding us, so we should probably get some kind of company together.” We figured this was the perfect opportunity to act after years of talk.

One is to make sure you are always in communication with the people who are eventually going to use your product. It’s very easy to just lock yourself in a room and code all day, and you forget what the real problems are that people are having. So you have to keep talking to people and keep refining what you are doing.

I also learned how you build up the right kind of buzz about your product in an honest way. With Firefox, we catered to the bloggers first, even though they weren’t our primary target audience. Once you get the prominent bloggers to pick up the scent, you attract the intermediate press, the PC Worlds and the CNETs. You still don’t have any moms or dads yet, you don’t have any non- techies, but once the mainstream press sees PC magazine talking about it, then they start to cover the story, and they actually make it kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. They write that “everyone is talking about Firefox” when, of course, mainstream users haven’t even heard of it yet. But they are going to, now that the New York Times wrote about it.

One is, in general, not knowing what’s “normal.” Investors hand us “normal” term sheets, consultants ask for “normal” fees. I’m 21—I haven’t seen enough of the extremes to know what’s normal. Our approach has been to make decisions slowly and methodically, do our research, and figure out who’s on the level and who’s selling us lines before signing anything.

But we’re also nervous about finding someone else, so it’s hard. Just finding and interviewing candidates is stressful, because it’s not like there’s a team back home coding. If Joe and I are at a meeting, no one is pushing the product forward, and that’s scary. There’s a question of, “Is it better for us to spend all of our time iterating very quickly, or potentially ruin that dynamic by bringing on someone that we don’t know well?”
In short, I’m nervous about everything. If you’re doing a startup and you’re relaxed, you should be very worried.

One thing I didn’t know was how tightly connected everyone is in the Valley. We’ll meet someone, and then we’ll meet someone who I would never expect to even know that person, and they’ll say, “I heard you met Tony last week.” It’s such a small industry, and so much business is done through the net- work circuit, which is kind of upsetting, because I’d rather the good companies get the good deals and the bad ones don’t get deals at all. Instead, it’s more like, “Who do you know?”

## MenaTrott Cofounder, Six Apart

_Husband-and-wife cofounders Mena and Ben Trott started Six Apart (named for the number of days between their birthdays) in their apartment in 2001. Trott’s personal blog, Dollarshort, was growing in popularity, and she was dissatisfied with the blogging software available at the time. So she and Ben decided to develop their own and share it with some friends. Movable Type became popular almost imme- diately on its launch in October 2001.

In April 2003, Six Apart received funding from Joi Ito’s Neoteny. They launched their hosted service, TypePad, later that fall. In January 2005, the company announced the acquisi- tion of Danga Interactive, the makers of LiveJournal. Six Apart launched Vox (formerly known as Comet), a hosted blogging platform with a social network-
ing component, in 2006._

Luckily, it was all kind of accidental. When we released Movable Type, it became popular pretty quickly, and it became a full-time job. I think having customers from day one was the thing that really forced us to be a company. If we had been just talking about a product and we had to build up a customer base and figure out how to market it, that would have been incredibly hard. So what we did was just jump in with no desire to do anything more than create something that we love.

Later on when we were talking to VCs, they would say, “What problem does this solve?” We weren’t giving pitches, it was just conversational, but that’s the thing that never occurred to us. We were never trying to solve anyone’s problem other than mine or a few bloggers’.

One of the reasons that I started my blog was that I felt like I didn’t really
have any friends. When Ben and I were together at college, we never forced ourselves to make friends with other people because we had each other. It was a new thing for us because we had started going out when we were seniors in high school, and then we spent the rest of the time joined at the hip. We always had each other. Plus we got so involved with the Web and doing work that it never occurred to us to make friends.

So I wanted my blog to have a connection with people online, all these people that I wanted to be friends with. My blog helped facilitate that. One of the things that was really painful about those times in the apartment was that Ben and I really didn’t have any friends, and we really didn’t do anything extracurricular. We went to parties occasionally, but it was never fun. So one of the hard things was that we shut ourselves in for so long working on this. It was such a different experience because Ben and I became such a team, everything we did was together. There was probably a 2-year period where we didn’t spend more than 6 hours apart. The first time I went on a business trip for the com- pany was the first overnight trip where we were apart longer than 6 hours.

Even after we became more of a company and we had employees, it wasn’t until about a year ago that we’ve been able to say, “No, I don’t want to talk about work at home.” Having an office made a difference. Working out of the home is the hardest thing to do, because you can never leave work.

Ben and I sort of have this perfectionism about what we do. We can’t do it halfway. So we said that we were going to figure out how to make this some- thing that could sustain itself. But at the same time we knew that we were going to have to get jobs. At least that’s what we thought, because it was free—it was just donations. You can’t make money off of shareware. But luckily people started donating very quickly, and we were at break-even just about after the second month. And it was break-even pretty much until we got funding.

We never actively asked for money because we thought that was obnox- ious. We had one page up that said, “We take donations and this is why you should donate.” There were two factors why people would donate. One was that they liked the product. The other was that we’d give recently updated keys.

When you posted your blog, it would appear on our main site, and if you paid around $20 you’d get a key to do that. So people would say in the email, “Can I have my key? Here’s my money.” Well, you could kind of think that you are paying for the software, but here’s your key. I actually sent those emails out with their keys up until probably January of 2004. It was a really long time. I felt that they were giving money, so I wanted to honor that and thank them.

We never sought out money. Joi Ito contacted us because he was using the product, and he was interested. He was actually probably more inter- ested in just talking to us about what we were doing. And then he said, “If you’re ever interested . . .” We kind of ignored him because we didn’t know what to do. We didn’t have any desire to take money. We had heard all these horror stories about people receiving venture money (this is 2001/2002), and even though we didn’t think we could have the aspirations to be something huge, we certainly didn’t want to crash and burn because we took money when we shouldn’t have.

And we didn’t know anything about it. Are you supposed to pay them back? We didn’t understand that investors put money in and they own a part of your company. All we had heard were bad things that happened, and we didn’t know why.

We met him with Barak [Berkowitz], who is now our CEO, and they talked about what we were inter- ested in doing, and we said, “We’re working on this hosted service”—it didn’t have a name yet—“It’s easy and it’s this thing that we think we can get a lot of people using.” But to us, a lot of people meant that if we had 130 people using it, we’d break even. If we had 3,000 users, we’d be set for life. And we would maintain a service where it was 3,000.

Barak said, “That’s great for a niche or personal lifestyle business, but we’re not interested in investing in that.” At that time we thought, “Who is this ass- hole? Why is he saying that to us?” First, we didn’t care—we didn’t seek him out. And also we didn’t want someone else telling us that our goals weren’t ambitious enough.

After that lunch, they invited us to go to Japan to talk. We were like, “OK, we get a free vacation.” We didn’t think that we would take any money. The fact that Barak was challenging whether we could do it made us want to do it more. We also knew that, if they didn’t invest in us, they’d invest in somebody else. At the time, Blogger hadn’t been bought by Google yet, and we thought, “OK, Blogger will get the money if we don’t.”

We always had an ambitious, “we want to win” attitude, but we never had the stakes so high, because it never occurred to us that we could do it. I think that’s one of the good things, too: since it never occurred to us that we could do it, it didn’t occur to us that we couldn’t do it. We just had to put our minds on it. And that has been really key to what we’ve done. The lack of experience made us think, “Why can’t this just be done?”

We treated the money like it was our own. We were so concerned about it. Suddenly we had this money and we couldn’t spend it all because, if we spent it all, we’d need more, and then we’d need more and then we’d have zero ownership of our company. That terrified us.

As a result, we didn’t hire fast enough and we weren’t in an office. We had closed in April, but we didn’t move into an office until August. We had one employee who was working out of his house in San Jose, one in New York, and our support person was in Minnesota. It was like a remote office and nothing was really changing because we thought, “We can’t spend this money.”

We bought operations stuff for TypePad—servers, etc.—and we had payroll for the first time. Five people on payroll. Five people is a lot more than zero. And Ben and I were never really taking a salary other than what we earned from consulting, which was just kind of recycling itself.

We were the complete opposite of the things that typified the Bubble. We saw the Bubble, and we saw people spending too much money on things that didn’t matter. Then you have us, who didn’t even want to buy a refrigerator for the office because it cost $150. I think that there’s a middle road that’s a lot better.

Why did you set yourself up as an LLC instead of a C corporation? We were looking at the California incorporation book, and we said, “We have to figure out if we’re going to be a partnership, a sole proprietary, a C corp., or an LLC.” And we were looking at the checklist and we saw “can’t take money,” so we said, “Let’s do that one.” It’s amazing. For anyone who is starting a company, it’s so hard. We got the Nolo book on incorporating and we looked online, but it’s so hard. We owe a lot to Barak. He became a board member (for Neoteny) after the investment, and he was the best board member because not only did he help us figure out the business strategy, but he also helped us figure out how to get an office, how to get insurance, how to wire our office and do the business stuff. That’s one of the reasons we made him CEO—because he was so willing to do everything that we needed and he wasn’t an investor who would just give us money and check on us every quarter.

For example, he let us not ramp up as fast as we could because we had to learn for ourselves that that was not the best idea. Another example was when we went to look at offices. Barak went, because Ben was at home working. We’d look at offices that had like 10 or 20 offices, and I said, “If we need an office that big in a year from now, then I don’t know what we’re doing, because we don’t need that many people.” He said, “OK. You can make that decision.” So we got like a 1,500-square-foot office that we outgrew in 8 months. People asked why we got such a small office, and it was because I thought everything else was too big. I realized that on my own. It was really important; he did it in a good way.

We were this incredibly early-stage company that had no structure, no employees, no really good accounting, nothing but the LLC. But we had a huge customer base, which I don’t think most startups have. We had hundreds of thousands of people using our products, and it had been operated with so few resources. So we had to really start from scratch. 

: Ben and I were still trying to do everything ourselves, and that was incredibly stupid because we just wore ourselves to death. Ben and I pretty much were the only people that built the first version of TypePad. We said, “Let’s not hire anybody. We did Movable Type on our own. We can do TypePad on our own.” And it killed us.

The slow pace at which we hired was good for the budget because we were able to operate on that $600,000 for a really long time. But at the same time, it wasn’t good that it was at the expense of our health.

What else went wrong? Skimping on hardware sometimes. I wouldn’t recommend that. We often had to replace the stuff we bought because we had been so worried about costs. With LiveJournal, Brad [Fitzpatrick] wrote everything instead of buying things. That worked for him. He did his thing for 6 years. So I think it works, but we had a different scale than LiveJournal, which took a long time to get a large base.

Why did you build new software for TypePad instead of reusing the code you had for Movable Type? Movable Type is download software that you install on your own server. It was meant for people who knew their way around installing server software. We realized that more and more people were coming to blogging with less and less experience. That’s relative to the people who are coming in now, who prob- ably have only installed one web application. So we wanted to have a service that anybody could use. That’s why we started developing TypePad. It’s a lot more like WYSIWYG, and you can drag and drop items into your templates, and you don’t have to know any coding. It’s a very different product than Movable Type.

Movable Type and TypePad are kind of the same audience, and then there’s LiveJournal. Movable Type and TypePad are both about 50/50 gender split and it skews toward people in their 30s. With LiveJournal, 70 percent are under-21 females.

It’s funny, because Movable Type is a tricky install, but it would be almost impossible for someone to install TypePad because there are so many things that are required with the server setup. It’s kind of trying to decide what the best of all the worlds are. That’s what we’re doing with the Comet stuff that we announced at DEMO. It’s kind of the next-generation platform. It’s all the fea- tures of LiveJournal that are really good—privacy per post, friends aggregation, to be able to read people’s posts—with the publishing options of Movable Type and TypePad. So the reason why TypePad didn’t become Movable Type is because the audience is differentiated and it didn’t make sense to have that on an installable.

That’s some advice for people: don’t apologize for wanting to be a company. You see so many people who say, “Oh, we won’t charge; things should be free.” It’s like you don’t think you’re worth being paid for your time. I feel even more strongly about this when it’s an entire company rather than just me and Ben. We can be kind of the fools that will work for free, but I’m not going to make other people suffer for that.

With Movable Type, we said, “Why should businesses get this for free? Why should we get taken advantage of?” There were so many people that were set- ting up hosted services using Movable Type, and they would charge users money. So we set up these limitations with the licensing saying that you can only have x number of blogs and x number of authors. We just wanted to target the people who were making money off the software that way. But we applied it to personal users too much; we said personal users couldn’t have this and people freaked out. They went crazy. Our biggest mistake was that it shouldn’t have been across the board.

When we changed the licensing, people flipped out. They were like, “These are the people that screwed you. We supported you for all these years.” It was really hard for us because we had always been the darlings in the industry. We never tried to be that, but people just thought we did no wrong. And we didn’t do any wrong. I don’t think we did wrong with that, but, as soon as you charge for something, it changes people’s impression. So we suddenly became evil because we wanted to make some money from our product. It’s unfortu- nate because it’s kind of the mindset that people have on the Internet—that things shouldn’t cost money. But you have to pay people and pay the rent.

It’s really complicated, and I think that most people who aren’t in our situa- tion can’t really pass accurate judgment. I remember when Ev [Williams] sold Blogger to Google, and people were like, “Ev sold out!” We thought, “OK, he started a business and he sold his business.” You shouldn’t be ashamed of want- ing to be a successful business. Of course, you shouldn’t do things that are unethical, and we have never done anything unethical.

What competitors did you worry about most? We never really obsessed about it. We were always worried about Blogger. Other than that, there’s the open source software, the free software that competes with us. What we want to do is get tons of people blogging—hundreds of millions of people blogging—and there’s room to have more than one software doing that. I don’t think people realize that. They see it as an all-or-none game. I think it’s really important to realize that you are building a market, and you have to build for the most number of people and not be so worried about counting. It’s not as much a numbers game as much as innovation.

Was there ever a time when you wanted to quit?  Yeah, it was really the pre-launch of TypePad. That was the hardest time because Ben was doing more of the operations stuff. I remember I was in the shower, and I just lost it. I was crying and I was like, “This is never going to end. I can’t do this anymore.”

I don’t know why I broke down in the shower, but I remember it because we were at our old apartment. I remember looking at the tiles, and I just could not imagine how we could get out of it. It’s really hard to think about it because it was a really hard time. I’ve never blogged about it. Maybe I should, because people don’t understand how hard it was.

It was the pressure. Paying customers. I think it was actually after TypePad had launched because we had paying customers. It just didn’t seem like there was any light at the end of the tunnel.

But it’s like when you look back at your teenage years and you think about how horrible they were, but then you realize that they weren’t that bad. What, you didn’t go to a dance? That’s the worst thing in your life? It’s like, “Well, it wasn’t that bad,” but it always seems worse when you’re in the midst of it.

When we went to Japan for that trip, we said that if nothing ever came out of this company other than this trip to Japan, we’ve accomplished a lot. We never thought we’d go to Japan, let alone on somebody else’s dime. What we have to realize is that we’ve had so many good opportunities and we’ve learned so much that, if everything failed tomorrow, we would still have gotten so much out of it.

I think it’s really important that you have a realization of what’s important. You can’t stress over things that you can’t necessarily control. Even though we can control the success of the company to a certain extent, you have to be grate- ful for what you’ve got. We were able to buy a house. We never thought we’d be able to buy a house. That’s a huge thing.

I think it was even harder because of the marriage. It’s hard to be so stressed out and not have any outlet that’s not work. But at the same time, Ben knew what I was going through more than anybody else could in the world, and so I didn’t have to tell him how I was feeling because he knew what was bothering me.

Whenever we got into really big fights, it was always about something not working right. And it was me. If something breaks, usually it’s going to be engi- neering. It’s not going to be design, because design is something that doesn’t break. It may not work the way people want it to, but it’s not going to be notice- able. So I would freak out and say to Ben, “This is down! Don’t you know it’s down? Don’t you care about the company?” But yelling at Ben isn’t going to fix it. That’s something I realized. But it’s back to that pregnancy thing; I’ve blocked out the really bad fights.

Looking back in your whole experience, what would you say is the most surprising thing? There’s the whole, “I can’t believe we have a company that has 100 people.” The surprising thing is that there’s going to be someone here now that I don’t know personally. It’s not just to a point where I’m not good friends with them, like other employees; it’s like, “I don’t know this person’s name.” I feel badly, and I should know everyone’s name, but it’s hard.

The good part of it is that I don’t have to interview everybody. It’s not like a small company where, if I don’t interview this person, then they can’t get a job. So I’m very happy. We still have our staff meetings every Friday where every- body comes in, and we talk and introduce people. So we’re still a small com- pany in that sense.

It’s surprising that we’re still doing it after 4 years and that I actually like this job. I never liked any of the jobs that I had (even though I only had two). This is something that I enjoy doing. I love work. Last night I thought about it because we just sat around all weekend watching TV, and for a little while I was like, “I don’t want to go to work tomorrow because I want to finish watching Lost” but then I thought, “I like work and I like coming in and talking to people.”

How do you handle people who criticize you? There are a lot of people, especially competition, who really criticize the company for no reason. They personally attack us. They say we’re stupid. It’s really mean. That stuff bothers me. Not as much anymore, because you have to realize that people don’t do this sort of stuff unless they’re really . . . It’s like when your mom tells you that the reason a girl is picking on you in school is probably because she’s depressed. You have to understand they’re coming from a place where they feel like they have to do it.

But we’re successful and that’s one of the reasons why we get picked on. You don’t pick on the underdog. 

## Bob Davis Founder, Lycos

_Lycos was started in 1995 when CMGI’s investment group, @Ventures, bought a search engine developed by Michael Mauldin at Carnegie Mellon University and Bob Davis signed on as CEO. The company grew rapidly over the next several years as Internet usage exploded. By the peak of the Internet Bubble, it was the fourth most popular site on the Web. In 2000, Lycos was acquired for $5.4 billion by Terra Networks, a subsidiary of the Spanish telephone company, Telefonica._

 The technology was invented back in 1994 by a brilliant computer scien- tist at Carnegie Mellon University named Michael Mauldin, whose nickname was Fuzzy. It was a research project, the result of a federal research grant. So it was Fuzzy by himself in a closeted office at the research lab at CMU.

 One day my friend Dan Nova called me just to check in socially. He told me about how he was trying to put a deal together with Carnegie Mellon for a tech- nology and that, if he got it done, he wouldn’t have a CEO. At that point he was in the early stages of thinking about the deal. I said, “What about me?” He laughed. I said, “I’m serious.”

 We had the technology. But Lycos was little about the technology and all
about consumer brand. We were a little late to the game because, by the time we incorporated, other search engines like Infoseek and Yahoo were in the marketplace. So we showed up trying to figure out what we wanted to do. We were somewhat inde- cisive in the sense that I couldn’t make the call between technology and media.

Fuzzy was very committed to being a research scientist and didn’t want to join the company or be involved with the business side of it. But our agree- ment with Carnegie Mellon required us to keep a presence in Pittsburgh. So despite the fact that Lycos was headquartered in Boston, we were obligated to have a meaningful presence in Pittsburgh.

We were fortunate in the sense that Carnegie Mellon gave us a good draw of students, postgraduates, and alumni in the area, since it’s a premier com- puter science institution. We hired our first few technical engineers out of Carnegie Mellon—one that was Fuzzy’s student assistant and another that was working in their data labs.

So what were some of the other big problems that you faced early on? What weren’t they? Hiring people, firing people, understanding our business model, getting customers, servicing the customers, finding office space, scaling the company, staring down competitors, going public, raising money, satisfying shareholders. That’s all in the first 9 months.

Well, startups have been around forever, but working for a startup didn’t have the euphoria that it had a few months later. But there have always been entrepreneurs and people willing to take risks. The Internet wasn’t cool, for sure, and Lycos was unheard of when we started the business.

But bear in mind, at this point in ’95, even computers in the home were somewhat unusual. We had them on our office desktop, not at home with our kids using them. We look back retrospectively at the Internet and say it’s the greatest medium that’s ever existed. But in ’95 email was unheard of other than in the office.

So who were your first customers? We talked all the time at Lycos about the three customers we had: employees, our advertisers (the paying customers), and our users. From my standpoint, users were on the top of the list because without the users, we’d have no company. So it’s interesting that those who were most removed, in the sense that we had no formal interaction with them—the viewers of our product—were the most important to our success. AT&T was our first paying customer—an advertiser. It was tiny: a $5,000 insertion order. But it was euphoria—our investors were excited, employees were excited. And then we took the order and quickly realized that we didn’t have any technology to place an ad on our server! We had the technology guys going crazy for about a week and a half, but they figured out a way and we got that first banner ad for AT&T running on Lycos.

What was Lycos doing that was different from its competitors? If you went to Lycos, Yahoo, Infoseek, or Excite, the products had more in common than they had apart. But where we differentiated ourselves was less so with technology and more so with the consumer, and that’s brand. We thought of ourselves as the Internet on training wheels. A good way to find your way around was using Lycos, and we worked really hard to position ourselves that way. So we weren’t trying to be the souped-up Maserati (as a VP of mar- keting used to say) that could go 120 miles an hour. And we weren’t trying to be a cramped little Beetle. We liked to think of ourselves in that analogy as the family sedan, the Ford Taurus. Not the sexiest out there, but very purposeful in what we did.

We were PR evangelists of the highest order and were constantly self-promoting. PR is the cheapest form of advertising and it was always pretty powerful for us. It was the most effective way we had to get the word out to customers. We eventually became a large national advertiser: there were Lycos com- mercials, a Lycos race car, Lycos parachutes jumping out of the sky.

I think how much we grew so fast surprised me, and I think the most sat- isfying thing for me was being able to scale the company through all of that growth. We were growing 200 percent to 300 percent a year, every year. People don’t realize that a rapidly growing company is crumbling within and feels pain every hour of every day because nothing works the way it was designed as little as a year before.

In a growth business—which is where you always want to be as an entre- preneur, because it’s a lot more fun than the alternative—things are breaking every day. The accounting system that I used in ’95 was useless in ’98. The sys- tems and the computers that I used weren’t powerful enough 12 months later. The facilities that we would lease weren’t big enough. The data center wasn’t powerful enough to manage the computers we needed. Everything would crumble, and you needed to be one step ahead of that all the time. So amazing growth was a challenge, but it was an awful lot of fun. And it’s important that you do it with perseverance. You do it with a sense of determination and doggedness that says, “I can overcome.”

## Ron Gruner Cofounder, Alliant Computer Systems; Founder, Shareholder.com

_In 1982, Ron Gruner, Craig Mundie, and Rich McAndrew founded Alliant Computer Systems to build parallel supercomputers. Their goal was to build a machine that used multiprocessing to achieve better performance than the fastest single-CPU machines, but in a way that was transparent to developers. In 1985, after 3 years of work, they’d done it, and for the next several years Alliant was one of the leading players in the turbulent parallel computer indus- try. In 1992, he founded Shareholder.com with the goal of using technology to automate the process. Shareholder.com pioneered a new, broader approach toward investor relations. Shareholder.com grew steadily, and in February 2006 was acquired by NASDAQ._

The book The Soul of a New Machine characterizes that environment fairly well. It talks about two competing teams—the Eagle Team and the Fountainhead Team—how they competed internally, and how the Eagle Team eventually won out because they got to market sooner. I was the head of the Fountainhead project. Spending 13 years there was a really good background for me to under- stand a truly entrepreneurial kind of environment.

ou would think that high-performance computers designed out of the most advanced parallel processing technology, with a number of patents behind it, would be a highly differentiated product. In reality, it was just the opposite of that. High-performance computers are the ultimate commodity. The reason is that the customer comes in and says, “Here’s my benchmark; here’s my pro- gram. Run this on your computer and tell me how long it takes to run.” So they wind up buying a computer based on performance divided by dollars, megaflops per dollar. It’s just like buying a tank of gas.

When you miss a generation—when you miss a major product cycle or you’re late significantly, and the competition has caught up with you and they’re providing performance that’s better or the same as yours—you’re at a very sig- nificant loss because that’s really all that matters. We were selling engineering or scientific computers. Ease of use, reliability, and all those things were small factors. The major factor was, “How fast is your machine and what’s it cost?”

The other thing that affected us, that we just simply weren’t smart enough to turn on a dime, was the workstation. It’s a market that’s disappeared now completely, but workstations were personal computers that sat on a desk of an engineer or scientist that they could use for computing rather than having to send their job to a centralized computer facility, run it, and then get the results back the next morning. Workstations began to really take off in the mid ’80s. Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computer pioneered that.

As that was coming, the personal computer was getting faster and faster all the time. So many of our large customers—Bell Labs for example—stopped buying the large computers like Vaxes and our kinds of machines and started buying workstations and personal computers.

One of the things that I think is dogma within venture capital is that you don’t want to manage what they call the “living dead.” I don’t know what the numbers are now, but back when I was working with venture capitalists, their rules of thumb were: typically one out of ten companies is a really big hit; roughly three out of ten go belly up pretty quickly, and you get rid of them. The other five to six are what they call the “living dead.” They grow nicely, organi- cally, but don’t generate spectacular returns, and they take management time and energy. Those are the kinds of companies they prefer not to deal with, because it simply doesn’t make sense. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their limited partners to generate a significant return, so they want to deal with firms that will tend to do that.

And, unfortunately, it didn’t work out. A year later, the company was bank- rupt. Certainly, at the point that I’d left, I’d left a lot of problems for them to clean up. The company was not healthy; it was headed in the wrong direction. So I share a good deal of that responsibility.

At Data General—and Alliant even more so, because it sold computers that were in the half million to one million dollar range to large defense companies, universities, and the govern- ment, who had very sophisticated purchasing agents—we typically generated 80 percent of our revenue the last 2 weeks of the quarter. People don’t believe this today, but it’s true. And we were a public company. So if we had to make $15 million in revenue in a quarter, we’d be 2 weeks from the end of the quarter and we might have $3 million on the books. We were fairly confident we’d close the other $12 mil- lion, but it was horrible.

The second thing was, having been chief executive at Alliant for 10 years, about halfway through that process I realized, “As the boss, I’m spending 40 percent of my time on things that don’t directly contribute to getting com- puters out to customers.” In other words, raising money, dealing with investors, dealing with lawyers, those kinds of issues. So I said, “In the next company I do, I want to be able to spend 98 percent of my time focused on the customer and only 2 percent on secondary factors that lead to that.”

The third requirement, having been through Alliant with all people working in good faith but losing control of the company, I said, “I ain’t going to lose control. I want to be the sole owner. I’m going to be the majority owner of the company. I want to be the sole founder. It may be harder that way because I have to do most of it myself, but I’ve got control.”

My notion for the new company was something I would not have expected when I was at Alliant. It was to go into shareholder communications, which was a micro-niche. I felt the middle tier and the small tier were being ignored, so I thought, “Let me think about starting a company that uses technology to reach out and communicate with shareholders.” That’s how we got started.

I really knew nothing about the industry itself, had no contacts. I was start- ing from scratch. I hired several consultants who knew the industry well, who had been in trade organizations or otherwise had credibility. I had them edu- cate me about the industry and also take me around to opinion leaders in the industry. We talked about what they’d like to have and the opportunities they saw, as well as me talking about my more abstract ideas.

So I had a concept and I’ll tell you how I got it. I had a friend who was a really good programmer, and he told me in the summer of ’92 about a project he had recently done for the Boston Phoenix, the underground newspaper. That project was writing a program to do personal ads over the telephone—personal voicemail ads. People could leave a message saying, “Hi, my name’s Ron Gruner, I’m single, I enjoy this and that, etc.” This is before the Web.

A typical pitch was one we made to IBM, who became a client. We had done some research. We said, “You guys are spending about a million and a half dollars on printing quarterly reports. Every survey that’s been done, including your own, shows that most shareholders think of those as junk mail. We propose to stop sending quarterly reports out. Replace the service with what we call our Shareholder Direct service, so all your interested shareholders only have to make a toll-free call to your 800 number and they can then hear the latest quar- terly results, answers to frequently asked questions; and they can hear an overview of the company. If you choose to, they can hear Lou Gerstner or the chief financial officer commenting about the quarter.

“Based on our analysis of your shareholder base and the demographics, we think that will cost you about a quarter million dollars a year. So you’re spend- ing $1.5 million now. You can take $1.25 million and drop that to bottom line in savings. Spend a quarter million for our service, and the shareholders that are interested in getting the information can get it much faster and in a more per- sonal form than they get it now.”

That’s how we got started. It generated cash immediately, because we charged what we called a “subscription fee.” We didn’t want to call it this, but it was really a retainer fee. We called it a subscription fee, billed in advance every quarter: $4,000 in advance plus a per-minute charge.

And rather than going off and buying all the telephone systems ourselves, which would have been my natural inclination as a technology guy, I outsourced that to a large firm in Omaha called West Interactive. So I had no capital costs. We turned profitable in the summer of 1994.

Campbell’s Soup, for example, was one of our earliest clients, and the first time they had a corporate website was through us. If you look back at their annual report in, I think, ’95, they said, “If you would like shareholder informa- tion, please call 1-800-XXX-SOUP”—that was their Shareholder Direct line— “or visit our website at www.shareholder.com/campbell.”

The initial costs were very low. We would go in and say, “Look, we are investor relations specialists. We know this area very well and we know you have a web development team. But this is a very special- ized area. If you want to do this well, you need real-time SEC feeds and stock quotes. When you put up a news release, it needs to be done”—even back then—“in a few hours. You can’t wait a few days to put a news release up.” So that wasn’t too hard to sell.

In the ’80s and early ’90s, the investor relations officer was really an underappreciated asset. They were understaffed and underbud- geted. So we would go in and say, “Our job is to make your life easier. You send us the information; we’ll take care of it.” And we told them discreetly, “If any- thing gets screwed up, we take the bullet. We’re here to help you.”

We had a couple of things that scared me to death. I think the one that was probably scariest, that definitely could have put us out of business, happened in ’94 or ’95. A very large pharmaceutical company had decided to go with us. We had everything underway, and they were going to announce this new service on their annual report. Everything is fine except that I get a call one afternoon saying, “Ron, we’ve got a really serious problem. The annual report has come out and it’s got the wrong 800 number on it!” There were two issues: one, they had printed over a mil- lion annual reports loaded on pallets at the facility, and two, they had a legal requirement to distribute the reports 30 days before the annual meeting. The reports and the proxies had to be in the shareholders’ hands at least 30 days before the annual meeting, so they were really under the gun. As I recall, they had 5 or 6 days to get those reports in the mail; otherwise they had to reset the annual meeting, and it would have been a huge disaster.

So I called the 800 number and it was going to somebody’s pager. Back in those days, you couldn’t leave a voicemail. It just said, “Please leave a number to call.” So we did that. Nobody ever called back. Because we had a good rela- tionship with AT&T, we identified who owned the 800 number. It was a paging company down in Dallas, Texas.

We called the paging company and without revealing what the situation was specifically, we said, “We have a situation here where we got a number mixed up and your customer will be getting a lot of phone calls he doesn’t want to get. We’d like to make it right by him and by you.” The company wouldn’t give us the time of day. They said, “No. Because of privacy issues, we won’t contact him and you certainly cannot contact him. All you can do is leave a message.” So we tried and tried, and worked it up the ladder. They wouldn’t budge. They were just intractable. This consumed about 2 days. Then Josiah Cushing, one of the college grads I had hired, during our staff meeting said, “Ron, why don’t you try hiring a private detective?”

I said, “Well, let’s try this. It’s an interesting idea.” So I went to the Boston Yellow Pages, looked under “private investigators,” and found an ad that appealed to me. I called the private investigator and I said, “Here’s an 800 num- ber. It belongs to somebody that has a pager. All I need from you is to know the name and the personal phone number of this person.” He said, “No problem. It’ll cost you $100.” And I said, “That’s fine. How long will it take?” He said, “It will probably take about 4 hours.” I thought that was pretty impressive.

He calls back 3 or 4 hours later and said, “Ron, I’ve got good news and bad news.” I said, “Give me the good news first.” “The good news is I’ve got who it is.” “Well, what’s the bad news?” “It’s going to cost you $200, because when we got the name of the person, he had an unlisted number, so we had to do two searches.” I said, “Fine. We’ll send you a check for $200. It will be in tonight’s mail.”

I then call the person up. He is in Dallas, Texas. The whole company was hinging on this, plus the situation with the pharmaceutical company, and I was scared to death about how to make this call. So I just thought, “Be as hon- est as possible,” and I said, “Look, I represent a company that’s printed your number in a document that’s going to be very widespread shortly. Otherwise, they have to republish the whole thing, and it’s a real mess. What I’d like to ask you is: we’d like to acquire your 800 number. Give us the right to that and we’ll do whatever we can do to make it right for you. All you have to do is tell us what you’d like to have us do.” And he said, “I understand. I’ll be happy to help you out. If you could buy me a years’ worth of pager subscriptions, that will be fine.” That was like $400. He could have said $100,000, and they would have done it. He actually said a year, but I said, “No, we’ll give you 2 years. We’ll be happy to do that.”

So we did that and everything was fine, and then he calls back about an hour later. I thought to myself, “Oh my God! He has talked to an attorney. This whole thing is going to get blown off the tracks.” And he said, “You know, I was talking to my wife and she would really like a pager. Could you do the same thing for her?” I said, “Sure.” The long and short of it is, we met a very decent person. He dealt with us fairly. We bought him $500 or $600 worth of subscrip- tions for his pager. We got the number literally within hours because AT&T expedited it for us, and everything worked out. But that was probably the scariest incident we had in these 15 years.

es, we were, but we didn’t fall on the sword too much on that. We basically told them that we got it worked out. I don’t think I even told them we used a private investigator. We absorbed all the costs.

One of our take-aways from that was that you can almost always take a neg- ative situation and turn it to your advantage if you work hard at it. We took something that was a very negative potential situation and made some real friends. Anytime we had a client situation that blew up—and those happen in the business, things go wrong—we would always say, “How do we take this and turn this into a big opportunity, where the client comes back even more loyal than they were before?”

Having been in the computer business, particularly the high- performance, engineering and scientific aspect of it, that’s populated by a lot of early adopters that want the very latest technology, even if it doesn’t quite work. Financial people and investor relations people, and legal people in general, are very conservative. So we had to do a lot of missionary work to have them feel comfortable with the technology.

At Shareholder.com we had several competitors. By far our most serious competitor was also a Boston-based company, called CCBN. CCBN was a very smart company. They were funded by Thomson Financial, a major company in a lot of aspects of corporate services, financial services. They were our arch-competitor. 

For example, we had been pricing our Shareholder Direct service at a fixed cost of $4,000 a quarter, plus telephone fees and other variable charges of the Internet. That $16,000 was highly, highly profitable. That was one of the things that allowed us to grow organically all through the ’90s. But as these new com- petitors are coming in—like I said, about a dozen competitors offering web- sites, webcasting, conference calls, and all kinds of services, financed by $85 million of venture capital—they were going in and just bombing prices and even giving stuff away for free.

We realized that we would have to adjust prices. So we sat down and talked about it and, literally in a day, made the decision to completely restructure our product line and roll that out pretty quickly. That’s the kind of thing that would have been difficult to do in a more complex, let’s say, structure.

So we were able to compete with all these startups—almost all of which went out of business or were acquired. We acquired two, for literally a penny on the dollar. We acquired one firm that had well over $20 million of venture capital invested for a few hundred thousand dollars. They just blew up.

Many of these guys got in the business not understanding shareholder com- munications. Most importantly, not understanding it’s very much a “people” kind of business and that investor relations officers are typically “people” kind of people. Their job is to communicate. So coming in and selling technology— particularly technology as an unknown—was a very hard sell. They had a hard time breaking into the market, whereas we had worked a company at a time.

CCBN did well because they were backed by Thomson Financial. Their key founder, Jeff Parker, had great visibility in that community, and credibility. But everybody else disappeared.

Did you get acquisition offers? They gave us an offer at the time that was valued in the tens of millions of dollars. This was a point where we had revenues of about $3 million. It was denominated in stock. We thought very seriously about it, but basically got cold feet—because at that point we had been doing it for 7 years. We just felt, if the stock collapses, we’ve lost it all.

So that’s why, when we had an offer from NASDAQ—and we had a couple of offers from them; I can’t talk too specifically about it—we felt that it was the right strategy. We’ve known the people for a long time; we’ve had marketing relationships with them; they’re going into corporate services and they’re very sincere about that. They want to use Shareholder.com as the foundation for building their corporate services. They’re keeping the name. The valuation was right. It all happened very quickly.

Somebody told me a long time ago that generally companies are bought, not sold. And that’s what we did. We didn’t hire an investment bank or anything like that to go off and sell us. We just waited for the right opportunity.

Is there anything you might have done differently with Shareholder.com?  Well, I think that bootstrapping the company on a quarter of a million dollars made us a little myopic. We became so proud of that fact that we didn’t find the middle ground. I think that in ’98, ’99, or 2000, we could have taken a million, $2 million of capital, at a very attractive valuation, and retained control and grown the company twice or three times as fast as we did. Perhaps that was a mistake, not doing that. I don’t know, because everything worked out fine. And when you only have so much money, it makes decisions much easier.

Here’s an example: back when the whole Internet thing was getting started, I hired a computer consultant to come in and advise us about what our Internet infrastructure should be. He was a well-credentialed, Microsoft-accredited engineer, etc. He came in and said, “You need to buy x number of servers and this kind of software and all that, and it’s a quarter of a million dollars to do it right.”

We said we couldn’t even come close to doing that. So I went down to Barnes & Noble, bought several books, including some of the Dummy series. And we built our first Internet servers, which lasted us several years, on Gateway desktop computers, using Microsoft Access as our database system and using basically off-the-shelf server software. We did that for $3 [thousand] or 4,000, and it worked great.

Was there ever a time at Shareholder.com when you wanted to quit? No, not really. I really enjoyed most every day. I enjoyed driving into work, looked forward to it. Every company has its pros and cons. The nice aspect of Shareholder.com was that it was indeed a recurring revenue stream. So we had almost no financial worries. We could predict our quarterly revenues within a couple of percent the first day of the quarter.

The worries that we had came from the fact that we were basically in the news business. When earnings season came out, we might be doing 50 earnings calls and webcasts and news releases on the same day. Every one had to be done on time and perfectly, because an earnings release, for all intents and pur- poses, is a legal document. So where we sweated was just managing that process. It’s like running 50 television stations at the same time.

If you screwed up, it was very visible. On rare occasions we did. We might get one webcast mixed up with another company. We’d fix it within 3 or 4 min- utes, but it’s extremely embarrassing. And, believe me, chief executives don’t like that at all.

I’d be the one to call up and apologize, and that was just part of the job. Most people were very reasonable, and they would understand—things go wrong. I would use the analogy of a cell phone (that was when cell phones were really getting hot). I’d say, “Look, we’ve all got cell phones or car phones. Sometimes they just screw up and they go wrong. And this is the same kind of stuff; this is pretty advanced technology and sometimes things go wrong.”

## Jessica Livingston Cofounder, Y Combinator

_Jessica Livingston founded Y Combinator in 2005 with Paul Graham, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell. Y Combinator developed a new approach to ven- ture funding: to fund startups in batches, giving them just enough money to get started, working closely with them to refine their ideas, and then introducing them to later stage investors for further funding. In three years they have funded more than 100 startups._

There was no process. Remember, Y Combinator started off as an experiment. Paul had wanted to do angel investing. He wanted to help people start companies. But he didn’t really want all the requirements that come with being an angel investor, so he thought he should start an organization that could handle all of this for him. I said, “That sounds interesting. I’d love to work with entrepreneurs.” So we sort of hatched this idea for Y Combinator, and I was the one in charge of doing a lot of the business stuff.

The idea with Y Combinator was that we were going to invest small amounts of money in startups and help them get set up legally, just like Viaweb had been helped out by Paul’s friend Julian. Get them set up, work closely with them on their products, and then introduce them to investors to hopefully get more funding.

I remember when we first got started, we thought, “How do we even tell people about this?” So Paul built a website—I think he stayed up all night building it. We had a couple pages online that loosely described what we were planning to do—we didn’t really fully know what we were planning to do—and we had an application, with about 20 questions on it, and then Paul launched it on paulgraham.com, which had a lot of traffic because of his essays. We started getting some applications in. I was still working at the time, and I remember Paul saying, “We have some good applications, you better quit your job.”

We got a lot of applications, more than we thought we would. And then we chose about 20 groups to come to Cambridge to interview—over a Saturday and Sunday, all day long. On Sunday night we called everyone. We chose eight that we had wanted to fund, and all of them but one said yes. I give the founders a lot of credit, because this was a brand new concept and Y Combinator had no track record. The deal was: move to Cambridge for the summer and get $12,000 or $18,000, depending on whether you were two or three founders. We based the amount of money on the MIT graduate student stipend, which was a couple grand a month. We said, “Come to Cambridge and we’ll work with you, and we’ll get together for dinner and hear from guest speakers every week.”

But that day something else very memorable happened. There had been one group, two guys from UVA, who were still seniors and were graduating that spring—Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman. They came to us with an idea that we just thought was wrong for two young guys with no connections in the fast food industry. Their idea was ordering fast food through your cell phone. And we didn’t fund them. We told them, “Sorry, we really liked you guys, but we just think your idea would be a bit too challenging.” But that morning when I was at work, Paul called them and said, “We like you guys. Would you be willing to work on another idea?” They were on an Amtrak train heading back to Virginia. I remember Paul emailed me and the subject line was “muffins saved.” I had nicknamed them “the muffins,” because I just loved them. It was just sort of an affectionate name.

Do you remember anyone else in that first batch? Looking back, it was an amazing group that we had. Sam Altman of Loopt was in that batch. There’s actually a funny story about him, too. He had submitted an application and at the time he’d been working with a few other people, but he was the only one who could come to Cambridge that summer. So Sam emailed us saying he was the only one who could come and Paul wrote back to him, saying, “You know, Sam, you’re only a freshman. You have plenty of time to start a startup. Why don’t you just apply later?” 

He wound up winning on Saturday and he took the red-eye to Boston that night and arrived for his interview—just him—on Sunday. We met with him for 25 minutes or so and I remember thinking in the first 5 minutes, “This guy is amazing.” All of us were just blown away by Sam. His poise and intelli- gence, and just the way he was. We knew that there was something special about him.

We also had Justin Kan and Emmett Shear of Justin.tv. We originally funded them to make an online calendar called Kiko. They built it that summer and got a little bit of angel funding, but Google Calendar came out soon after and crushed them. So they came to us later on and said, “I think we’re gonna move on from Kiko,” and they started talking to Paul and Robert about new ideas. I remember I walked in and Paul said, “Hey, Jessica, listen to their new idea. Justin’s going to wear a camera on his head 24 hours a day and film his entire life.” I thought this was one of the craziest ideas I’d ever heard. But Y Combinator funded them because we really liked them, and Paul, Robert, and Trevor liked their idea.

Do you remember learning anything surprising that summer? I learned a lot that summer, because it was our first run at every- thing. Looking back, I think the most surprising thing was all the convincing we had to do that this idea of Y Combinator—providing small amounts of funding to batches of startups—would work. It had never been done before, so every- thing was brand new. I tell founders this all the time—that if your idea has never been done before, everyone will think it’s crazy.

Was there anything that surprised you about startups, since you’d been working at a big company before? I was surprised how much people could create in a short time. There were only about 10 weeks before Demo Day, when the startups present to investors, and every one of these groups started from square one. None of them had a working product before YC. So it amazed me how much they accomplished. Sometimes they’d come to dinner and say, “This is the first time I’ve left the house in 2 days.” I’d never really seen that before. They could build something in a week that would’ve taken an IT department in a big company 6 months—with about 20 different meetings to approve things.

Also, I saw all the stuff startups would do to pretend to be bigger than they actually were. It was new for me to be behind the scenes with startups. I remember Alexis of Reddit would—this is a 2-month-old company that had just launched—email reporters saying he was going on a “media tour” to San Francisco and would they like to meet with him? Reporters were like, “Yeah, we’d love to meet you.” I’d done PR for a long time and it was so amusing to me that this 21-year-old startup founder could just email reporters at important publications pretending to be a big deal.

The biggest milestone for Y Combinator after the first summer batch was when we decided to move out to Silicon Valley for the winter. I remember not being too excited about that idea at first. Paul said, “You know, we should do this out in Silicon Valley,” and I thought, “Dammit, we just got everything set up, working well here in Cambridge. Do I really want to uproot my entire life and move out to California?” But it turned out to be one of the best things we’ve ever done.

So what happens when a startup comes to Y Combinator? Walk me through the process. I help them get set up legally. The paperwork can be intimidating to anyone who hasn’t done it before, but it’s really important to be done right. Like being sure your company owns all of its IP, or that you have vesting set up so your cofounder can’t quit 6 months into things and walk away with 30 per- cent of the company. Most hackers don’t like to worry about this stuff, but it can cause real trouble later if it’s not dealt with properly.

My partners begin working with them immediately on their idea. It’s amaz- ing how much the ideas evolve from the time of the interview to Demo Day. That’s what we spend the most time on. In some cases, we even encourage them to ditch the idea and start over. This is hard given the short amount of time before Demo Day, but it has definitely been done successfully.

The most “formal” parts of Y Combinator besides Demo Day are the weekly dinners. Each Tuesday, all the founders come to our office for dinner, and there’s a guest speaker. We bring in experts from all parts of the startup world to share advice and offer feedback. Talks are always off the record, so the speakers are very candid. We’ve heard a lot of stories that have never been published.

We’ve found the dinners are really good for the founders’ morale. Paul used to cook the dinners himself. Usually bean-type dishes, so it’s always very healthy. Because dinners are the same day every week, they end up being a sort of milestone. Founders say it gives them an incentive to get something concrete done—a new feature or something. People bring their computers to show what they built over the week.

This all leads up to the most important day, Demo Day. This is when the startups present to investors. They each have about 7 minutes, so they have to be good. A week before Demo Day, we have Rehearsal Day, which is basically a dress rehearsal for the next week. We give them feedback on the content of their presentations as well as the delivery. Hackers aren’t usually the best when it comes to presentation skills, but we work really hard with them to make sure they are impressive. I am always so proud of how much effort the founders put in. You can tell they care a lot. As they should, since it’s their introduction to pretty much the whole investment community.

Have you gotten better at recognizing which founders are likely to succeed? We have learned that determination matters a lot more than founders’ resumes or where they went to college. I’d say that determination is the most important quality in a startup founder, because we’ve seen so many of the start- ups hit difficult times, and some of them quit and some of them don’t. It’s hard to keep going.
