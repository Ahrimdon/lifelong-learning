## Foreword

The earliest phase is usually the most produc- tive. That’s when they have the really big ideas. Imagine what Apple was like when 100 percent of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.

he striking thing about this phase is that it’s completely different from most people’s idea of what business is like. If you looked in people’s heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing “business,” you’d get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, PowerPoint presentations, and people producing thick reports for one another to read. Early-stage startups are the exact opposite of this. And yet they’re probably the most productive part of the whole economy.

I think there’s a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appear- ances to compensate. More often than not, the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse.

Business is broken the same way that car was. The effort that goes into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes organizations less productive. 

Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what passes for productivity in big companies. And yet conventional ideas of “professional- ism” have such an iron grip on our minds that even startup founders are affected by them.

In fact, programming didn’t get done by well-dressed people at clean desks during office hours. It got done by badly dressed people (I was notorious for program- ming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn with junk at 2:00 in the morning.

## Introduction

Some kind of magic happens in startups, especially at the very beginning, but the only people there to see it are the founders. The best way to understand what happens is to ask them, so that’s what I did.

What surprised me most was how unsure the founders seemed to be that they were actually onto something big. Some of these companies got started almost by accident. The world thinks of startup founders as having some kind of superhuman confidence, but a lot of them were uncertain at first about starting a company. What they weren’t uncertain about was making something good— or trying to fix something broken.

They all were determined to build things that worked. In fact, I’d say deter- mination is the single most important quality in a startup founder. If the founders I spoke with were superhuman in any way, it was in their persever- ance. That came up over and over in the interviews.

Perseverance is important because, in a startup, nothing goes according to plan. Founders live day to day with a sense of uncertainty, isolation, and some- times lack of progress. Plus, startups, by their nature, are doing new things— and when you do new things, people often reject you.

That was the second most surprising thing I learned from these interviews: how often the founders were rejected early on. By investors, journalists, estab- lished companies—they got the Heisman from everyone. People like the idea of innovation in the abstract, but when you present them with any specific inno- vation, they tend to reject it because it doesn’t fit with what they already know.

As Howard Aiken said, “Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.”

People think startups grow out of some brilliant initial idea like a plant from a seed. But almost all the founders I interviewed changed their ideas as they developed them. PayPal started out writing encryption software, Excite started as a database search company, and Flickr grew out of an online game.

Successful startup founders typically get rich from the process, but the ones I interviewed weren’t in it just for the money. They had a lot of pride in crafts- manship. And they wanted to change the world. That’s why most have gone on to new projects that are just as ambitious. Sure, they’re pleased to have more financial freedom, but the way they choose to use it is to keep building more things.

In its plain form, pro- ductivity looks so weird that it seems to a lot of people to be “unbusinesslike.” But if early-stage startups are unbusinesslike, then the corporate world might be more productive if it were less businesslike.

## Max Levchin Cofounder, PayPal

_PayPal went public in early 2002 and was acquired later that year by eBay for $1.5 billion. PayPal was started during the Internet Bubble, but it was in no sense a Bubble startup. Its success was a direct reflection of the intelligence of the people who built it. In large
part, PayPal succeeded because it could deal with fraud—and its competitors couldn’t.

My focus in college was security. I wanted to do crypto and stuff like that. I had already founded three different companies during college and the year after, which I spent in Champaign-Urbana, where I went to school. I went to see this random lecture at Stanford—given by a guy named Peter, who I had heard about, but never met before. The lecture turned out to have only six people in it. I called Peter and said, “This investment is a great thing, but I have no one to run the company. I’m just going to write the code and recruit the coders.” The next 2 weeks we were sort of playing with the idea, and by 1/1/99 we agreed that he would be the CEO and I would be the CTO.

This idea that I had in college, which I was vaguely successful with—if you’ve ever seen these authen- tication devices, like a little card that spits out numbers at you that you can log in with. In college one day I had bought all the different kinds of cards. They weren’t that difficult to reverse- engineer because you already know the standard, so you know it can’t be too far outside the standard.

Once I got them all reverse-engineered, I wrote an emulator for every single type of them for a Palm Pilot. I had a lot of friends on campus who were really into security as well—most of them were sys admins—and they carried a whole bunch of these things in their pockets, because most of the time you can only use one per computer, per system. 

Then finally we hit on this idea of, “Why don’t we just store money in the handheld devices?” The next iteration was this thing that would do crypto- graphically secure IOU notes.

Then we had the famous Buck’s beaming—at Buck’s restaurant in Woodside, which is sort of the home away from home for many VCs. Our first round of financing was actually transferred to us via Palm Pilot. Our VCs showed up with a $4.5 million preloaded Palm Pilot, and they beamed it to us.

The product wasn’t really finished, and about a week before the beaming at Buck’s I realized that we weren’t going to be able to do it, because the code wasn’t done. Obviously it was really simple to mock it up—to sort of go, “Beep! Money is received.” But I was so disgusted with the idea. We have this security company; how could I possibly use a mock-up for something worth $4.5 mil- lion? What if it crashes? What if it shows something? I’ll have to go and commit ritual suicide to avoid any sort of embarrassment. So instead of just getting the mock-up done and getting reasonable rest, my two coders and I coded nonstop for 5 days. I think some people slept; I know I didn’t sleep at all. It was just this insane marathon where we were like, “We have to get this thing working.”

It was one of these things where you can’t just be done. With crypto, if you are one bit off, nothing’s going to work. We started testing at midnight the night before and fixed all the bugs and tested more. There were definitely some memory leaks, but it was secure. It was one of these things where the software wasn’t perfect, but the security path where the money changed hands was defi- nitely provably secure. The danger was that the Palm Pilots might crash, but the transaction was perfectly safe. I could have bet my own life on the transac- tion. The thing that was not safe was just the software was not really perfect. It was clunky; I was worried that it might crash.

Sometime by early 2000, we realized that all these people were trying to use the website for transactions, and the growth of that was actually more impressive than the growth of the handheld device one, which was inexplicable, because the handheld device one was cool and the website was just a demo.

We tried to attack the system for ourselves, like a good security person would. How can you cheat and steal money and do whatever? We made some provisions from day one to prevent fraud. We prevented all the obvious fraud, and then, I think 6 months into it, we saw the first chargeback and were like, “Ah, one per week. OK.” Then it was like an avalanche of losses; 2000 was basi- cally the year of fraud, where we were just losing more and more and more money every month. At one point we were losing over $10 million per month in fraud. It was crazy.

ut then eventually I became interested in the economics of PayPal and trying to see what’s going on in the back end, because I was getting distracted from code and technology. I realized that we were losing a lot more money in fraud than I thought we were.

o I started freaking out over it, and this intern and I wrote all sorts of pack- ages—very statistical stuff—to analyze “How did it happen; how do we lose money?” By the end of the summer, we thought, “The world is going to end any minute now.” It was obvious that we were really losing tons of money. By mid- summer, it was already on a $10 million range per month and just very scary.

Bob and I built this package called IGOR.  So we built this tool—actually we have a patent on it now—and it was very impressive. It’s based on the assumption of all sorts of convoluted guesses on our part, but the guesses turn out to be mostly right. 

We realized that the way we were attacking these things was just funda- mentally flawed. So Bob and I built this system that was part visualization pack- age, part graph balancing tool, that would try to represent large-scale travels of money in the system in a visual form. Taking that as a base, we built all these different tools that would allow computers to predict where particularly expen- sive losses would be and then represent the networks of losses to the investiga- tors in such a way that they could very quickly make a decision whether or not to pursue a particular case.

It’s one of those things where, in the end, fraud is so nondeterministic that you need a human or a quantum computer to look at it and sort of make a final decision, because, in the end, it’s people’s money. You don’t really want some computer saying, “$2.00 for you, nothing for you.” You need a human with a brain to say, “Hmm. This looks like fraud, but I really don’t think it is.”

We never really showed IGOR to anyone. We never talked about it in the press. I was definitely very paranoid. Initially, when we built it, we had a conference room where there was the IGOR terminal, and people would go in there, use it, and leave. There were no other copies available.Q

 I didn’t really want to patent it because, for one, I don’t like software patents, and, two, if you patent it, you make it public. Even if you don’t know someone’s infringing, they will still be getting the benefit. Instead, we just chose to keep it a trade secret and not show it to anyone.
After a while, IGOR became well known to the company, like all the other tools that we had built early on. We had patented some of it, and some of it we said, “OK, it’s open for wide use now.” There’s still a whole bunch of tools that they are using today that are not public. They don’t talk about it much at all, and I think that’s a good thing.

I think a good way to describe PayPal is: a security company pretend- ing to be a financial services company. What PayPal does is judge the risk of a transaction and then occasionally actually take the risk on. You don’t really know the money’s good; you just sort of assess the riskiness of both parties, and you say, “I’ll be the intermediary with the understanding that, on occasion, PayPal will be on the hook for at least part of the loss if the loss occurs.” Which is very tricky; it’s a hard position to be in.

So the company’s core expertise, by definition, has to be in this ability to judge risk—to be able to say, “Is this the kind of transaction I really want to take on or is this something I should steer away from because you people look like thieves?” I think that’s the security part.

The really complicated part is figuring out the risk. The financial industry people understood the risk, but they weren’t willing to do the sort of stuff we did, where they would basically say, “Bad guys over here. Let’s get all the bad guys out.”

There are tools to just say, “Give me your social security number, give me your address and your mother’s maiden name, and we send you a physical piece of paper and you sign it and send it back to us.” By the time that’s all accom- plished, you are a very safe user. But by then you are also not a user, because for every step you have to take, the dropoff rate is probably 30 percent. If you take ten steps, and each time you lose one-third of the users, you’ll have no users by the time you’re done with the fourth step.

There was always something, every day. I could not sleep well for 4 years. If you are in charge of technology at a really fast-growing company that gets lots of publicity, there’s always something that worries you. In early 2000, it was scalability. We had a few days when the site was down. Even though we were adding servers and rewriting code to be more scalable, at a certain point the original design was starting to crack. It was kind of painful.

It’s one of those things where you have to fly by the seat of your pants all the time. It would be nice to test some hardware and set up a big lab: “We have x systems now; let’s 2x the systems and get twice the amount of hardware and see if it can scale.” But, it doesn’t work that way because, by the time you are done testing 2x, the real system is 3x because the growth is so fast. We were get- ting 20,000 new active users every day. The transactional growth is exponential because people are sticking around. It’s not like people came in, did one thing, and left. They came in, did one thing, and stayed. And they kept doing more.

We built the system to be viral from day one. The idea was: I can send you the money, even if you aren’t a member. If I send you $10, you get an email saying, “You have $10 waiting for you. Sign up, and you can take it.” That’s the most powerful viral driver there is. Free money available to you.

For eBay buyers and sellers, it became this crazy loop where buyers would be like, “I want to pay you with PayPal,” and sellers would be like, “I don’t accept PayPal.” And buyers would say, “That’s OK. I’ll just send you $10, and you can sign up.” So the seller would get infected, and the seller would say, “Oh, this is really simple, so I only accept PayPal.”

Try to have a good cofounder. I think it’s all about people, and, if you are doing it completely alone, it’s really hard. It’s not impossible, in particular if you are a loner and introverted type, but it’s still really hard.
One of the ways PayPal changed me is that I used to be really introverted, and I sort of still am, but not anywhere near to the extent that I used to be. But, you only can count on energy sources and support sources from yourself. There’s really no one else who you can go to and say, “Hey, this thing is going to fall apart any minute now. What the hell are we going to do?”

I have this IQ bias—anybody really smart, I will figure out a way to deal with. We would constantly try to come up with ones that the other person wouldn’t be able to solve. I’m really into puzzles. I’m not a very quick solver, so I tend to take a long time. Not always, but on occasion, I will take a lot longer than an average time to solve it, but I almost always will succeed.

There are different segments to running a startup. Different people taught me different things. A lot of the top management people at PayPal were really good. It was very fun and meaningful to work with them and pick up their various interests and skills.

It’s one of these things where, if you look back now, when everyone walked away with a ton of money, everyone loves everyone. The company’s not doing well; they’ve overpaid and they’ve been too nice. It’s half and half. I think I was blissfully spared a lot of it because Peter managed the board much more than I did.

What can big companies do to preserve a startup culture? Less PowerPoints. I think PayPal—even by the time we were acquired—still felt really startup in a variety of ways.

I think the hallmark of a really good entrepreneur is that you’re not really going to build one specific company. The goal—at least the way I think about entrepreneur- ship—is you realize one day that you can’t really work for anyone else. You have to start your own thing. It almost doesn’t matter what that thing is. We had six different business plan changes, and then the last one was PayPal.

If that one didn’t work out, if we still had the money and the people, obvi- ously we would not have given up. We would have iterated on the business model and done something else. I don’t think there was ever any clarity as to who we were until we knew it was working. By then, we’d figured out our PR pitch and told everyone what we do and who we are. 

## Sabeer Bhatia

_they came up with the idea of email accounts that could be accessed anonymously through a web browser. This idea became the startup. In 1996, the first web-based email was born, offering people free email accounts that could be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection. On New Year’s Eve, 1997, Microsoft acquired Hotmail for $400 million._

Our manager left the company to join a startup in the Valley called FirePower Systems. Jack and I knew Apple would have given us steady, stable employment, but it wasn’t with grand stock options. So we decided to leave Apple and join this startup.

We worked very hard, cranking out products: chips that were used to design PCs that ran on the PowerPC processor. But what hap- pened over time is that Intel itself caught up on the price/performance curve.

Two of my colleagues from Stanford had gone on to start Yahoo, and I thought, “Wow. This is just a list, a directory which tells you what is where. And somebody put $1 million in them.” And somebody put $1 million in them.” I mean, that was huge. So I thought, “This Internet thing is here to stay,” and I started playing around with it and came up with the idea to do a simple-to-install database at the back end. Then you’d use the browser as the front end. It could store any piece of information at the back, but the browser would be used to display it. So people could just look for it and be able to create a personal database of anything: con- tact information, phone numbers, special files, or whatever it is that you would do on a local PC.

No, we were actually both working, so we decided to spend all of the time on the weekends and evenings building this product. Then it came to a point that one of us had to quit our job to focus full-time on it, so I told Jack, “I’m single and don’t have a family. Why don’t you quit and start working on this and I’ll give you half of my salary?” So at least he could support his family. I did- n’t need that much money.

We went to a number of VCs and many of them turned us down because they were like, “How are you going to make money if you are going to give it away for free? What’s the revenue mechanism?” We said we would capture detailed demographic information about people and that detailed quality of information on individuals would help us advertise to them. But of course advertising was not a proven revenue model at that time.

 While we were putting the business plan for JavaSoft together and were working at FirePower Systems, they installed a firewall around our corpo- rate intranet that prevented us from dialing out to our personal email accounts. I had an account at Stanford and Jack had one at AOL, so we would dial out and email each other. But we couldn’t do that anymore because the firewall pre- vented us from accessing our personal accounts. So we ended up exchanging information on floppy disks and on physical pieces of paper. That’s when it occurred to us, “Wait a minute, we can access any website in the world through a web browser. If we made email available through the web browser, that would solve our problem.”

That we could access our email from only two places: our homes and our work. And while we were at work, we could not access our per- sonal email accounts. Our plan was to use the JavaSoft idea to get money from venture capitalists. But actually the killer arrow in our quiver was always email because we thought that it was even bigger than the original idea.

etscape was building email servers. What if the VCs were just to say to them, “Hey, why don’t you do web-based email?” And that’s it, that’s the idea, right? There was not that much to protect in terms of IP. Whoever built it first
would win the market.
So we were afraid and that’s why we kept that as the secret. But we were
going to do web-based email no matter what, even if we got funding for the other idea.

We actually planned to do this. You can’t get an audience with any ven- ture capitalist without sharing a business plan, but we didn’t want our business plan floating around somewhere with the email idea. So we would go in with the JavaSoft business plan. If they passed the litmus test of not rejecting us for the wrong reasons and said, “OK, we don’t mind that you’re young, we don’t mind that you don’t have management experience,” only when they would start poking holes in the actual idea would we share the Hotmail idea with them. 

They said, “We’re going to get one of our partners to come in and take a look at this because it could be big.” We finally settled on a 15 percent split with them and they valued the company at $2 million post money. But they’d put in a right of first refusal. Since I was a young entrepreneur at the time, I didn’t under- stand that this basically meant that you couldn’t go to any other VC. It impeded our ability to go to another VC. What ended up happening was that we could not get a higher valuation because DFJ wanted to put more money in the company themselves. So any time we would talk to another VC, they would talk him out of it:

they’re a good VC firm in the sense that they try to put deals together. But sometimes they don’t play by the rules.

Nobody knows this, but the round before the deal with Microsoft, they lit- erally put $5 million in the company just because they knew it was going to get sold and that we needed some bridge money. They knew full well that we were going to get acquired; we were negotiating about the final price.

We got funded on February 14, 1996, and the site launched on the Fourth of July. We had 100,000 subscribers in the first 3 months and we were growing very rapidly from then on. We were literally getting 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 sign-ups every day. It all spread by word of mouth. We launched a massive PR campaign with a PR firm and started talking to different journalists. We did a West Coast and East Coast press tour, and it just took off from there.

You had a tagline in the body of the email encouraging email recip- ients to set up their own free Hotmail accounts. How did you come up with this? It was actually Jack’s idea to do that. We ran it by our VCs just to make sure it was OK. When you alter somebody’s email, you’ve got to be very careful. You’re sending an email to a friend of yours, and we are kind of violating the sanctity of that email by putting in a tagline at the end of it that says “This mes- sage has been sent from Hotmail. Get your free email at hotmail.com.”

How did you convince people you could make money from tar- geted advertising? It was novel, but at the same time it wasn’t novel, because Yahoo had gotten funding (and later went public) on that basis. Their whole concept was to grow by advertising, even though it was a directory, because people would pay for advertising. What has happened in the last 10 years is that advertising has grown even more. It’s not just page impressions, but the number of click-throughs. The most monetizable part of advertising (at least online advertising today) is the click-through to another advertiser, which is search. When people search, they’re most likely to click through because that’s when they’re looking for something.

It takes a long time before you can break through to an advertiser and get them to start paying you. In fact, the first 3 or 4 months we were doing advertising for our advertisers for free. We had them give us their banners, just to show that this was a mechanism for people to get their product in front of millions and millions of consumers.

Ads were perceived to be kind of a negative. And that’s the reason why, when there used to be 25 search engines, only 2 or 3 have survived. The others have died because they made their front pages look like Las Vegas casinos as opposed to preserving that sim- ple, clean interface that Google has. I think the strategy that Google took was far better. They earned the trust of the end consumer.

Did Hotmail ever become profitable from advertising? No, we didn’t become profitable. But we weren’t losing that much money. We found that we were not the best at selling ads, so we outsourced the whole thing to another company and said, “You guys go sell the ads for us. We’ll just focus on delivering these ads to you no matter how much you sell them for. hat minimum commitment they gave us, which was about $1 million per month, was alone sufficient for us to break even. Our costs were so low; we were spending about $1 million a month.

efore we launched, I think the first major turning point was getting the $300,000 in funding. That was huge for us—two young kids to get that much money. The second turning point really was when I started using it and I told my friends and family about it and everybody who used the product (50 or 100 or so people) loved it. 

Was there ever a time when you thought you were in trouble? The only time was when we had to go in for the second round of financ- ing. We didn’t have any money and Tim was at the Olympics in Atlanta and he refused to fund us because we wanted a slightly higher valuation. We had only a couple of weeks worth of money left and I would not have been able to meet the next payroll. So as soon as he came back, we literally had to accept his terms and move on. 

Who were you most nervous about from a competitive standpoint? We were most nervous about compa- nies like Netscape, because Netscape was building email servers and they would provide web-based access to the servers. Their whole point was that they provided web-based management to servers that you could set up. So, as sys- tem administrators, you could check to see how many had people signed up or whatever, but they were not offering web-based mail to people.

The good news was that a lot of people said, “I’m not sure email is a browser-based product. Email is best done on an email client like Outlook Express. It doesn’t belong in the browser.” That’s what Jerry Yang said at Yahoo. We were like, “Great!”

Talks with Microsoft started after our first anniversary, which was July 1997. In August or so, Microsoft contacted us and said, “Wow, this is really big. Do you really have 7 million subscribers?” We worked out a detailed business plan about how we would provide email to their subscribers, and then they said they wanted a tighter relationship between us and their company—that they wanted to invest in our company. So they looked at our business plan and saw very quickly that we wanted to be more than just an email company. We wanted to incorporate all of the other functions as well, such as personalized news and those kinds of things. 

They called us to meet with Bill on October 13, 1997, and we were shown the Microsoft campus, headquarters, the whole works. We were taken to Bill’s office, met with him, and then we were taken to a room with a gigantic table, and there were about 15 Microsoft negotiators sitting on the other side: business development people, lawyers, accountants, all of them. They gave a presentation about how much they liked the company and this and that, and they said they wanted to buy us and placed an offer of $160 mil- lion. I said, “Thank you very much for making an offer. We really, really like your company and like the fact that you like us so much. We’ll go back to our board and discuss this and get back to you.”

What drove you to keep on negotiating until you got the $400 million? Once you’ve got a lead in terms of a subscriber base, that is unassail- able. It can’t be replicated easily. So I knew even if they started developing the product—I have no doubt in my mind that they could have developed it, so many engineers and smart people in Microsoft. At that time they had some- thing like 16,000 engineers, and I had a total of 60 people in the company, only 14 engineers, so it would have been easy to pick 15 guys from 16,000 and build this product. But I knew we had that momentum behind us and that is very hard to replicate.

Once you have tasted this kind of success, once you’ve tasted that it works, that you’ve got subscribers who are telling you it’s good, you know you are going to get there. In fact, that’s exactly what’s happened. That 6-month lead that we had already over any of our competitors today has translated into about a 50 to 100 million–user lead. Seeing how they did a lousy job of providing email to their 2.5 million sub- scribers, I also knew that they didn’t have the technology in house. Because if they did, they wouldn’t have been asking to license this from us. 

I think I knew that Hotmail was going to become successful one day. I was just shocked that all of that happened in a span of 20 months from start to finish. Those kinds of things don’t happen very often; from the time you start to the time you see an exit in less than 2 years. 

Let me tell you one other thing about the Internet: there are thousands of such ideas under our noses even as we speak. Why things happen, I just don’t know. Maybe somebody has a need and, in our case, we had a need. That’s what triggered the idea.

The one lesson that I’ve learned in my experience while I did Hotmail and since I’ve done Hotmail is you have got to own the customer. The customers came to us for free at Hotmail. Even though they were free customers, what the last 10 to 15 years of my experience of the Internet has taught me is that it’s OK if you don’t monetize them right up front. Eventually you will be able to.

The general piece of advice, which is fairly mundane and oft repeated, is: make sure you write a business plan because it will crystallize your thoughts to communicate your ideas with somebody else. Make sure that once you have written your business plan, you have somebody read and critique it and ask you questions.

Second is, don’t try to change user behavior dramatically. For example, the reason that Hotmail succeeded was because people were accus- tomed to going to different websites. All they had to do was put in their name and password and a little bit of information and they got an email account. So in that regard, it was the ease of use of getting online and having an identity.

The other reason why Hotmail became kind of like its own phenomenal PR was every time somebody sent an email out, it was sent from @hotmail.com. That’s of huge branding value, to have that moniker in people’s email IDs. So when people would give a business card to somebody that said @hotmail.com, it perpetuated the brand.

You were a programmer. How did you learn how to write a busi- ness plan? One of the natural talents that I believe I have is the ability to communicate. A business plan is nothing more than your own communication to a person not sitting in front of you—an imaginary person who will read it. Try to answer every possible question that that person could raise. That’s the description of a business plan, really.

## Steve Wozniak Cofounder, Apple Computer

_when you meet Woz in person, you realize another equally miraculous aspect of his character. A programmer might describe it by saying he’s good in hardware._

Even back in high school I knew I could design computers with half as many chips as the companies were selling them with. I taught myself, but I had taught myself in a way that forced me to learn all sorts of trickiness. Because you try to make valuable what you’re good at. I was good at making things with very few parts by using all sorts of tricks—almost the equivalent of mathematics—so I valued products that were made with very few parts.

That helped in two ways. When you are a startup or an individual on your own, you don’t have very much money, so the fewer parts you have to buy, the better. When you design with very few parts, everything is so clean and orderly you can understand it more deeply in your head, and that causes you to have fewer bugs. You live and sleep with every little detail of the product.

hen I came home from work, I kept doing electronics anyway. I didn’t do the same calculators we were doing at work, but I got involved through other people with the earliest home pinball games, hotel movies . . .I was kind of in with Atari and they recognized me for my design talents, so they wanted to hire me.

I said, “No, I’m never going to leave Hewlett-Packard. It’s my job for life. It’s the best company because it’s so good to engineers.” It really treated us like we were a community and family, and everyone cared about everyone else. Engineers—bottom-of-the-org-chart people—could come up with the ideas that would be the next hot products for the company. Everything was open to thought, discussion, and innovation. So I would never leave Hewlett-Packard. I was going to be an engineer for life there.

Then I designed a game for Atari called Breakout, and that was a really incredible product. That was just so neat, to have my name associated with a product that actually came out in the field in video games.

I just saw somebody typ- ing away on the teletype, just talking about playing chess with a computer in Boston, and I said, “I have to do this. I just have to have this for myself.” For a lot of entrepreneurs, they see something and they say, “I have to have this,” and that will start them building their own.

I couldn’t really afford to buy the pieces I needed. I couldn’t buy a teletype, so I had to design my own terminal. The only thing that was free (because I had no money) was a home TV to see characters on. I got a keyboard for $60, which was amazingly low-priced then. That was the most expensive thing to getting my terminal built. Then it was just a matter of designing logic to put dots on a TV screen that add up to the letters of the alphabet and spell out what’s coming from another computer far away. The keyboard types the data to the computer far away, and I built a modem for that. So now I had a TV terminal. This is while I’m working at Hewlett-Packard. I’m just doing these things on the side for fun in my apartment in Cupertino.

Back in college, I had designed a neat deal called a blue box, for making free phone calls. Steve Jobs came along and said, “Let’s sell it.” So now I had this video terminal, and he said, “There’s a local time-sharing outfit that buys these expensive terminals. Why don’t we sell this to them?” So we actually sold some of the video terminals that I had built. It was to become a portion of the Apple I.

I had wanted a computer my whole life. Back in high school I told my dad, “I’m going to have a computer someday.” And he said that it cost as much as a house—the down payment on a house. And I said, “Well, I’ll live in an apart- ment.” But I was going to have a computer someday. So it starts with a huge dedication. You start with a lot of motives and values and who you are going to be in life.

Now, I still was in this mode where I had to build everything for free. Then I discovered that microprocessors had come out. I had sort of slipped out of the electronics world, out of the computer world, due to working in calculators at Hewlett-Packard. All of a sudden I discovered these microprocessors. What are they? I didn’t quite understand it fully, so I took a datasheet home.

I looked at the Altair computer that started the whole thing going. It was the first microcomputer, but it wasn’t really a computer. To me, I needed one thing. In high school, I told my dad that I was going to have a 4K Data General Nova. Why 4K? 4K bytes of memory. The reason is that’s the minimum computer to run a programming language. You’ve got to be able to program in Fortran or Basic, or some language to get your programs done. The Altair that was being sold at a ridiculously low price, all it was was a glorified microproces- sor from Intel, with some chips to protect the voltages.

My thinking was always, in making something possi- ble, you’ve got to get it down to a reasonable cost, but I needed 4K bytes of RAM minimum. The first dynamic RAMs got introduced that year, 1975—the first 4K dynamic RAMs. That was the first time ever that RAMs were lower in price than magnetic core memories, which every computer up to that day had used. So all of a sudden, the world was going to change to RAMs. Silicon was going to be our memory.

My whole life was basically trying to optimize things. You don’t just save parts, but every time you save parts you save on complexity and reliability, the amount of time it takes to understand something. And how good you can build it without errors and bugs and flaws.

I had no money. I could never build one. Chips back then were . . . like I said, to buy a computer built, it was like a down payment on a good house. So, because I could never build one, all I could do was design them on paper and try to get better and better and better. I was competing with myself. But that’s just the story of how my skill got so good. It’s because I could never build anything, I just competed with myself to come up with ideas that nobody else would come up with.

I knew that I had a lot of approaches in computers that basically no human really would use. They couldn’t even be taught in a school program. I did a lot of it in my head. Taught myself everything. We didn’t have computers in our high school even. And I was designing them.

My skill was that, if I know what I want for the end result—in those days it was a computer, in later days it might be a certain floppy disk that had to read and write some data—but if I knew what my end goal was, I know how to com- bine chips together very efficiently to get that goal done. Even if I’ve never designed anything before. My skills weren’t that I knew how to design a floppy disk, I knew how to design a printer interface, I knew how to design a modem interface; it was that, when the time came and I had to get one done, I would design my own, fresh, without knowing how other people do it.

All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a) not having money, and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every single thing that we came out with that was really great, I’d never once done that thing in my life.

 We had a guy that designed the Macintosh and he was the same way. He’d never gone to college, but, boy, he just studied circuits that had been done by others and just became that good on his own.

 I didn’t learn anything about designing computers in college.  I didn’t know anything about computer lan- guages except—a friend of mine had gone to MIT and, while he was there, he would Xerox pages out of books that were good topics, and he had sent me a lot of pages back from compiler design books. So I had actually read some com- piler design books. I hadn’t taken a course, I hadn’t had a teacher, but I had some ideas of some of the parts involved in parsing a computer language.

I  knew that I wanted a good enough computer and it meant a microproces- sor (once I discovered that a microprocessor was like those minicomputers I used to design), dynamic RAM was the choice to save money and parts, and I already had the terminal. Then I sniffed the wind and I said, “I need a lan- guage. I’ve got a 4K computer. It can run a language, but there’s no language yet for this microprocessor. So I was (a) a little bit disappointed because I wanted a computer language, but (b) I was excited and exuberant because I got to be the one to write the first language for this processor. I would get a little bit of fame out of that, and I was super shy, so the only way I could ever get noticed was if I designed great things.

In my minimalist approach, I made the wires the shortest, straightest, thinnest wires possible, instead of having these big old looped-up hairy messes of wire-wrap type stuff. So I did all that and I was also the technician. 

Steve Jobs came in saying, “Let’s start a company.” He said, “Look, there are a lot of people that want to build it and they can get the chips, but they don’t want to solder it all together. So why don’t we make a PC board and they can plop their chips in the PC board”—soldering a printed circuit board is easy, there are no wires—“and then they’ve got it done.”

So the idea was that we’d start this company and build PC boards for $20 and sell them for $40. Well, I only knew the club as a place to sell it and I thought, “Are there 50 people at the club”—I had a group gathering around me—“who are going to buy this computer instead of the Intel?” I didn’t think so, but Steve said, “Even if we don’t get our money back, at least we’ll have a company.” So it was like two good friends having a company.

How did you know Steve? That computer that was like the Altair that I’d built 5 years before— Cream Soda Computer—I’d told a friend down the block, Bill Fernandez, about it, and we agreed to solder it up in his garage. We spent about 2 weeks soldering my design together. We’d ride our bikes down to buy cream soda and come back and drink it, so we called it the Cream Soda Computer. Bill went to our high school, and he said, “There’s another guy at Homestead High School, younger than you, and he’s interested in electronics and pranks and things too and you really should meet him.” So he thought we were alike.

We both had a lot of similar experiences so we had a lot to talk about. Then we became best friends for so long. There weren’t that many people that young that knew technology. Steve and I weren’t similar personalities, which was strange, but I’m the sort of person that goes along with anyone that wants to talk technology.

The very first thought in my mind was, “I think I signed a document that everything I design belongs to Hewlett-Packard.” Even just on my own time, I thought that they deserved it first. And I wanted Hewlett-Packard to build this. I loved my division. I was going to work there for life. It was the cal- culator division; it was the right division to move into this kind of a computer.

When Steve called me one day at work and he said he got an order for $50,000—100 built computer boards for $500 each—that was high money. Now it was almost like we were big-time. We were going to sell some com- puters. Sure, we only sold 150 (maybe less) of the Apple Is, but it was a real computer and we had our name in all the magazines with charts and compar- isons. This whole industry’s springing up and there are articles about it. And no article could skip a company with a name like Apple.

Man, when I actually finally put together this little circuit and put some data into memory that should show up as color and it showed up color, it was just one of those eureka moments and you’re just shaking inside. It was just unbe- lievable. Here we had it in just a couple of chips. I had color, and then I had graphics, and then I had hi-res, and then I had paddles and sound to put games into the machine. It had dynamic memory—it had the newest right type of dynamic memory that could expand almost forever. All sorts of slots with a little mini–operating system that actually worked incredibly well. The Apple II was just one of those designs. Anybody could build things to add on to it, anybody could write programs, they could write sophisticated programs, they could write it in machine language, they could write it in my Basic. So that machine, there was just nothing stopping it.

We knew we’d sell 1,000 a month, but we couldn’t afford to build them. So we sought money, and one of the first places we went to was Commodore. To the guy who had been the product marketing manager for the 6502 micro- processor that I had chosen. That’s how we bought our first microprocessors that became the Apple I and Apple II, from this guy Chuck Peddle. He now was moving to Commodore to do a computer. We said, “We’ve got to show him the Apple II.” So we brought him by the garage. I really respected the guy; he designed the microprocessor that I had chosen. He came to the garage and looked at the Apple II, and I put it through all its specs of bringing up quick patterns on the screen and scrolling text and playing games—all the things I’d done on it. He looked at it and didn’t say too much. I figured he’d be more impressed. We later heard that Commodore turned it down.

Andre Sousan very soon after (within weeks) left Commodore and came to Apple saying that he felt we had the right product and he wanted to be with us. They just missed the boat. I think it was that Chuck Peddle knew what he could design, but he knew that he couldn’t design what the Apple II was. They should have bought it. They would have had a real good deal cheap. After that, we were still seeking money. I wasn’t really seeking the money, Steve Jobs was. I mean, I almost couldn’t have cared less. If I could show it off at the club and get credit for having a great computer design in my life, that’s what I wanted. 

Well, actually we never did much in the garage. People think we had a garage where we sat down with soldering irons and we designed stuff. No. The only designs that ever took place in the Apple I or II for hardware or soft- ware were in my apartment in Cupertino or my cubicle at Hewlett-Packard late at night. That’s the only place any building got done.

Mike was going to finance us, and then one day he said to me, “You have to leave Hewlett-Packard.” And I said, “Why? I designed two computers and cassette tape interfaces and printer interfaces and serial ports and I wrote a Basic and all this application software, I wrote demos, and I did all this moon- lighting, all in a year.”

I wanted to design computers and show them off and make software. And I can do that on my own time. I don’t need a company to do it. So there was an ultimatum day—I had to decide by a certain day if I was willing to do this. I met Mike and Steve at Mike’s cabaña at his house in Cupertino. Eventually we got around to it, and I said, “I’ve decided not to do it, here are my reasons.” Mike just said, “OK.” Steve was a little more upset.

That day my friend Allen Baum called me in the afternoon, and he said, “Look, you can start Apple and go into management and get rich, or you can start Apple and stay an engineer and get rich.” As soon as he said it was OK to do engineering, that really freed me up. My psychological block was really that I didn’t want to start a company. Because I was just afraid. In business and politics, I wasn’t going to be a real strong participant. I wasn’t going to tell other people how to do things. I wasn’t going to run things ever in my life. I was a non-political person and I was a very non-forceful person. It dated back to a lot of things that happened during the Vietnam War. But I just couldn’t run a company.

But then one person said I could be an engineer. That was all I needed to know, that “OK, I’ll start this company and I’ll just be an engineer.” To this day, I’m still on the org chart, on the bottom of the org chart—never once been any- thing but an engineer who works.

What about Ron Wayne? Steve knew Ron at Atari and liked him. Ron was a super-conservative guy. teve had 45 percent of this partnership, I had 45 percent, and Ron had 10 percent, because both of us agreed that we could trust him to resolve any dispute, and we would trust his judgment.

Do you remember any disagreements you had in the early days? Extremely minor. There were a couple, maybe. One was that we’re getting close to shipping it and we wanted things to be low-cost. Steve says, “Can we save any chips?” He’s pressing me and pressing me. I am down to like what is just amazing in the world. People to this day that understand circuitry tell me how they looked at my design and it was the most beautiful thing they ever saw. So I said, “I could cut out two chips if I skipped high-res. I don’t know if anybody’s really going to use high-res.” (It became very important actually.) And Steve said, “Oh no, if it’s only two chips, leave it in.”

When you showed people the Apple computer, were they amazed? Every single time I showed the Apple II, before we started the com- pany and even slightly after we started the company—before there was much word around about it, every single person who ever saw it . . . The engineers at Hewlett-Packard came to me and said, “That’s the best product I’ve ever seen.” And they’re around one of the greatest products of all time—the Hewlett- Packard calculator—and one of the greatest companies, and they’re saying things like that.

What is the key to excellence for an engineer? ou have to be very diligent. You have to check every little detail. You have to be so careful that you haven’t left something out. You have to think harder and deeper than you normally would. It’s hard with today’s large, huge programs. I was partly hardware and partly software, but, I’ll tell you, I wrote an awful lot of software by hand (I still have the copies that are handwritten), and all of that went into the Apple II. Every byte that went into the Apple II, it had so many different mathematical routines, graphics routines, computer languages, emulators of other machines, ways to slip your code in and out of an emulation mode. It had all these kinds of things and not one bug ever found. Not one bug in the hardware, not one bug in the software. And you just can’t find a product like that nowadays. But, you see, I had it so intense in my head, and the reason for that was largely because it was part of me. Everything in there had to be so important to me. This computer was me. And everything had to be as perfect as could be made. And I had a lot going against me because I didn’t have a com- puter to compile my code, my software.

Did you have a hard time getting everyday people to say, “Yeah, I want a computer in my office, my home”? lmost everyone who saw it wanted one, but usually the idea was, “What’s the cost?” A couple thousand bucks. “Well, I want one of those.”

Any other eureka moments in the early days? I’ve told you two major eureka moments. One was getting color to work, with this weird scheme that I had no idea if it’s going to work or not. The other was that I didn’t know if I was going to get Basic to program an arcade game, and it worked. In both those cases, I didn’t even know if it was possible and lucked out. The floppy disk was probably the third real major eureka story.
