## The Joy of Small

#### The Bootstrapper’s Manifesto

> I am a bootstrapper. I have initiative and insight and guts, but not much money. I will succeed because my efforts and my focus will defeat bigger and better-funded competitors. I am fearless. I keep my focus on growing the business—not on politics, career advancement, or other wasteful distractions.

> I will leverage my skills to become the key to every department of my company, yet realize that hiring experts can be the secret to my success. I will be a fervent and intelligent user of technology, to conserve my two most precious assets: time and money.

> My secret weapon is knowing how to cut through bureaucracy. My size makes me faster and more nimble than any company could ever be.

> I am a laser beam. Opportunities will try to cloud my focus, but I will not waver from my stated goal and plan—until I change it. And I know that plans were made to be changed.

> I’m in it for the long haul. Building a business that will last separates me from the opportunist, and is an investment in my brand and my future. Surviving is succeeding, and each day that goes by makes it easier still for me to reach my goals.

> I pledge to know more about my field than anyone else. I will read and learn and teach. My greatest asset is the value I can add to my clients through my efforts.

> I realize that treating people well on the way up will make it nicer for me on the way back down. I will be scrupulously honest and overt in my dealings, and won’t use my position as a fearless bootstrapper to gain unfair advantage. My reputation will follow me wherever I go, and I will invest in it daily and protect it fiercely.

> I am the underdog. I realize that others are rooting for me to succeed, and I will gratefully accept their help when offered. I also understand the power of favors, and will offer them and grant them whenever I can.

> I have less to lose than most -- a fact I can turn into a significant competitive advantage.

> I am a salesperson. Sooner or later, my income will depend on sales, and those sales can be made only by me, not by an emissary, not by a rep. I will sell by helping others get what they want, by identifying needs and filling them.

> I am a guerrilla. I will be persistent, consistent, and willing to invest in the marketing of myself and my business.

> I will measure what I do, and won’t lie about it to myself or my spouse. I will set strict financial goals and honestly evaluate my performance. I’ll set limits on time and money and won’t exceed either.

> Most of all, I’ll remember that the journey is the reward. I will learn and grow and enjoy every single day.

#### Leverage Points of Big Companies
- __Distribution.__ Never start by selling your product in major stores, use mail order. Or sell directly to just a few cx for lots of money per sale. Last step is traditional distribution.
- __Access to Capital.__ Be chaep in everything.
- __Brand Equity.__ Position against brand leader. "Cheaper than Levi's." The story should be short, solid, and memorable.
- __Customer Relationships.__
- __Great Employees.__

#### What the Big Guys Don't Have
- __Nothing to Lose.__ They have employees with a huge stake in maintaining the status quo.
- __Happy With Small Fish.__ Find a niche, not a nation.
- __Presidential Input.__ In big companies, the president is far removed from the action.
- __Rapid R&D.__ Big companies will almost always try to reduce invention risk by assigning a bureaucracy. You, on the other hand, can do it yourself.
- __The Underdog.__ 
- __Low Overhead.__
- __Time.__ 

A lot of this manifesto is about survival. A true bootstrapper worries about survival all the time. Why? Because if you fail, itʼs back to company cubicles, to work you do for someone else until you can get enough scratched together to try again.

## A Great Idea Can Wipe You Out

In a free society, the government doesnʼt control who gets the right to start a business. Anyone can do it—in most cases without a license, a permit, or a training course. This has one chilling implication: as soon as a business starts to make money, other people will notice, and theyʼll start a business just like it.

#### Business Model Elements
- Distribution
- Sales
- Pricing
- Production
- Raw Materials
- Positioning
- Marketing
- Barrier to Entry
- Scalability

#### BMs should be:
- __Profitable.__ Write down a target date to profitabiity.
- __Protectible.__
- __Self-priming.__ Stuff you buy needs to pay for its own growth.
- __Adjustible.__ Do whatever when the business scales up.
- __Optional exit strategy.__ 

__Do You Want to Be a Freelancer or an Entrepreneur?__

A freelancer sells her talents. While she may have a few employees, basically sheʼs doing a job without a boss, not running a business. Layout artists, writers, consultants, film editors, landscapers, architects, translators, and musicians are all freelancers. There is no exit strategy. There is no huge pot of gold. Just the pleasure and satisfaction of making your own hours and being your own boss.

An entrepreneur is trying to build something bigger than herself. She takes calculated risks and focuses on growth. An entrepreneur is willing to receive little pay, work long hours, and take on great risk in exchange for the freedom to make something big, something that has real market value.

The entrepreneur is comfortable raising money, hiring and firing, renting more office space than she needs right now. The entrepreneur must dream big and persuade others to share her dream. The freelancer, on the other hand, can focus on craft. She can most easily build her business by doing great work, consistently.

__The most successful bootstrappers donʼt invent a business model. They trade on the success of a proven one.__

## Follow the Money

1. Whoʼs going to buy your product or service (called product for brevity from here on in)?
2. How much are they going to pay for it?
3. Where will they find it?
4. Whatʼs the cost of making one sale?
5. What does it cost to make, package, ship, and inventory the item you just sold?
6. What’s your profit on one sale?
7. How many sales can you make a month?

If youʼre selling a custom service or a high-priced good, consider selling it directly. That cuts out lots of middlemen, and leaves it in your hands. If you can make this self-priming, youʼve gone a long way toward making your company successful.

In most products, the single largest step in the value chain is the last one—those four items in that list. If you and your company handle that last step, youʼve earned the right to the profit that comes with it.

Consumer products are almost impossible to bootstrap. Especially consumer products that need to be sold in thousands of drugstores in order to be profitable. Take a look at your local CVS—the number of bootstrapped products there is small indeed.

Successful bootstrappers know this: Your business is about the process. Itʼs not about the product. If you structure a business model that doesnʼt reward you as you proceed, it doesnʼt matter how much you love the product. Pretty soon there wonʼt be any product to love.

The bootstrapper is focused on finding a market that will sustain the process. A platform that responds to the work you do. With a business model that works, the deal is simple. You invest time, effort, and money. In return, your market responds with sales, cash flow, and profits.

You can pick any business in the universe to bootstrap. I recommend picking one thatʼs friendly to bootstrappers, that wants you to succeed, that will likely give back what you put in. Itʼs easier to tell you what to avoid than to point you in the right direction. Businesses that are also hobbies usually cause bootstrappers the most trouble: restaurants, toy design and invention, creating gourmet foods.

On the other hand, mail order, consulting, acting as a sales rep or other sort of middleman, all work great. So does focusing like a laser on a very obscure market that is growing fast.

#### How to Bootstrap a Business the Smart Way

She had made a mistake. She built a business without a business model. She tried to invent a process that could turn into a living, to become a freelancer with a royalty stream in an industry where there were very, very few role models. She could still design her clothes and bags as a hobby, but she knew it wouldnʼt give her enough income to make a living. She had to find another way.

Did she succeed because the her calendar idea was the most unique, original idea in the his- tory of publishing? Or because she was a skilled novelist? Not at all. She succeeded because she understood what her market wanted and because she persevered for years and years to build her reputation. She was careful with expenses, didnʼt waste her equity, and set herself up for success while protecting against failure.

As Lynnʼs story illustrates, when youʼre in the right place at the right time with the right product, you can make it work.

Most people hate to be wrong. They hate to make a statement (or, even worse, to write something down) and then be proved wrong. They donʼt like to buy the wrong car, vote for the wrong candidate, wear the wrong shoes.

Starting a business is the most public, most expensive, riskiest way of all to be wrong.

__Hereʼs my best advice to you: Stop planning and start doing.__

You donʼt have to quit your day job. But you do have to get out there and do it. The more you do, the more you do. Doors will open. Opportunities will appear. Your model will change, your reputation will increase, you will become a magnet for smart people, good customers, and investors. But none of this will happen if you stay inside and keep planning.

## Doing the Math
 
Money is a tool, not an end in itself for most bootstrappers. If you wanted to make big money with little risk, youʼd go to Wall Street or get a fancy job for a conglomerate.

Be a superrealist when it comes time to do revenue projections. In fact, be a pessimist.

One surefire way to determine if a bootstrapper is going to succeed or not is to check out how she changes her lifestyle when she starts the business. If everything is first-class—the office, the car, the mortgage, the vacations—then my bet is that the entrepreneur is too focused on taking from the business and not nearly focused enough on building it.

Are you willing to move? To sell your car and buy a junker? To cut major personal expenses so you have more to invest in your business? These are critical decisions, and you need to make them with your family before you run out of money. Because adjusting your expense cycle then is way too late.

The time to develop a multiple income source strategy is not when you run out of money. Then it will be too late.

While Iʼm a huge fan of the multiple income source strategy, thereʼs an important caveat: Donʼt let the sideline take over (unless you want it to). Itʼs so easy to get focused on the short term, on the “now,” that you ignore the reason you started the business in the first place.

#### If You Have Sales, You Have (Almost) Everything

A business with plenty of sales can almost always get funding. A company with plenty of sales can almost always fix its other problems. But a company without sales is close to dead.

Sooner or later, your business comes down to extracting cash from other people or busi- nesses and keeping as much of it as you can. Itʼs tempting to focus on your product, your systems, your policies, the writing on page 7 of your brochure. But none of those matter if you donʼt have sales.


__Sell Something That People Want to Buy (And Know How to Buy!).__

Figuring out what people want to buy is a two-step process. The first step is figuring out what theyʼre already buying. The second step is getting people to switch.

Usually, you need to make a product that is significantly easier or more effective. Easier to buy. Easier to use. Easier to teach other people how to use. More effective at solving the problem.

It didnʼt take long for the ball-point pen to replace the fountain pen, did it? All you had to do was use it once to see how much more convenient it was.

It took only 10 years for the word processor to completely wipe out the billion-dollar type- writer industry. Even though a word processor costs 5 to 50 times as much as typewriter, the ease was far greater.

__Own the Sales Process__

“If a man builds a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to his door.”

Pick an industry—any industry. What you’ll discover is that the people with power are those who either do the buying or make lots of sales.

Follow the money! The money leads to power—the power to make decisions, the power to build the business you want to build, the power to hire and fire and shape and dream and succeed.

For too many bootstrappers, sales is an afterthought. Itʼs the thing you do that allows you to do what you really want to do. Big mistake. In fact, sales is the reason for your business to exist. If you canʼt sell what you make, you canʼt help anyone, influence anyone, or make anyoneʼs life easier, better, or more convenient. If you canʼt sell what you make, you canʼt pay yourself. Youʼre finished.

Many bootstrappers are tempted to delegate the sales process to a representative, an agent, or an employee. Big mistake. The sales process—regardless of your business—is the heart of your business. As long as you control it, you control your company. Without it, you are at the mercy of whomever you delegate it to.

Once you have a cash flow from sales, youʼll be amazed at how easy it is to buy everything else you need. As a buyer, you have all the power. You can pit suppliers against each other in bidding wars to get you the lowest price. You can find spectacular freelancers who will build, assemble, design, draw—whatever you need done, you can buy.

What should you do if you hate to sell? What if the idea of getting in front of a customer fills you with dread? Basically, you have two choices: You can find another line of work. Or you can focus all of your energy on hiring someone who can sell better than you can.

Faking your way through isnʼt going to work. Hoping that the sales process will go away wonʼt help either. As a bootstrapper you must sell yourself and your business. Otherwise, no business.

__Rule 1: Find People Who Care About Cash Less Than You Do__

Borrowing from other businesses to fund your business is much smarter than borrowing personal money. Your suppliers and your customers almost certainly have different objectives than you. If you can collect early and pay late, you can grow with their money.

Courting your big suppliers is a big part of being a successful bootstrapper. It gives you leverage.

Another very important step in establishing credit: Be up-front with your customers and learn how to deal with them in a professional way. One thing the credit department of your target company will want is a credit history. So build one as quickly as you can.

In 1985, I cold-called Beth Emme, a printing salesperson for R. R. Donnelly, the largest print- er in the world. (I figured I ought to start at the top.) I persuaded her to buy me lunch (always let the salespeople pay!) and then quizzed her for two hours. What she taught me about printing would have taken years to learn without her help.

__Rule 2: Survival Is Success__

At the beginning, when youʼre armed with a plan and a cash-flow statement, you might be tempted to be very choosy about which projects and which customers you take. Donʼt do that! (At least not too much). Watch the money. Take the money.

Allocate a percentage of your week to making money. Any way you can that doesnʼt distract from the core business. If a project makes money, itʼs a good project. If a product makes money, itʼs a good product.

__Rule 3: Success Leads to More Success__

The more you do, the more you do. Being in front of people will lead to new opportunities, new products, new engagements. Be in motion, because customers like motion.

Iʼve worked with many bootstrappers who have turned focus into a double-edged sword. They turn down work or avoid pursuing opportunities because they worry that it will keep them off the market when the right thing comes along.

Being busy creates its own successes. How?

1. Gives you positive cash flow
2. Teaches you things you didnʼt know
3. Builds your reputation
4. Builds your credit rating
5. Puts you in contact with smart people and potential customers

__Rule 4: Redo the Mission Statement and the Business Plan Every Three Months__

Your path to business success is a maze, not a straight line. As the market develops, as you develop, as your employees develop, youʼll discover you made some great decisions. But you also probably made some short-term decisions that became habits, and missed some oppor- tunities because you were busy chasing something else.

__Rule 5: Associate With Winners__

Some customers are demanding, focused, responsive bellwethers for the market. After creat- ing something for these customers, youʼll discover lots of other customers wanting to buy something just like that.

Youʼll discover that the time you spend managing people can have a huge impact on the way you run your business. And the boldness and cleverness of your employees will directly impact the decisions you make.

If youʼre hellbent on building a multi million-dollar corporation, better be sure your employ- ees buy into that before you hire them. And if you need an in-house skeptic to balance your proclivity to launch hare brained schemes, make sure you hire for that as well.

The two most important things you can do when hiring people are:

- Make sure you have a precise, written description of both what the person is to ac- complish and the attitudes and behaviors you want to see.
- Hire people quickly, but hire everyone with a 60-day trial period. If a person isnʼt adding enough value to your company, swallow the pain and ask him to leave. By doing that, youʼll feel far less pain than you would in the long run by keeping that person.

Finding peers is difficult. Most bootstrappers and senior-level executives believe that they are too busy to take the time to interact when there isnʼt a specific business reason.

The best way to find peers is to devote several hours a week to doing favors for people. Favors with no intent of being repaid. Do some favors for strangers and some for friends.

A few hours a week ought to net you a group of 100 or more peers who will benefit from your efforts as much as youʼll benefit from theirs.

A warning about the organized groups: Be sure to join one thatʼs as upbeat and enabling as you are. It does you no good to sit around complaining about employees and banks and cus- tomers. You need to surround yourself with people who have succeeded and are still enjoying the ride.

__Rule 6: Beware of Shared Ownership__

A 50/50 split is almost never fair...Inevitably, someone feels cheated. And someone goes for the ride.

Remember, the number one thing you have to invest is your time. And itʼs almost impossible to guarantee that a partner is going to invest her time in the same way or with the same impact as you. At the early stages of starting your business, itʼs tempting to undervalue the company, to let the experts have a big piece of the pie in exchange for getting you in the door.

__Rule 7: Advertise__

From the first day, allocate a percentage of your income to marketing. Do marketing before you take out money to pay yourself. Letters, phone calls, banner ads, space ads, even TV. They’re all cheaper than you think, and you’ve got to spend the money to get the money back.

Advertising feels like an expense. Itʼs not. Itʼs an investment. An investment that takes a little while to pay off, but when it does, itʼs magic.

#### THE FOUR MOST IMPORTANT RULES OF ADVERTISING

SPEND REGULARLY ON ADVERTISING. The way to plan your advertising is to budget for it. Figure out approximately how much your competitors advertise. (This is easy if theyʼre buying print ads, much harder if theyʼre using direct mail. One way to get an idea is to ask someone who doesnʼt directly compete with you what they do.) Then, settle on a percentage of your revenue that will at least, match, if not beat, the industry average.

PERSISTENCE IS THE SECRET TO SUCCESS. In my town, a guy named Steve buys an ad every week in the local paper. Steve fixes toilets. I donʼt have a broken toilet right now, but you can bet that when I do, Iʼll dig out last weekʼs paper and call Steve. Steve earned the sale. He bought it with a great, consistent advertise- ment. I trust Steve. I figure if he can afford to keep running that ad, he must be pretty good at fixing toilets.

If you persist, directing your advertising to the same people over and over and over again, youʼll make a dent. Instead of always looking for a new prospect, a new audience, a new market, make sure you harvest all the apples on this tree first.

Marketers focus on two different things: reach and frequency. Reach is a measurement of how many different people see your ad. Frequency is a measurement of how often these people see your ad.

BE CLEAR. 

TEST AND MEASURE. The more you measure, the better your ad gets. Be a control freak about testing. Test one thing at a time. Make every ad you run a direct-response ad. Even if youʼre trying to boost your storeʼs traffic, build in a response mechanism.

Most of all, you should ask. No business is so impersonal that you canʼt talk to your custom- ers. Take them to lunch or buy them coffee or just chat with them. Ask them what theyʼve noticed about your marketing campaign. Ask them what finally enticed them to come visit.

GET MENTORED. To find a mentor, you need to take some initiative. Finding the right person in the right in- dustry at the right stage of her career takes some homework. If you feel as though youʼre alone out there, go get some help. Not everyone will say yes (most of us are way too busy to mentor everyone weʼd like to). But if you can find the right people, odds are some of them will be happy to assist you.

RULE 9: OBSERVE THOSE LITTLE BIRDS THAT CLEAN THE TEETH OF VERY BIG HIPPOS

Find bigger, richer, more stable organizations. Partner with them. It gives you credibility and access and sometimes, cash flow.

Most big-company founders hate what their companies have become. They rail against the slowness, the bureaucracy, the inability to get anything done anymore. What they need is someone like you. Someone who can take on a specific task and turn company assets into gold.
