Chapter One -- Establishing Goals and Expectations
==================================================

Financial Needs
---------------
* Reduce Monthly Expenses
* Establish a Fund for the Year, figure out your monthly living expenses to figure out your needs.

10 Traits
---------

	* Humor and perspective. You shouldn't be as high as the last victory or as low as the last defeat. Humor is also a sign of high intelligence and mental agility.
	* Influence. You have to be able to speak in such a way that you can command a room or persuade an individual.
	* Confidence and self-esteem.
	* Fearlessness. Walk away from the business you don't want and the buyers you don't like.
	* Rapid framing. You can quickly summarize the issues and articulate what the client wants.
	* Value generation. You are able to create real value for the client.
	* Intellectual firepower. Powerful people tend to hire powerful people, and powerful people are the ones with large sums to invest.
	* Active listening. Demonstrate that you are able to listen to the other people correctly, and that you understand what they are saying.
	* Instantiation. You are able to make abstract examples and concepts tangible.
	* Bang-bang responsiveness. GET BACK TO CX AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

Time Use

	* Create lists and folders of what to do, paper lists are usually better than computer ones.
	* Find advisors whom you trust, for stuff like accounting, paying yourself a salary, how to get clients, how to position the biz…
	* Find a mentor who will teach you what to do and who has been in your place before.
	* Find specialists who know how you can incorporate a company or how to structure the finances and payroll.

Time Investment Tips

	* Integrate your professional life and your personal life.
	* Use lists to create forward progress (daily, weekly, and monthly todo list).
	* Don't do things which you aren't skilled in. Hire a graphic designer to do your letterhead and logo. Hire a lawyer to incorporate, an accountant to do your taxes.
	* Don't dally over low-priority decisions. Think of things which can be change immediately after anyway.
	* Do what feels right at the time.
	* Maintain a sanctum sanctorum. You have to have a designated workplace as a private office. This has to have all your equipment and have minimum distractions.
	* Be selfish with personal time, tell people you are busy anyway. Schedule repairs and maintenance around your convenience, not the vendors.
	* Plan your long-term investment.
	* GO WHEN YOU ARE 80% READY

Why do some people obtain biz faster?

	* Larger contact base.
	* Business from a former employer.
	* Bolder in pursuing networking and leads.
	* Higher confidence and self-esteem.
	* Luck and serendipity.
	* Fater with publicity, web presence, promotion.
	* IF YOU CANNOT ACQUIRE BUSINESS WITHIN A YEAR, EXIT.

You have to see your bookkeeper, accountant, and attorney in the eye. You also have to be near your printer.

If they ask you why you are alone, tell them that the biggest organisations in the world hire independent consultants because they are highly focused and cost-effective.

Chapter Two -- Physical Space
=============================

Office at Home

	* Enclosed, private area with a door.
	* Sufficient space for a computer, a printer, a phone, a postage meter, and a desk.
	* Phone line
	* Air conditioning
	* Enough storage for frequently needed files, support materials, and supplies
	* Natural lighting from outdoors
	* Large, spacious desk and chair
	* You can charge rent to yourself
	* As big a monitor as you can
	* A laser printer with the fastest printing you can afford.

Keys

	* Let go of what you already know. Your professional arrogance might kill you.
	* Find people smarter than you. Success is not accident and most leave clues. Find a mentor who will tell it to you like it is, won't do it for you but can give solid advice.
	* Own your value or stay employed. You are an expert. Your expertise enhances the quality of human life, by giving people access to information they didn't have before.

Chapter Three
=============

Chapter Four -- Marketing 101
=============================

Marketing: The act of creating and accentuating need among potential buyers of your services. The difference between what they want and what they need is your added value as a consultant.

Spokes

	* Press kit : Flyers/presentation folder of your portfolio.
	* Stationary and related image products: Letterhead, matching second sheets, envelopes, labels, business cards
	* Networking: Testimonials, references.
	* Pro bono work.
	* Listing, ads, and other passive sources.

Business cards are not for marketing, they are for people to contact you. Name, title, organisation, phone, fax.

Networking: You want to provide value to others so they will be moved to reciprocate. Networking is a process and not an event: it takes weeks to properly develop a networking relationship.

Pro Bono Work

	* You are legitimately contributing to a worthy cause.
	* You are honing your skills in an appreciative environment.
	* Potential buyers are seeing you in the best possible light.
	* Don't make sales pitches, attempt to create good relationships.

Electronic consulting: Make relationships, no corporate buyer looks for services over the Internet. Better to try to get articles and columns published in online publications to enhance the reach of your expertise and differentiate you.

The marketing business is embarrassing: you have to sell yourself (you have to sell you to yourself first).

Chapter Five -- Advanced Marketing: Creating a Brand
====================================================

Web site

* A web site is a credibility site, not a sales site. Execs might get to your site after they meet or hear from you, and they should know that you know your stuff.
* You want to have an enduring connection.
* You want to increase credibility of yourself.
* Personal contact number.

What they look for in a web designer

* Get references about the designer's reliability.
* Establisj costs clearly, both for setup, ongoing charges, and yearly fees.
* Make sure the chemistry is right.
* Agree to a test site before going live.
* Figure out who secures the domains, you or them.

Trade Show Presentations

* Begin with a hook (story, statistic, illustration, humour).
* Middle of the speech: "I have x points".
* The end should be a brief summary and call to action.
* Use a professional introduction and ask the introducer to read it verbatim.
* Practice in the room before you speak.
* Use visuals that can be seen.
* Tape your presentations.

Notes

* A criminal will find you anyway, so don't be afraid to put your home address out there.
* You learn from books, so don't duel them.
* Writing a book: Have something to say.
* No, do not do podcasts on other sites.

Best Practices in Leverage

	* Use a signature file. "Alan Weiss, Ph. D. President, Summit Consulting Group, Inc. Box 1009 East Greenwich RI 02818 summitconsulting.com alan@summitconsulting .com
	* Align contacts in groups.
	* Spread testimonials around, if you can cycle the different testimonials, why not.
	* Use form macros if you can.
	* Press release
	* Create a professional voice mail response.
	* Promote the brand
	* Provide downloadable material
	* Maximize web presence (SEO will come later once you build up your brand).
	* Google Alerts to know where things come from.


Chapter Six -- Process and Acquiring Business
=============================================

	* Acquiring consulting clients is totally dependent on building solid relationships, not making sales.
	* Relationships are built with specific people, not with organisations or legal entities.
	* The best way to build relationships is by placing yourself in the buyer's shoes and thinking from the outside in.
	* The buyer doesn't care how good you are; the buyer only cares what's in it for the buyer, so finish on business outcomes.
	* Providing value early is the key to trust and engagement.

The Right Buyer

	⁃	You need to find the person who is likely to write a check for that value.
	⁃	It is self-defeating and futile to attempt to develop long-term relationships with noneconomic buyers, no matter how friendly, promising, or likeable they may be.
	⁃	This buyer is almost always never in the HR or training development.
	⁃	You need to find the person who will shake hands with you, and say "the paperwork can all follow in due course."
	⁃	Value-based marketing is simple and important.
	⁃	Ways of providing value: Focus groups, keynotes, workshops, seminars, executive summaries, etc.

What is the Value or Impact to the Organisation?

	⁃	What would be the impact or result if you did nothing at all?
	⁃	What would happen if this project failed?
	⁃	What does this mean to you, personally?
	⁃	What is the difference for the organisation/customers/employees?
	⁃	How will this affect performance and productivity?
	⁃	How will this affect profitability/market share/competitive advantage?
	⁃	What is this currently costing you annually, and what might you save or gain?
	⁃	What is the impact on return on investment/equity/sales/assets?

The cx progression: A series of Yeses

	⁃	Initial contact through lead or referral or chance. Yes desired: Hear some background, read some material, agree to second contact.
	⁃	Second contact, after material or information is exchanged. Yes desired: Agree to a brief meeting.
	⁃	Brief meeting. Yes desired: Form a relationship, agree on the second, substantive meeting.
	⁃	Second meeting. Yes desired: Conceptual agreement, willingness to entertain a proposal.
	⁃	Proposal. Yes desired: Acceptance.

Before establishing a fee
-------------------------

	⁃	Determine who the economic buyer is.
	⁃	Develop a trusting relationship.
	⁃	Establish outcome-based business objectives.
	⁃	Establish measures of success.
	⁃	Establish the value or impact for the organisation of the project.

Chapter Seven -- Proposals
==========================

Proposals should state the following:

	⁃	Stipulate the outcomes of the project.
	⁃	Describe how progress will be measured.
	⁃	Establish accountability.
	⁃	Set start and stop dates.
	⁃	Provide methodologies.
	⁃	Explain options available.
	⁃	Convey the value of the project.
	⁃	Detail the terms and conditions of the payment of fees and reimbursements.
	⁃	Serve as an ongoing template for the project.
	⁃	Establish boundaries to avoid scope creep.
	⁃	Protect both consultant and client.
	⁃	Offer reasonable guarantees and assurances.

Chapter Eight -- Establishing Fees
==================================

If you're going to invest the hard work, discipline, talent, and dedication, you might as well earn the money commensurate with your talents and results.

Two rules:

	⁃	Always work on a project fee or value-based fee, period.
	⁃	Always demonstrate to the client that this arrangement is in the client's best interest.

How to convince a buyer that value-based fees are best

	⁃	There is a cap on your investment, you know exactly what is to be spent and there are no surprises.
	⁃	There is never a meter running, you don't have to worry each time you ask for my help.
	⁃	It would be unfair to place you in the position of making an investment decision, whenever you want to know something you have to pay me for it.
	⁃	Same goes for your people, they should ask me anything when they want to.
	⁃	If I find additional, relevant work that was unanticipated but must be performed, I can do it without having to come to you for additional funds.
	⁃	If you find additional, related work that must be done, you can freely request it without worrying about increased costs.
	⁃	If conditions change in your organisation, then you don't have to ask me to finish the project with less time, and the quality approach is assured.
	⁃	If I need additional resources, there is no cost to you.
	⁃	This is really uncomplicated, there will never be a debate about what is billable time, and what should be done on site or off site.
	⁃	You can demonstrate to the board, the shareholders, or anyone else required that there is a fixed investment and that budget has been allocated, and an expected return to justify the budget.

Fifty-one Ways to Increase Your Fees:

	⁃	Establish the fee collaboratively with the client.
	⁃	Base fees on value, not tasks. Don't say how many FGD, observation, etc there will be.
	⁃	NEVER EVER USE TIME AS THE BASIS OF YOUR VALUE.
	⁃	Don't stop with what the client wants, but pursue what the client needs.
	⁃	Think of the fourth sale first: fees are cumulative, not situational.
	⁃	Engage the client in the diagnosis, talk with and listen to the client.
	⁃	NEVER VOLUNTARILY OFFER OPTIONS TO DECREASE FEES. Don't say, "well it's X, but I can do it for less if that's a problem."
	⁃	If you are forced to consider fee reduction, reduce the value commensurately: "What value should we take out?"
	⁃	Don't allow yourself to be cornered, turn around "how" and "how much" by appealing to the buyer's self interest ("I'll be able to explain that better once I've heard a few things from you."
	⁃	Provide options every time--the choice of yeses.
	⁃	Clients believe they get what they pay for.
	⁃	The choice becomes "how to use" as opposed to "whether to use".
	⁃	Pursue strategy top down: First, determine your strengths and your most valuable contributions, then formulate a value proposition that capitalises on those strengths. Then, follow your priorities of what publications to get published in, what conferences to speak at, and how to advertise your services on the Web.
	⁃	Do not cold call, and don't pursue lukewarm prospects. You are just wasting time there. Invest your time in developing intellectual property, building status as a thought leader in your discipline. High-level buyers do not want to be sold to; they want to share their thoughts with knowledgeable people.
	⁃	Master the value-based fee framework. Approach each prospect conversation with value creation toward the economic buyer. Keep your acquisition model in the back of your head.
	⁃	Avoid noneconomic buyers.
	⁃	Never stop developing your mastery of language.
	⁃	Always provide an option that is comprehensive and over any stated budget. Just give them options.
	⁃	Ensure that the client is aware of the full range of your services. Early in the conversation, acquaint the buyer with your abilities, not by citing a list of options, but by providing examples of how you have worked with othe clients.
	⁃	If a minor part of the proposed project is not within your competence, don't abandon it, subcontract it. 
	⁃	Always ask yourself, "why me, why now, why in this manner?". And answer it. This is not greedy, hotels charge more for the exact same room during the holidays.
	⁃	Determine how many options the buyer perceives: if you're the only option being considered, then you're valuable.
	⁃	If you must lower fees, gain a quid pro quo from the buyer. You might need to do so to get an entry into a potentially long-term client; you know that money is temporarily tight, or you might do it as a favour for someone in need.
	⁃	Do not accept troublesome, unpleasant, or suspicious businesses.
	⁃	Any highly compensated employee must bring in new business. The employee must be accountable for new business acquisition.
	⁃	It is better to do something pro bono than to do it for a lower fee.
	⁃	Fees have nothing to do with supply and demand, what matters is value.
	⁃	Psychologically, higher fees create higher value in buyers' perceptions.
	⁃	Value can include subjective as well as objective measures.
	⁃	Introduce new value in existing clients to raise fees within those accounts.
	⁃	Do not accept referral work on the same basis as the referral.
	⁃	At least two years, remove the bottom 15% of your business.
	⁃	Offer incentives to accelerate payments.
	⁃	Practice stating and explaining your fees.
	⁃	Always be prepared to walk away from business.
	⁃	Practice stating high fees.
	⁃	Remove fees from all printed materials. When asked about fees, reply, "I don't know."
	⁃	Respond to scope creep with "I'll send a new proposal."
	⁃	When you do something pro bono, send an invoice. Show the pro-bono client what your actual fee would have been, and then waive it.
	⁃	Stay very sensitive to margins, it's not what you make but what you keep that is crucial.
