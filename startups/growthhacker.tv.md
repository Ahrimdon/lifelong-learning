## GrowthHacker.tv: Code School

Envylabs was very active in promotion but all the coursers were on their original domain.

Validation: You can’t get time back.

Understand the behavior of each user: who subscribes, clickstream.

Users came from railsforzombies.org. Where can we get free content in that they have to sign up to get free content.

We didn’t have a vertical: when we put a path together, it’s increased the user’s lifetime value.

Give them a lot of handholding, share their futures.

Referral: Good user base. People tweet on twitter about sharing. We have this Hall Pass campaign: how do we incentivize someone to share something?

“Hey we want to give you two days on out platform.” When they sign up on e-mail, you want to share this to others.

So you wind up with a free trial, and you have to invest by sharing others. The kids are in multiple courses 

Lock-in factor: When someone is locked in, the two days is just far enough, but they won’t get far into the course.

“Man I really need to finish this.” The 2 days is a decent enough to attempt to get far, but short enough that you need to put a credit card in.

Reward is frictionless. “Hey it’s going to go away.” The share is just a button on the email.

Time sensitivity: Must share in 2 days or something.

Email: What are we trying to accomplish with this, what do we want our customers to learn? The welcome e-mail sends out features. The subscription welcome sends out features so the user can take advantage of all parts of the website.

As much as possible, we try to put things in MailChimp.

Users are segmented, so the emails are different and have different messages.

We use Mandrill.

We don’t want to over-email people.

The invoice email: Here’s what you did for this month. You got value for what you’re paying. If they don’t  do stuff, then just say “here’s what you could have done”. Then put the invoice.

Target market = developers, and some channels don’t work. Devs don’t look at ads. When you put resources in email, you make the money back.

Email is a very profitable channel. It has to be personal. Adding a smiley face on the subject line increased stuff. Even a small ASCII arrow on a tweet, it works.

How to capture emails? We offer a free course. Just the e-mail at first.

Onboarding: Focus on the pain points, and what we should do. There has to be some sort of story with the onboarding: “Hey, you’re doing so well with your code, check this feature out.”

“Let’s get people to understand that you learned these things.” Stories get shared in a way that other information doesn’t. If you can make things a story, then it’s a great psychology hack.

When someone is cancelling, we will call them a dropout because of the bad story about that.

If too fast to convert, that’s a problem. You have to time the discount not on Day 2, but you have to have this big gun later. We want to extract the right amount of revenue per customer.

Cross-targeting with other brands mean we are able to offer free stuff that aren’t even ours lol.

CodeSchool Local: We didn’t think about the logistics and it sucked. The meetups took a lot of time. When we send shirts internationally, we spend money on customs lol.

If you try and try shit, then something will work at some point.

Track what you fail so you don’t repeat it again.

What we want is to make the homepage dynamic based and the learning path dynamic.

Optimizely is awesome.

You need to take care of your engineer.

At the end of the day, a growth hacker is just a good marketer.

Referral campaigns: A lot of unknowns there.

Good UI: You always hit the right button, every time.

Analytics and measurement. You need to start narrowing in on your users.

## GrowthHacker.tv: Matt Ellsworth: VP Growth, Storefront

We want to make it easy to have offline stores. We take professional photos of the stores too.

At the start, it’s more of trusting the gut and rolling with it in the early-stage, you have to do things brute-force, especially when you’re a small team.

Early stage: BRUTE FORCE. Do not cherry-pick because you’re still working on the engine, not the chrome.

Growth, like product, is about iteration. Get something shitty out, but just iterate it.

Messaging: Important for internal selling and external selling. Here’s how we segment our users on both sides, and here’s how we get the value for each of them.

It’s rarely about technology, it’s usually about words. One of the oldest growth hacks is to just use the right words at the right time. You have to reference things that the customer knows (what words do they like, and what words do they use).

Pricing: In SaaS, just highball people. For a marketplace, it’s different. We just try to share best practices with the people. It’s hard to price this because it’s super early (short-term pricing). We can go “what is a year’s worth, just divide it and add premium for the short-term.”

The first number you speak is the “highest thing I go”. If you start high with a SaaS, you can give a discount.

You need a product slide and story arc for your product. It’s your place to explain to people to say “why do we exist as a company.” We investigate the case studies, which you then show to the customers so that everyone (even the non-client facing guys) gets to understand why the company exists and why they are there.

Often the cheapest videos are actually the best ones lol, it’s easy to hire someone in Youtube.

There was a time where Matt was just in meetings with brokers and landlords and whatever, while not scalable, it needed to have some content on there. Being in front of people and getting them to trust you personally is how you can establish credibility early on.

Now that you have real listings, you don’t need to do that anymore. You have to learn when to transition from face-to-face to automated (sales to marketing). When scaling up, the sales guys give way to marketing guys. The sales are usually the first ones to go lol.

People should be learning more skills so they protect themselves and they bring value to the company. It’s your responsibility to be employable. What are the assets I have, and what does the market look like? It’s all about value, provide value to the company.

For us, the supply side (stores) is harder to seed. It’s easier to get attention at brick-and-mortar than online when everyone is online. At first, they found us organically, but then when you put money in people’s pockets and they come back.

We don’t stop with the face to face, we’ll help you as much as we can, because we never want to stop cultivating those one-on-one relationship.

Paid is not so good channel, we want outbound and conversations with people.

If people don’t like your thing, then it’s okay. Actually you want people to hate you because if nobody hates you then you aren’t disruptive. As long as more people like you, then that’s okay.

When people fundamentally hate you, they might say some insights, but remember that they are a hater.

We make posters and shirts and it is something we spend on, but it is because we are an offline company.

MixRank data is legit but import.io, we need to learn how scrapers work.

## GrowthHacker.tv: Ash Maurya, Running Lean

The problem is that we just rush into the build cycle and eventually we run into the scaling problem.

I hate that feeling that when I spend a significant amount of time and it is for naught, then I feel bad.

So I build a landing page just to get e-mails and see if I have an early market. To each of the e-mails I get, I send an e-mail to them asking why they would actually use this product. They provide me with the value proposition.

Once I hit 1K users, that’s when I took this experiment more seriously. It took 2 ½ months.

If you practice ent, it just takes a lot of tenacity, it’s a TON OF HARD WORK.

Too many ents are focused with the solution, but remember that what you want is a working business model.  You want to document your plan A and break it into component pieces.

Nobody reads business plans, they start making up stuff, but it is a work of fiction at that point. The goal isn’t creating a perfect model or plan.

There’s more information in the BMC than a business plan Remember: It’s harder to make things short rather than long!!!!

Interviewing the customers: The purpose is to go out there and talk with the customers.

One is physically talking with the customers. Second is to test them, and understand that we have secured the right customer.

In a problem interview: gauge the problem and what they are currently doing to solve the problem. Ideally you want to filter the problems people have.

When you do lean principle, it almost as if it’s cheating because the customer supplies you with the information (lol).

Product launch: Have you built something that a customer actually wants now?

iPhone 1: It didn’t have some basic features such as cut/paste and multi-tasking, but they didn’t concentrate on those features anyway.

Pre-paying: We sort of want this.

MVP interview: When you have just 10-20 customers, trying to collect data is not significant, you have to do this face-to-face or over Skype type of person as possible. I need to have this notion of an MVP interview, we will help the customer get set up, and get a usability test in.

Even if it’s not exciting, you have to do this interview because it is the foundation.

Product-market fit: We can measure things like engagement and referral and see if you are actually hitting progress. This is with the number spikes, etc.

Don’t be a feature-pusher: just 3-5 people means you solve 80% of the problems. You discover the required features if you understand that “people buy iPhone because of this.” The next features are the pain points of your initial customers. What is lacking?

Usually we don’t keep feature logs because needed features will appear when they need it.

Pivot = NOT TRYING RANDOM STUFF.

Metrics: Baseline, cohort (not aggregate), have to know how to run experiments (split testing and A/B testing).

## GrowthHacker.tv: Dan McKinley, Etsy

Big data is used in Etsy to produce a recommender system and for search ranking.

All client-facing engineeers do experiments.

Checkout: You don’t want to see the ratio of who did, you want to see the value of the transactions.

The seller back-end has more engagement than the buyers.

There are some features that have never been used before. “Our first stab at everything is not working out.”

Experimentcalculator.com: Way of figuring sample size.

AB Testing: Nearly everything fails lol. Ex: bidding for stores to make things, that sucked.

Etsy doesn’t release a lot of lines of codes at once, it’s more of 100 lines/day, 30 times.

Infinite scroll: Premise was search was easier to use. We can’t find a way to do this without making things worse. What we did was we increased/decreased search times by 200ms. It didn’t matter so much.

Removing the search dropdown: Initially this was for handmade/vintage, but it got out of hand. To remove the thing, we had to:

Redesign marketplace, default to “all items”, rich autosuggest, suggest shops in items, add favorites filter, search bars on item, and kill the dropdown.

Each step is reversible, and the releases were small.

First: Add to left side of search.

Second: Add to the autosuggest a facet. This increased sales of vintage.

It turns out that casual users of the site didn’t know anything about this feature (dropdown).

The same with shops, we realzie that shops added to item results wouldn’t work.

Experiment with minimal versions of your idea, plan on being wrong (don’t be surprised if you’re wrong a lot).

__Users hate opening things up in new tabs (unlike developers).__

Infinite scroll, users bought less from searching.

Figuring out parts that don’t work: is it because it sucks, or because it doesn’t work.

Real-time data: good for operational stuff. If you want to test things, wait for a few days.
 
## GrowthHacker.tv: Tracy Chou, Engineer Pinterest

Good answer: Focus on the benefit, not the features! Don't make answers to "what is x" to be an engineering answer.

To make something: Technically we want shit but we want to know what is useful to the people: asking companies to pin shit, making rich pins actionable, making discoverable content.

Product first before technical, at first things looky hacky, but at least we can iterate from there. When you onboard new engineers, that's when you invest on the engineering side. Abstractions, decoupling, architectural stuff.

Right architecture: We want building something that sticks, moving the db into a sharded MySQL.

Once we hav a basic system in place, we then rearchitected shit. Half of Pinterest is engineers, about 100 of the 200. Many because of scaling, servers (caching, api, web). Then at some point they ran out of connections for memcache. There's also a high surface area (web, iOS, Android). When you scale, your intuition may no longer be accurate anymore. You need good data, ex: diff behavior for mobile users and web users? Turns out that when you use mobile, you spend more time using web.

We value pinners a lot. Google is engg, Facebook is engg+product, Quora is engg+design. We want to be more representation, and be more collaborative, so product+ux+engg.

When you grow larger, we can't have everybody talking to everybody. Someone has to own products, etc. Each service = git repo. Bugs aren't roadmapped, so it's hard to figure who's going to take care of the bugs (what level?). So we have to build a decision tree or map to help the debugging process, it worked.

Web first, then we create API for mobile, but we prioritized web. So there is a split between the web and the API. There's some inconsistencies between the API and the web, such as in search results. Then we want to be a full web app, to cache modules that haven't been loaded, so we made a code rewrite. We also redesigned anyway.

More moving pieces and points of failure, and it took 8 months to complete, but by 3 months we were able to get code up to production. Good thing we redesigned to same language. Stack is Python + JS + Jinja + Sass. In another company, we had to port to Scala, Scala is more functional so less problems with concurrency.

Feed quality: We want to have good content per pin. Machine learning, classifiers. But it's sometimes hard to classify "what is art" lol. But the categorizer also works, we improved engagement. Make sure the core competency has to be really good.

Growth: Weekly and notification email. This is the off-site channel to get people to come back. Send email when someone repinned your pin, so you can check stuff. Weekly email with recommendations of good stuff to look at. Third party email sender: Sendgrid.

Growth is a lot of small things that are chained together. Need to instrument and measure stuff.

## GrowthHacker.tv: Guy Kawasaki, Author, Reality Check

Bad: Forced immediate registration. Your lucky to actually have a company that discovers your company at first. But this registration thing is like creating a wall. It's like going to a restaurant and you're asked for a registration when nobody's here. Don't do it up front. It doesn't have to be the first thing ever, though.

You probably won't want to register for stuff immediately. So why would you ask another person to do it?

We want to make it very easy for people to share things. Just click random stuff! "Click to Tweet" XD.

People want to share stuff but I think email is just so powerful anyway. The signal-noise ratio is less in emails than in social networks.

Adoption is in the details and it does things really well.

Sell, don't just enable buying. You need to push things down people's throats. Either you're stupid or you're arrogant. Stupid if you think that people just do it once, it's like just a commercial you play just once. Arrogant if you think that people would really want to do the thing anyway. If you watch CNN and ESPN they run the identical thing at least a few times a day.

Push a ton! Think KISSmetrics Twitter. You would rather not risk losing 10 people for x gains? If there are a ton of people who love the product, the people who hate probably are people who won't buy it anyway.
																																																								
Separate distribution from virality. Guy is biased to super broad distribution. "I'm over-distributed" is a good problem to have. Why would you worry about exclusivity? You're not selling Rolexes and Porsches.

If you lack distribution, I don't see how virality could happen. Without a good product, why would you sell it? Marketers find distributors, product people/engineers find ways to make something viral, and both of them increase distribution.

FOCUS ON REVENUE. At the end of the day you make the sale or you don't. Who care about viral stuff because sales fixes everything. In terms of keeping everyone happy, sales is pretty easy.

Startup PR: It's actually just having a great product. It is a lot easier to evangelize good stuff rather than crap. -.-

Best advice: Get your ass on social media, if you're a restaurant, figure out how to get 60K followers or something. You always want to provide value. Social media is not a fad, it's here. When things have value, it's easy to retweet stuff.

##  GrowthHacker.tv: Andrew Dumont: Moz

FAQ section of the site can be used to get the long-tail queries for SEO. Put a call-to-action there.

Think of the questions that a user might possibly type in Google when they Google their needs.

Does long-tail really matter? It does! It's a much higher quality, in a lot of cases.

Manual outreach to the first customers: We reached out to the first 100 people individually. We asked for their feedback like legit personal. Mailchimp is good for doing things on a larger scale. Things like that are optimizing for the happiness of your customers. 

Extended free trials: This has accounted for 10K free trials. We go to startup accelerators and we offer a longer free trial on our product. We partner with the Global Free Accelerator and it provides incentive to the partner to distribute and the users to use.

They track competitor mentions, they do want to know when something is happening outside. It's sometimes easier to piggyback on existing press.

Double loop referral program (Dropbox). It works a bit. The 20% of sales might be a combination of different things.

Bearfight program: Big value is SEO value. You need to find ways to get good backlinks to you. We do something with our company list.

Social prospecting: Just looking at Twitter and listening to what they are mentioning. The goal is to provide value (truly becoming helpful), not just sending links back to you.

Video syndication: If you create any video content, we had this thing on Udemy, we offered free videos. When users sign up, then you can message them. This is essentially an email list. These are QUALIFIED LEADS. GrowthHacker strategy was that they sent a discount (timed for 48 hours) plug to udemy for this.

Add a gamification layer, we send a cool phrase when someone closes a sale. GH: At the end of the episode, the video is shareable.

Winback: When someone cancels the account, 60-90 days after, you come back to them with an extended free trial or something, you can tell them you added new features. Sometimes, people just don't want to be customers... for now.

Cancellation surveys are good to know what exactly happened. Make a likeable email. Just make a super funny email. So people will tell you what part of the service sucks.

Stride makes a quick little note and they send it out to the customers. Send a handwritten note, people love that. Hire a VA if you need. It's scalable.

Follow along. You are able to see the overlap between the two followers (Twitter double @ @ ).

Guides: Moz has a ton of guides, and that guide has been super super important to bring in the sign-ups. The same for Stride! The big key to doing guides is that you educate customers to become better customers. The more they know about SEO, the more value people get from Moz. The other thing is search. It's being searched on the domain. So whenever somebody links to the Beginner's Guide to SEO, it helps! They are REALLY REALLY VALUABLE, they take a lot of time but it is really useful.

Industry surveys: We become a source of information because we have all the SEO people. People come to you for the surveys and discussions and white papers etc.

Free standalone tools: We can take a loss at the leading sale with the expectation that we can make it back.

Growth to me is you don't know which channel is going to work. We just want to take bets. Over time we have a lower and lower quality for this. It's more of figuring out what channels are good and which are not.

Constantly be doing new things. Try 5, then if it fails, try 5 again.

## Neil Patel, KISSMetrics

He got TechCrunch +30% and GM +300%. Figure out what's causing the Traffic. Where is it coming from? For TC, this is Social. Let's remove the crappy channels.

Then we fix the double entries. Then cross-promote. Growth is hard but sometimes it's the common things that people don't look at.

Google Analytics has analytics but it just tracks things like views.

Power report: Show me all the people that did this within whatever customer segment etc.

KISSMetrics hits are all inbound. Social media, content marketing, SEO. It is about writing good content. At first it was just awesome content. Then we got writers and guest posts.

Learn how to execute really fast, use data to learn from your experiences. If you're not tracking your data, you don't know how you'll help yourself. Just ask yourself how you get customers or not. 

# GrowthHacker.tv: Georgiana Laudi

In a homepage, there are a million leaks. You want one goal to achieve. A standalone landing page won't let you do that. For campaigns it would really be good to have a 

## GrowthHacker.tv: Jimmy Soni, Huffington Post

You can't just be a good writer, you have to think about the other publishing thing.

UV: Unique visitors and PV: page views. We want organic growth, and the best is social networks. UVs and PVs are a great metric, but it's like looking at the final score as opposed to why. We look at time on site. I'm studying about social because that's where our ideal audiences are. I've got tools: audience views for everywhere on the site, granular dashboard of the site in 15 minute intervals and 1 hour intervals.

A lot of it is directing traffic. You can think of what I do as I want the articles that our audience likes and spread it to the other audiences. We're constantly refining that strategy.

Because of Facebook, you have to write great, attention seeking headlines. How do you capture enough information on the headline? IF they're browsing through mobile, then we remove ppt and video.

Our audience actually gets into trade policy, lol. If you can explain that in a simpler way, boom. Our audience loves to learn about 3-D printing. Things like this that if they study enough, they try it. The thing is though, we have to understand what people like our audience like.

The content actually has to actually deliver. The post has to say something awe-inspiring, counter-intuitive, and make sense. The headline gets the click, the content gets the share. So yes, focus on audience dev, but make sure the article is actually something people want to read. Ask yourself "why would anyone share this article"?

"If I had no context about this, is it enough to get me enough to care to click." It's also about choosing where to promote your content. At the end of the day I want each part of the piece is good that they like it and they share it. Earning 2 clicks from the user is a VERY HARD THING. It's a big thing, they are advertising themselves on FB. Nobody wants others to think that they read about Kim Kardashian, but they read it anyway.

The thing where in you have to split an article into a lot of pages, it doesn't work on mobile phones. 

The two biggest shifts were the rise of FB as everybody's newspaper, and the rapid increase of mobile. The thing about Google though is that you're capped by the number of people searching at a time. On FB though, the virality has a bigger reach than on Google. There is also going to come a time where your mobile traffic is going to overtake the web traffic. 

We poured a lot of investment into our mobile app, while it is for the hardcore fans, I think it is better if you focus more on the mobile web. Most probably your app might be used just a few times, everyone wants to say they like are invested in online publishing, but they aren't actually using it.

Huff web is not infinite scroll, just long. Huff mobile is an endless scroller. Part of thinking about content and social is making it so stupidly easy to share your content. We made our share buttons floating. Even persistent behaviors can help!

To convince other people, use data as a feedback loop. Study your competitors' presences in the social web. Most FB pages are badly managed. We have to use the data to inform them on what they do. Try to be unsentimental when you look at information. You have to be honest with your staff in what they can or can't do.

When you try to convince people who do creative work why focusing on traffic matters, the way to approach this is "do you want 100 people to read it or 100K people to read it." We've got to think about the possibility of the 100K or 100M people to see it. When is Twitter and Facebok traffic highest? To cut through the resistant, just say "we want to create good content, but we also want the content to be seen". We hire creative people who are also entrepreneurial, we want it. People who want to sell a book or something bla bla bla haha. Think that you are competing with people who share their photos of families, we have to compete with that.

What I look for:

- Are you someone who gets the bulk of your news from the web? If you check FB, Twitter for news, this means you have some knowledge of how people write for the web. You might not be consuming content in the way our audience it.
- I like people who have had to build something. 
- I need to find people who are exposed to social media and dissect this. (I can't go on FB anymore because I begin to think, how do I get people to click this thing.)

Read good books about the creative process and psycholoy. The mediums have changed but the content we appeal to haven't changed. Tobias Wolff, "This boy's life", Jason Hirschorn. Robert Carrow (power broker). It's the sheer amount of discipline on this book. He "wears a suit every day to an office so he can do it.

Behavioral psychology, awesome. Ask yourself a question: "When I share something, why did I share this? What does this say about me?"

## Nir Eyal

__The buckets of metrics are: Growth, engagement, revenue.__ All are necessary but not sufficient.

I see virality and engagement axes. __Viral without engagement sucks.__ There are plenty of businesses that are not viral but are engaging. The once in a decade companies do both.

Growth hacks are easily discoverable. There aren't that many secrets, but pretty soon everyone jumps on it because it closes up because the channel owner clamps down. Whereas engagement is different. There are secrets that you can get with engagement that your competition CANNOT COPY, because you understand your user.

I think the pendulum has changed from virality. Ex: Games are very tricky to predict engagement for, so it is hard to invest in.

Lean startup asks us to find painkillers over vitamins. But the companies (FB, Pin, Tw, Ig) all started as meh and "a toy" but it became huge! In fact Kodak was marketed as a toy to begin with. These products all started as toys and were dismissed as nice-to-haves, but their habit-forming potentials become bigger. 

Think of all the technology toys you have today, some people hate it at some point but They Have To Use It (such as email). FB, Tw, SMS becomes that.

Take something that is done offline and bring it online (Snapchat chatting privately, Facebook conversations).

Another axis: Whether the prediction of your future is consensus/not, or its correct. What you need to have is a non-consensus, correct opinion of the future. You want to think of an idea that people think are crap, and it becomes successful. (This is about network effects.)

Hooked is a design pattern. We had a penchant for building first. It's build-measure-learn, but why is build the first part? Isn't building the most expensive part of the three? We should probably start with learning and understanding our customers. We want to deeply understand our customers. We also want to understand what they can tell us.

Not only do we talk to cx and watch them, but we want to watch what they are doing offline. We get to authenticate what they are actually doing. If you cannot see the offline analog, then you have to do something better online.

The information for within the trigger is inside the emotion or routine that you have done. It might be something that they have done already, or whatever they are thinking already.

Remember that we hate feeling bad. Habit forming products latch onto these feelings. We turn on to the different devices: when we feel lonesome, we go on Facebook, when we are bored, we go on Pinterest, when we want information, we go to Google.

I'm a fan of authentic entrepreneurs because they feel the pain. They are scratching their own itch because they make their own narrative.

We want to go through the hook as many times as we can to get through the cycles. Simplest actions: Logging in and stuff. I actually prefer if users don't need to sign up, so they see the product immediately.

To form a habit with a technology, we have to invest in it. We have to put in something: data, time, preferably something that improves with use. Better with tech because our technology gets better with use. The more followers on Twitter, the better the product is. Higher reputation on Airbnb. More content in Instagram. Harder to leave!

When is a startup failing at that engagement phase? It's not that complicated, basically. When you design a product, how often do you expect users to come back?

What percentage of your new users are sticking around?

Two factors for flossing: The ones who did it more often, and the people who changed your product. Also, figure out if your product needs to be habit-forming. If your product requires habits, then it would behoove you to understand the pattern that has appeared time and time again, which is to create user habits.














It seems like there is a movement to replace today’s startup culture of hope and curiosity with one of smug superiority.

Why does this matter? Why should we care that the tone is tilting in the wrong direction? Why is it more important to find out what’s right about somebody’s company than what’s wrong?
