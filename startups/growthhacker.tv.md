# GrowthHacker.tv: Code School

Envylabs was very active in promotion but all the coursers were on their original domain.

Validation: You can’t get time back.

Understand the behavior of each user: who subscribes, clickstream.

Users came from railsforzombies.org. Where can we get free content in that they have to sign up to get free content.

We didn’t have a vertical: when we put a path together, it’s increased the user’s lifetime value.

Give them a lot of handholding, share their futures.

Referral: Good user base. People tweet on twitter about sharing. We have this Hall Pass campaign: how do we incentivize someone to share something?

“Hey we want to give you two days on out platform.” When they sign up on e-mail, you want to share this to others.

So you wind up with a free trial, and you have to invest by sharing others. The kids are in multiple courses 

Lock-in factor: When someone is locked in, the two days is just far enough, but they won’t get far into the course.

“Man I really need to finish this.” The 2 days is a decent enough to attempt to get, but short enough that you need to put a credit card in.

Reward is frictionless. “Hey it’s going to go away.” The share is just a button on the email.

Time sensitivity: Must share in 2 days or something.

Email: What are we trying to accomplish with this, what do we want our customers to learn? The welcome e-mail sends out features. The subscription welcome sends out features so the user can take advantage of all parts of the website.

As much as possible, we try to put things in MailChimp.

Users are segmented, so the emails are different and have different messages.

We use Mandrill.

We don’t want to over-email people.

The invoice email: Here’s what you did for this month. You got value for what you’re paying. If they don’t  do stuff, then just say “here’s what you could have done”. Then put the invoice.

Target market = developers, and some channels don’t work. Devs don’t look at ads. When you put resources in email, you make the money back.

Email is a very profitable channel. It has to be personal. Adding a smiley face on the subject line increased stuff. Even a small ASCII arrow on a tweet, it works.

How to capture emails? We offer a free course. Just the e-mail at first.

Onboarding: Focus on the pain points, and what we should do. There has to be some sort of story with the onboarding: “Hey, you’re doing so well with your code, check this feature out.”

“Let’s get people to understand that you learned these things.” Stories get shared in a way that other information doesn’t. If you can make things a story, then it’s a great psychology hack.

When someone is cancelling, we will call them a dropout because of the bad story about that.

If too fast to convert, that’s a problem. You have to time the discount not on Day 2, but you have to have this big gun later. We want to extract the right amount of revenue per customer.

Cross-targeting with other brands mean we are able to offer free stuff that aren’t even ours lol.

CodeSchool Local: We didn’t think about the logistics and it sucked. The meetups took a lot of time. When we send shirts internationally, we spend money on customs lol.

If you try and try shit, then something will work at some point.

Track what you fail so you don’t repeat it again.

What we want is to make the homepage dynamic based and the learning path dynamic.

Optimizely is awesome.

You need to take care of your engineer.

At the end of the day, a growth hacker is just a good marketer.

Referral campaigns: A lot of unknowns there.

Good UI: You always hit the right button, every time.

Analytics and measurement. You need to start narrowing in on your users.
# GrowthHacker.tv: Matt Ellsworth: VP Growth, Storefront

We want to make it easy to have offline stores.

We take professional photos too.

At the start, it’s more of trusting the gut and rolling with it in the early-stage, you have to do things brute-force, especially when you’re a small team.

Early stage: BRUTE FORCE. Do not cherry-pick because you’re still working on the engine, not the chrome.

Growth, like product, is about iteration. Get something shitty out, but just iterate it.

Messaging: Important for internal selling and external selling. Here’s how we segment our users on both sides, and here’s how we get the value for each of them.

It’s rarely about technology, it’s usually about words. One of the oldest growth hacks is to just use the right words at the right time. You have to reference things that the customer knows (what words do they like, and what words do they use).

Pricing: In SaaS, just highball people. For a marketplace, it’s different. We just try to share best practices with the people. It’s hard to price this because it’s super early (short-term pricing). We can go “what is a year’s worth, just divide it and add premium for the short-term.”

The first number you speak is the “highest thing I go”. If you start high with a SaaS, you can give a discount.

You need a product slide and story arc for your product. It’s your place to explain to people to say “why do we exist as a company.” We investigate the case studies, which you then show to the customers so that everyone (even the non-client facing guys) gets to understand why the company exists and why they are there.

Often the cheapest videos are actually the best ones lol, it’s easy to hire someone in Youtube.

There was a time where Matt was just in meetings with brokers and landlords and whatever, while not scalable, it needed to have some content on there. Being in front of people and getting them to trust you personally is how you can establish credibility early on.

Now that you have real listings, you don’t need to do that anymore. You have to learn when to transition from face-to-face to automated (sales to marketing).

Sales guys convert to marketing guys. The sales are usually the first ones to go lol.

People should be learning more skills so they protect themselves and they bring value to the company. It’s your responsibility to be employable. What are the assets I have, and what does the market look like?

Now, it’s all about value, provide value to the company.

For us, the supply side (stores) is harder to seed. It’s easier to get attention at brick-and-mortar than online when everyone is online. At first, they found us organically, but then when you put money in people’s pockets and they come back.

We don’t stop with the face to face, we’ll help you as much as we can, because we never want to stop cultivating those one-on-one relationship.

Paid is not so good channel, we want outbound and conversations with people.

If people don’t like your thing, then it’s okay. Actually you want people to hate you because if nobody hates you then you aren’t disruptive. As long as more people like you, then that’s okay.

When people fundamentally hate you, they might say some insights, but remember that they are a hater.

We make posters and shirts and it is something we spend on, but it is because we are an offline company.

MixRank data is legit but import.io, we need to learn how scrapers work.

## GrowthHacker.tv: Ash Maurya, Running Lean

The problem is that we just rush into the build cycle and eventually we run into the scaling problem.

I want to have that feeling that when I spend a significant amount of time and it is for naught, then I feel bad.

So I build a landing page just to get e-mails and see if I have an early market. To each of the e-mails I get, I send an e-mail to them asking why they would actually use this product. They provide me with the value proposition.

Once I hit 1K users, that’s when I took this experiment more seriously. It took 2 ½ months.

If you practice ent, it just takes a lot of tenacity, it’s a TON OF HARD WORK.

Too many ents are focused with the solution, but remember that what you want is a working business model.  You want to document your plan A and break it into component pieces.

Nobody reads business plans, they start making up stuff, but it is a work of fiction at that point. The goal isn’t creating a perfect model or plan.

There’s more information in the BMC than a business plan.
Remember: It’s harder to make things short rather than long!!!!

Interviewing the customers: The purpose is to go out there and talk with the customers.

One is physically talking with the customers. Second is to test them, and understand that we have secured the right customer.

In a problem interview: gauge the problem and what they are currently doing to solve the problem. Ideally you want to filter the problems people have.

When you do lean principle, it almost as if it’s cheating because the customer supplies you the information (lol).

Product launch: Have you built something that a customer actually wants now?

iPhone 1: It didn’t have some basic features such as cut/paste and multi-tasking, but they didn’t concentrate on those features anyway.

Pre-paying: We sort of want this.

MVP interview: When you have just 10-20 customers, trying to collect data is not significant, you have to do this face-to-face or over Skype type of person as possible. I need to have this notion of an MVP interview, we will help the customer get set up, and get a usability test in.

Even if it’s not exciting, you have to do this interview because it is the foundation.

Product-market fit: We can measure things like engagement and referral and see if you are actually hitting progress. This is with the number spikes, etc.

Don’t be a feature-pusher: just 3-5 people means you solve 80% of the problems. You discover the required features if you understand that “people buy iPhone because of this.” The next features are the pain points of your initial customers. What is lacking?

Usually we don’t keep feature logs because needed features will appear when they need it.

Pivot = NOT TRYING RANDOM STUFF.

Metrics: Baseline, cohort (not aggregate), have to know how to run experiments (split testing and A/B testing).

## GrowthHacker.tv: Dan McKinley, Etsy

Big data is used in Etsy to produce a recommender system and for search ranking.

Client-facing, everyone does experiments.

Checkout: You don’t want to see the ratio, you want to see the value.

Seller back-end is more engaged than the buyers.

There are some features that have never been used before. “Our first stab at everything is not working out.”

Experimentcalculator.com: Way of figuring sample size.

AB Testing: Nearly everything fails lol. Ex: bidding for stores to make things, that sucked.

Etsy doesn’t release a lot of lines of codes at once, it’s more of 100 lines/day, 30 times.

Infinite scroll: Premise was search was easier to use. We can’t find a way to do this without making things worse. What we did was we increased/decreased search times by 200ms. It didn’t matter so much.

Removing the search dropdown: Initially this was for handmade/vintage, but it got out of hand. To remove the thing, we had to:

Redesign marketplace, default to “all items”, rich autosuggest, suggest shops in items, add favorites filter, search bars on item, and kill the dropdown.

Each step is reversible, and the releases were small.

First: Add to left side of search.

Second: Add to the autosuggest a facet. This increased sales of vintage.

It turns out that casual users of the site didn’t know anything about this feature (dropdown).

The same with shops, we realzie that shops added to item results wouldn’t work.

Experiment with minimal versions of your idea, plan on being wrong (don’t be surprised if you’re wrong a lot).

Users hate opening things up in new tabs (unlike developers).

Infinite scroll, users bought less from searching.

Figuring out parts that don’t work: is it because it sucks, or because it doesn’t work.

Real-time data: good for operational stuff. If you want to test things, wait for a few days.
 
# GrowthHacker.tv: Tracy Chou, Engineer Pinterest

Good answer: Focus on the benefit, not the features! Don't make answers to "what is x" to be an engineering answer.

To make something: Technically we want shit but we want to know what is useful to the people: asking companies to pin shit, making rich pins actionable, making discoverable content.

Product first before technical, at first things looky hacky, but at least we can iterate from there. When you onboard new engineers, that's when you invest on the engineering side. Abstractions, decoupling, architectural stuff.

Right architecture: We want building something that sticks, moving the db into a sharded MySQL.

Once we hav a basic system in place, we then rearchitected shit. Half of Pinterest is engineers, about 100 of the 200. Many because of scaling, servers (caching, api, web). Then at some point they ran out of connections for memcache. There's also a high surface area (web, iOS, Android). When you scale, your intuition may no longer be accurate anymore. You need good data, ex: diff behavior for mobile users and web users? Turns out that when you use mobile, you spend more time using web.

We value pinners a lot. Google is engg, Facebook is engg+product, Quora is engg+design. We want to be more representation, and be more collaborative, so product+ux+engg.

When you grow larger, we can't have everybody talking to everybody. Someone has to own products, etc. Each service = git repo. Bugs aren't roadmapped, so it's hard to figure who's going to take care of the bugs (what level?). So we have to build a decision tree or map to help the debugging process, it worked.

Web first, then we create API for mobile, but we prioritized web. So there is a split between the web and the API. There's some inconsistencies between the API and the web, such as in search results. Then we want to be a full web app, to cache modules that haven't been loaded, so we made a code rewrite. We also redesigned anyway.

More moving pieces and points of failure, and it took 8 months to complete, but by 3 months we were able to get code up to production. Good thing we redesigned to same language. Stack is Python + JS + Jinja + Sass. In another company, we had to port to Scala, Scala is more functional so less problems with concurrency.

Feed quality: We want to have good content per pin. Machine learning, classifiers. But it's sometimes hard to classify "what is art" lol. But the categorizer also works, we improved engagement. Make sure the core competency has to be really good.

Growth: Weekly and notification email. This is the off-site channel to get people to come back. Send email when someone repinned your pin, so you can check stuff. Weekly email with recommendations of good stuff to look at. Third party email sender: Sendgrid.

Growth is a lot of small things that are chained together. Need to instrument and measure stuff.
