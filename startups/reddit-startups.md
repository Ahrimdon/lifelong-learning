I'm Josh, I run marketing at 2600hz and I've helped grow our business from 150K per year when I joined to multiple millions in revenue.

#### Content Marketing

I still think the best place to find content is where your customers chat and commisserate. For 2600hz, these are VoIP forums online and channel conferences offline. The trick to finding out what to write is to ask. It's crazy how much info people will give you if you just ask.

Having trouble finding something to write about? Call your top 5 customers and ask them what problems they're dealing with, then write about one.

#### Collapsing the Sales Cycle

How do you reduce the sales cycle? Set expectations. If you're a SaaS business with a free trial, tell your customers what they can expect to accomplish during the trial and then tell them what they won't be able to do if they cancel. In other sales processes it can seem rude to tell your customers your timeline. Lets be honest though, the people you're doing business with are human, they have to eat too. It isn't rude to explain your circumstances, it's honest. It's hard to confront someone in a consultative sale about a deadline, but getting this out of the way early is always a saving grace in the end.

Set expectations and timelines early. The fewer surprises in the end, the lower friction the sale.

#### Think Loudly

Today thought leadership is accomplished with research, discussion and integrity. It's ok to be wrong, as long as you admit your mistake, but you have to take a position or people won't respect you. In fact, trying to appeal to everyone fragments and shrinks your market. Even if your positioning is only for a small portion of the world, your customer base will always be much larger (and wider) than your target demographic.

Narrow your brand promise to widen your customer base.

#### Comments
- From someone working at a digital agency in London, take advantage of the stage that social media can bring if, and this is important, if it is used properly.
- From our experience, which is predominantly social media based, these sort of ads can sap your budget with little or no ROI. Personally, I tend to make sure everything links through to the specific product/service as it minimises the chance of someone clicking away from the site when they realise they have to navigate multiple steps before reaching their goal. So when it comes to retargeting, this is essential, if they navigated away from your site, you really have to work on why this is. Perhaps look into where people spend a majority of their time and if there is anything to make this more seamless upon return, do everything you can to make this happen!
