## Startups : This Week in Startups - David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at 37signals and creator of Ruby on Rails

Question about blogging and shit.

Jason: So we had a series of websites connected together that share common sales/platform/design, the problem today is it a more crowded space. You have to pick a niche and pick it really well. You have to be really willing to invest money and go slow. You need writing talent, brand, and readers. 

This company went too niche, you want to write stories that they can retweet or comment or something, that's a story of impact. Start with "can you write a story that can get retweeted ten times, then twenty times, then make the front page of Digg, etc." Think of it on a per post or a per author basis.

DHH: Started from gaming review sites (1997). Picked up PHP to do something (2001). 

Approach: "Okay, what can I do without money?" Do things on the side, don't just put everything in one basket. It's a misconception that startups need external financing. This is the preferred way to go in my mind. When you start spending other people's money, you start making bad choices. You aren't going to learn how to make your money when you get someone else's money.

Why would I do something and I won't spend my money on it? I would rather that if I have to scale, I scale with money off revenues. In BC we are on 1 server for a year. By the time we needed a new server we were far off.

Honestly if we get 1M new users then we have a good problem even if the servers crash because we get new money. The problem is if "having users" but not getting money means you are spending more money.

I could not give a rat's ass about market share if we don't have profits. For Apple, even if they have low market share, they have good profits. Profits matter. Not market share, not number of people, not technoloy, none of this shit matters unless it leads to profits. There has to be an easier way to get to profits without getting the super market share.

Even if FB is super profitable, it's not the same because a lot of people didn't win that. If you're relying on some kind of market switch, something happens such as ad market goes down or something. You can't bank on a switch or something. It's more risky.

I don't understand because there are so many models where the business is there. Selling stuff to people where you make money than you spend to build the stuff. The ads make sense for Google and Mahalo because they are Gateway services but way too many companies think "they work for Google, they'll work for me".

Practical thing: Once you get to a point where you have $2M and $10M this is very small. Every thing from here on is very incremental. I would rather have a job I love because I enjoy it. I enjoy working too much. The payday thing where you retire on an island will only work for 6 months.

If you're not working on the best idea right now, you're doing it wrong. You should just be quitting. You should be working on your best idea right now. This might be my best idea, even at 25. Most companies have their best idea anyway. MS, they make their money from Office and Windows, which was their first idea.

I love money, but it's not just because of that. *I believe that profits is the best way to know if you're doing something great for the world.* This is a good feedback mechanism.

Revenues don't matter, profits do. If you can't get the profit, you're doing it wrong. None of this matters if it doesn't lead to profits. The foundation of business is to generate profits!

People now think of the exit. The goal is scale that somebody else can use. What I'm annoyed about is that when companies buying something. The vast majority of acquisitions do not pan out. These are delusions of grandeur, some sense of insanity.

The model of VCs, M&A is broken. Why not just build a fucking profitable business which is the goal in the end anyway? Can't we just start there instead of chasing this bubble idea. These bubble games don't increase wealth at all.

We can't just go for the frigging All-Stars like the Facebooks and the Amazons. That's why we're here. There is just as much potential for small businesses. We have 4 products, MS has 2!

I'd much rather focus on the millions of companies rather than the 500 companies of the Fortune 500. It takes a ton of shit to sell, account managers, etc. I don't want the grind.

Look at Salesforce, 7% profit??? They're dealing with a lot of people, quality of life, I would not trade with Salesforce.

I enjoy the 37signals part more than if I was going to speaking engagements.  What interests me are scalable businesses, where there is no connection between the amount of capital that goes in and the amount of profits that comes out. There is no reason to believe that 37s can be 100x bigger without adding 15-16 people.

I would like to increase the $ made/employees.

Everybody feature creeps. There is a role to actually reduce complexity. 

The "not worrying about rent" is closer than you think... like half a million? You can live off of years without worrying about rent with that. 

I want to be in the business that I want to be in the next 20 years. The correlation of MS and Google and Yahoo's success is not the hours but the execution.

Consumers will go for less, as long it is better designed. (Apple iPhone without copy paste lol).

I like S3 because I hate haggling with vendors for price.

I think the interesting things would be things like Dropbox. The companies that IPO'd without profits (Groupon, Zynga, Facebook) are wounded. Groupon showed that you can spend $1.40 to earn $1.00 lol. They did this thing that you hide the "marketing expense", they said it was a "non-recurring expense". Dollars are dollars, if you spend them in compensation or expense they are expended.

So a lot of people did get fooled and money disappeared.

People are fucking cheerleaders. They love to cheer on a good stock when it's growing, and when they crash everyone would do "ooh this is shit". Even if it's the fastest selling thing.

I think the media is bad, but even the people. The numbers are not complicated. I don't even know this stuff, but the numbers don't make sense. So now they're trying these other things, but that's just a different kind of business. Because the core business is shit!

Then the problem is they are also killing the local businesses too. Their profits get cut and they get the worst customers too. Now this makes sense for a business with fixed cost like a spa. But no media person calls out the shit when it starts flying. Media is a herd. They see everyone stampeding into one conclusion and they rush there lol.

The problem was they hit everything at a fast throttle, and they could have just ran at a slower pace.

BTW, we don't know much about anything. We know that development for the web will beat development for the desktop. Those we knew in 2004, and those we think was a big deal. The only thing was not many people want to buy business software online. But Amazon was able to solve the "give credit card to me online" problem. 

At first, we just wanted like $4000/month profit, lol. I hate the narrative that "we need to risk everything is the way to go", since we had zero financial risk. It was just our spare time that we risk.

Consulting is such an underrated thing. The number of people that have access to the VCs are sort of the bubble. The vast majority of the world doesn't have access to lines of capital. Even since the 3 years since we last had this conversation, everything is cheaper now. It's never been more true re: the risk for starting a business, even technical stuff.

Ex: Sharding the database. We keep on thinking that we might get to the shard part, but Moore's Law just keeps on catching up lol.

Lots of companies, big or small, figure out that hey, remote is pretty cool. I think the secret is that the problems first with Yahoo is that you want clarity in them. If you don't have intrinsic motivation for people to work, you aren't a good place to work, remote or not, period.

I like what Apple did: "make four products - laptop for consumers, laptop for pros, desktop for consumers, desktop for pros". So you want to axe things, like Google, axing Google Reader. The funny thing is that Yahoo still makes money. It's not like they're bleeding money. They have a problem with focus, how can we motivate people?

The axing thing, I think we did it right when we said that "no new people can join". If you stop launching new features and stop growing, at least it's some kind of a sunset.

A company exists to have profits for the founders to keep.

Apple, I think is the best company ever in terms of consumer electronics. They can milk this for a long time, in the same way that Microsoft is profitable with stuff from the 90s (Windows and Office), in the same way Google is profitable with Adwords. 

Just Samsung is the company that can compete with Apple but they suck in software. Samsung has the operational efficiency to rival Apple. They're doing things good enough to make a profit, but they are mistaken to believe that this exists because they can outsource their software development to Google.

Google is the example of perfect example of having super wealth that they can squander money on toys, lol. I don't think the Search Engine adwords thing is going to happen again. This is where Apple is unique because people are still willing to overpay for _new_ products, not MS, not Amazon.

I built my lifestyle to be able to work at 37signals forever. I'm not jealous of the "I want a $5M playout" because it's fleeting. The game I'm in is maximum happiness for the maximum amount of time. I love writing what I want to write, make what I want to make, with the people I like, without being told by others on what the fuck I have to do. This is super happiness. I love working with all the people I work it.

I'm humble enough to know that Basecamp is the best idea I ever had. My sense of serenity is that I know that it really is the best idea. Enduring sustainable long-term success, how many companies really have it? To me, the greatest satisfaction is to know that these things lasted. Right now, I don't need to work, honestly. But I'm thinking that if I will spend my entire life here, I have to make it good for me lol. This is why I hate the "founders cash out" thing, cause the employees get left behind. If I'm spending 8 hours a day thinking about Basecamp and 37signals, I should make it an enjoyable thing.

We want the problems be like really small shit, stuff like coffee and parking and like that, because we can improve it as opposed to culture etc.
