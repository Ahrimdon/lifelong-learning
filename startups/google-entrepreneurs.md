## Managing Software Development

*Building trust*: Iterative software development. We have a sense of breaking the project down and we're doing highest value problem first.

We want regular deliveries of working software. We need working software every week. Fixed bid, you get the main functionality you need, and you can launch.

*Specifying software*: User stories. As a role I want features so that benefit.

Automated acceptance tests: Selenium or Cucumber and unit tests for testing edge conditions.

*Tracking progress*: Index cards on the wall. Pivotal Tracker for Ruby. Trello. Asana: Group tasks. Lighthouse. Jira.

## How to Hire a Great Developer

The importance of great: Every developer hits a point where they say "it's too hard." Things get slower when they get to that point. If you're creating a new application where it has never been done then you need the best.

*Whan OK is OK?* If it's content, you can often work with a developer that has less content. It usually pays to hire the best devs though.

*What is great?* They understand business and they understand technology. They should care about their craft. They should go to meetups and have blogs. They care about automated testing, automated build systems/rollbacks, best practices (pair programming, acceptance tests, unit tests).

The hard part about software is not taking requirements, but in the process of taking the reqs and turning them to code, they say they can't solve the problem. It's important to get developers who have a sense of product and business.

*Finding great developers?* They aren't looking because they're always being looked for by companies. First, technical meetups (these developers care enough about giving time to go there). Be interested in the tech they are actually using.

*Filtering?* "What VCS do you use? Why did you pick it?" Devs who don't use VCSes out there are like surgeons who don't wash their hands. If they are able to explain technical stuff to you, then they are good! Other questions: Unit testing framework and programming framework.

*Engaging?* If they actually care about the vision you have, they are more likely to join the team, and they are also likely to add value to the business.
