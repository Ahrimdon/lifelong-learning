## [Hack Design 12.1: What You Should Be Learning in Cx Development Interviews](http://www.cindyalvarez.com/communication/customer-development-interviews-how-to-what-you-should-be-learning)

*Core Question: “What should I be learning from this interview?”*

People are too polite to say no. People overestimate how much effort they’re willing to put into something. People think incremental and not disruptive.

#### What should you learn
- How is your customer currently dealing with this task/problem?
- What do they like about their current solution/process?
- Is there some other solution/process you’ve tried in the past that was better or worse?
- What do they wish they could do that currently isn’t possible or practical?
- If they could do [answer to the above], how would that make their lives better?
- Who is involved with this solution/process? How long does it take?
- What is their state of mind when doing this task?
- What are they doing immediately before and after their current solution?
- How much time or money would they be willing to invest in a solution that made their lives easier?

#### Ex: Online Grocery Shopping
- “Tell me how your household handles grocery shopping…”
- “How is the current process working out for you?” (You can prompt them by asking “how much time do you spend shopping”). They might not care enough to change their current habits.
- “Have you tried other approaches, like online grocery delivery or keeping a list on your iPhone?” If they try other approaches, then that is a good sign that this is enough of a problem that they’re motivated to fix it.

Even if the cx thinks they spend too much time grocery shopping, if they haven’t tried any approach to fix this, then they don’t care enough to try your product.

- “If you could improve anything about your grocery shopping routine, what would it be?”
- If you don’t have an idea, you could prompt them with “spend less time, less money”
- “If you had a cost-comparison tool, how would that make your life easier?”

5 Whys. Is it because they have to pay the lowest prices, or they want to cut down on trips, etc. *If they can’t answer this, then this probably won’t work.*

- “What people in your household buy groceries?” Figure out who the stakeholders are.
- “What do you do before and after you go grocery shopping?” Find out stakeholders.
- “Would you be willing to spend some money to get a cost comparison tool or other tools that would make your grocery shopping easier?” “Say, $10 a month?”
- If the cx says no, or says yes in a hesitant way, they won’t use the product.

#### Cindy Alvarez
- Abstract your problem by a level.  For example, if you want to know whether someone will use a healthy lunch delivery service, ask about "lunch"
- Start with an open-ended "Tell me about how you..." question.  i.e. "Tell me about how you deal with lunch during the workweek"
- Shut up for 60 seconds.  This is a LONG, LONG time and it feels awkward. It also forces the person to go beyond the short (and probably useless) answer and go into detail.
- Whenever you hear emotion in the person's voice, prolong that line of conversation.  (You can prolong conversations by asking why/how often/who/where questions.  It may take 2 or 3 or more of these follow-up questions to get at the interesting detail.)
- Avoid yes/no questions.  Whichever one the person chooses, it's probably not useful for you.
- Whenever the person starts complaining listen (and encourage it!)  People are more specific with complaints than praise, and specificity is where you learn.
- Challenge your pre-existing hypotheses by referencing the mythical "other person". For example, "I've heard from other people that ***.  Do you agree?"  It's easier for people to disagree with an anonymous third party than to disagree with YOU. 
- Avoid talking about your product or your ideas until the end - but then DO give the person the opportunity to ask you some questions.  This is NOT a chance for you to sell your idea, it's just an equalizer.  You've been asking questions the whole time, now it's their turn.
- Thank them profusely and reinforce one concrete point that you learned.

#### Max Cameron
- She also talks a lot about parroting answers back to interview participants. This usually leads to the participant giving you further clarification, and giving them time to think. You can start this off by saying, "So what you're saying is...."
- Keeping a conversation "open" as opposed to going through a true/false checklist still requires boundaries. If you want to talk about grocery shopping habits, going into a deepdive about the superbowl probably won't reveal new insight.- Set up some boundaries beforehand so when a participant gets totally off-topic, you can steer them back into a meaningful conversation.
- It's great if you can interview participants with a two-person team. One person leads the interview, the other takes notes. Any more than two interviewers typically intimidates participants.

#### Ryan Hoover
- Ask them to prioritize what feature to add.
- Let them sleep on it: You can interview them later again.
- You're better off not talking to cx rather than doing an interview.
- Find the Major Pain: Focusing on minor pains is dangerous.

#### Ben Yoskovitz

- Don't ask universal truisms such as "would you like to make more money" or "is hiring people hard". Frame it to "do you have a hard time recruiting great talent."
