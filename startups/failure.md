## [Startup lessons learned from my failed startup](http://www.sergioschuler.com/startup-lessons-learned-from-my-failed-startup/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6989971)

#### Validating the MVP

What was good: create a simple and fast website was sweet. The presentation video was pretty good too in my opinion. The Adwords was good to drive traffic too and got a fair share of people who gave me their email address (about 10% of people who clicked the ad).

What could be even better: “try it free” and free trials in general are good if you know your product rocks and you will convert the customer. However, when you are testing demand, it is not the best, because it invites people that are only curious, not really thinking of buying. So the best approach would be to put a price page, see who would click that and after capturing the email telling that the product is not ready and they won’t be charged anything just yet. I would probably get fewer prospects, but the people who did subscribe would be serious about the product.

Where it went wrong: I had all those people who were interested in the product. I judged the product “validated” (WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!) and went on to build it. Looking back, I cannot believe how stupid I was. I had all those people who said they were interested and the obvious next step was NOT building the product, but TALKING to the people who were interested. 

Where it went REALLY wrong: one of the prospects was an HR person from a huge Indian manufacturer. They wanted the system NOW and wanted to speak to me. I had a Skype call with them and what they wanted was clearly not what I was thinking to provide with Teamometer. Instead of surfing the wave and adapting my idea to what a real prospect client was telling me they wanted, I entered “sales mode” and sold them my idea, what it would be, how good it was. 

#### Finding partners to build the idea

Founder roles and expectations. Conflict and disagreement arrived early, because expectations of work and founder roles were not agreed upon and everyone had a different idea about their share of the load:

Since we were 3 business people, we spent all this time into idiot plans, budget forecasts, BUSINESS CARDS, fancy website… all useless things which in the end did not contribute to anything.

The result of this was that in the end we had to hire a full-time (and paid) developer. So we had zero revenue, 4 co-founders and a paid employee (which was effectively the only one doing real work).

I believe a company is the closest to marriage with kids among parents who (probably) don’t have sex or have any sort of romantic love for each other. If marriage with sex and love is already tough, imagine now without any of those things. I should have been much more careful with who to bring in the company. And, if I was convinced of their value, I should have agreed really really well what was expected from each partner.

#### (Don’t) multiply big numbers

Oh, silly you, you have no idea how hard it is to get 1.000 clients paying anything monthly for 24 months. Here is my advice: get your first client. Then get your first 10. Then get more and more.

#### SEO and social media bullshit

Related to the above: I wrote a damn article every effing day. It made us jump to the first page of Google in several important keywords. How did that translate to sales? Zero.

So the lesson is (unless your product is a multi-sided business like Facebook, where users are not paying customers) do not invest time and money to get more traffic. If you do, make sure to TALK to those people, because validating the product is more important than vanity metrics like how many likes you got on Facebook.

#### Hacker News Comments

General advice to non-technical founders, not specific to this post: If sales is one of your primary skill sets, and you cannot sell one developer on working for you, you may want to have a brief heart-to-heart with yourself on whether you are sufficiently skilled at selling to build a company which will live or die based on your sales ability.

I am not a developer, but I believe having an idea -> finding a developer is the wrong flow. It should be like this: 1. Have the idea. 2. Get customers who give you real money to build this idea. 3. Get a developer by telling "I already have paying customers".

The reason non-technical people have difficulty convincing developers to work on their ideas is that developers tend to look down upon non-technical people, especially "sales types." In addition, most developers have a thousand ideas of their own - you need to give them a reason to work on your idea instead. And that's a lot easier to do if you already have a version 1.0 out there that you have developed and have customers paying for it.

His advice about starting with 1 anchor client for a SaaS, expanding to 10 via expenditure of shoe leather, and then starting to worry about scalable approaches to customer acquisition is very, very good. (I don't know if I definitely would endorse the "An Indian company expressed desire to buy something from me other than the thing I was building, so I should have built that instead." That would turn on a lot of things, including how serious that company was about actually buying the thing. There is a world of difference between "I would buy a Widget from you" and "I commit to accepting delivery of a Widget from you, where a Widget broadly does X, my timeframe is Y, and your payment will be $Z." I'd be looking for a letter of intent or a check as a filter for seriousness following that Skype call before making a bet-the-business decision on it, personally, but I obviously don't know the specifics of what was said.)

The problem today is (out of the perspective of a developer): To many companies rely on just "hire any (cheap) developer" to ramp up the product. I see it all the time: Quality is not asked for, many companies (specially in the web business) just want the cheapest developers. They search for a student (at best), because he is cheap and will just make a small time estimation and an even smaller fixed price offer for the project. The student will happily work overtime that is not covered by the initial estimation.

You want to know how to validate your idea faster? Don't have a free plan. Will people give you their credit card... that's what you want to know. And those are the people you want feedback from.
