## How to Start a Startup?
--------------------------------------------------
##### Start with good people, make something customers actually want, and spend as little money as possible.

#### Idea

You don’t need a brilliant idea, what you need is to offer people better technology than the ones they are using right now.

That’s why online dating sucks: they think of dating as database matches instead of how it works in the real world.

NDA is fucking stupid. Ideas are worth something, but they’re not transferrable.

#### People

You need to get people who take their work a little too seriously.

* __Sales:__ Super tenacious.
* __Hacker:__ Will not sleep until bug is dead.
* __Graphics:__ Will feel physical pain if something is 2 mm out of place.

Programmers: were they genuinely smart, could they actually get things done, and could we stand their personalities? Remember that people who are smart do not need to act that they are smart.

Startups start around universities because that’s where smart people meet. What you should do in college is to work on your own projects. That’s the only way to learn how to program.

Founders should include technical people. Business people are bad at deciding what to do with technology because they don’t know what the options are.

Re: MBA, the things you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things. You’d need a business person though, to be able to focus on what customers want.

If you can’t understand users though, then learn how or find a co-founder who can.

#### What Customers Want

A large percentage of restaurants fail (1/4 the first year). But restaurants with great food prospers, no matter what.

In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn’t want the product.

Prototyping is not necessarily the best way to write every program, but it’s the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certainly wrong, so your first priority should be to figure out where.

Trade shows didn’t pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research.

Higher chance to win in niche markets rather than big consumer brands. Find places where things suck real bad.

Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it’s easier to sell to them. It’s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them use a lot of time and money to do it.

In technology, it is easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.

## You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss
--------------------------------------------------

A normal may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.

Dunbar number thing. Bosses are there.

Corn syrup. There is a lack of individual initiative in a large organization.

It's especially hard for programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new things. This is the inevitable consequence of bigness. F legacy code. You will learn more in a startup.

## The Word "Hacker"
--------------------------------------------------

To programmers, "hacker" connotes mastery in the literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants, whether the computer wants it or not.

Disobedience is a byproduct of qualities that make them good programmers.

Hackers see aggressive measures to protect IP as a threat to the intellectual freedom they need to do their job, and they are right. It is by poking about inside current techology that hackers get ideas for the next generation.

Hackers are unruly. Silicon Balley is in America, because in the other countries, people color inside the lines.

Hackers are smart-alecks. It's odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical. Computers are precise and methodical. Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh.

To hackers, the recent contraction in civil liberties seems especially ominous. That must also mystify outsiders. Why should we care especially about civil liberties? Why programmers, more than dentists or salesmen or landscapers?

I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people. Authoritarian countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. This is why hackers worry. The government spying on people doesn't literally make programmers write worse code. It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win. 


## What Startups Are Really Like
--------------------------------------------------
1. __Be Cafeful with Cofounders.__ What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character and commitment, not ability. This was particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don't pick cofounders who will flake.

2. __Startups Take Over Your Life.__ Running a startup is not like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens.

3. __It's an Emotional Roller-coaster.__ "The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me. One day, we'd think of ourselves as the next Google and dream of buying islands; the next, we'd be pondering how to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on."

4. __It Can Be Fun.__ I'm surprised by how much better it feels to be working on something that is challenging and creative, something I believe in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before. I knew it would feel better; what's surprising is how much better.

5. __Persistence Is the Key.__ "Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but going through it made me realize that the determination required was still understated." "I've been surprised again and again by just how much more important persistence is than raw intelligence."

6. __Think Long-Term.__ "I'm continually surprised by how long everything can take. Assuming your product doesn't experience the explosive growth that very few products do, everything from development to dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer than I always imagine." There is a positive side to thinking longer-term. It's not just that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than it should. If you work patiently it's less stressful, and you can do better work.

7. __Lots of Little Things.__ "It's much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic insight." 

	Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming. You won't get to, unless you fail. Which can be transformed into: If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.

	"I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to bring you success. It is never a single thing. Everything is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of those things until you strike something."

8. __Start with Something Minimal.__ Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a complete application and ship it.

9. __Engage Users.__ "I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments, and those that have a market show promising results extremely quickly."

#### Raising Money
--------------------------------------------------
To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it’s hard to switch from that to a product company.

__Seed money__ is used to pay for your living expenses while creating a prototype. You get these from angels. They know that this has to be decided on quickly. You sometimes don’t even need a business plan.

To get money, you should actually be a company, who will fix the incorporation and stock divisions.

Make sure that you do not have existing things that you have signed re: IP, such as the type that you have to have your thing owned by another company.

__Remember that most rich people are looking for good investments.__ To them, if you show up and say there’s a high chance of success, then you’re doing them a favor by letting them invest.

Next round: VCs. Approach them in advance because they can take months to decide. I’m inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.

Talk to as many VCs as you can, because they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, or if they are impressed, then they won’t invest in your competitors.

#### Not Spending It

Try to not spend money as much as possible. Google knew that and they knew that brand is worth next to nothing in search, so they never did any advertising.

There is nothing more valuable in an early stage of a startup than smart users. If you listen to them, they’ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product, and they’ll even pay you for it.

__VC money is not revenue.__ It’s money investors have given you in the hope you’ll be able to generate revenues. That money is not yours.

When looking for a space for a startup, don’t feel that it has to look professional. __Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls.__ Just rent an apartment¬–you want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?

Key hours for productivity are the hours after dinner–employees eat dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them.

The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. They are a recurring expense and they slow you down.

So who should start a startup: a good hacker, between 23-38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid over gradually over a conventional working life. Greater than 23 because you need to see what’s in an existing business before you try running your own. VCs also won’t take you more seriously. Less than 38 because it's demanding physically (few sleep) and you might have more obligations at that point (family).

Lessons: Don’t have a lot of meetings, don’y have chunks of code that multiple people own, don’t have a sales guy running the company, don’t make a high-end product, don’t let your code get too big, don’t leave finding bugs to QA people, don’t go too long between releases, don’t isolate developers from users.

__Understand that for the next 4 years, you’ll do nothing but work. If you aren’t working, your competitors will be.__

## How to Raise Money
--------------------------------------------------
Most startups that raise money do it more than once. Usually, you start with a few tends of thousands from something like Y Combinator, then raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then raise another round to accelerate growth.

It’s hard to convince people to part with large sums of money.

It’s hard to raise because it’s an alien world to most founders.

Investors are pinched between: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing out on startups that take off. The cause of all this fear: the fact that the successful startups grow very fast.

Don’t raise money unless you want it and it wants you. You need the money only for rapid growth.

Be in fundraising mode or not. Fundraising is super distracting because it becomes the top idea in your mind.

Always talk to them in parallel rather than serially. The biggest factor in most investors’ opinions of you is the opinion of other investors.

Don’t  get investors who say “I want to invest in you but I don’t lead” because that means “no, except yes if you turn out to be a hot deal”.

Pick just one guy to handle fundraising.
 
## How to Convince Investors
--------------------------------------------------
In startups, as in a lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power law, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep.
You need three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually) some evidence of success so far.

#### Formidable

Most investors decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change.

They're not necessarily trying to mislead you. Most investors are genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike startups.

A formidable person is one who seems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. Formidable is close to confident, except that someone could be confident and mistaken. Formidable is roughly justifiably confident.

What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more experienced founders. Investors are not always that good at judging technology, but they're good at judging confidence.

#### Truth

The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth.

Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll believe you.

I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn't, don't try to raise money.

To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert. If you're not a domain expert, you can be as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach some artificial deadline like a Demo Day. It's when you can convince investors, and not before.

But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you from wasting your time.
 
#### Market

Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors think of them as markets.

#### Rejection

The most common question you'll get from investors will be "who else is investing?"

The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve this problem by giving investors the impression that while no investors have committed yet, several are about to.

Experienced investors are well aware that the best ideas are also the scariest.

Because the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and the best startup ideas look initially like bad ideas, it's not uncommon for a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.

#### Different

And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language you used to convince yourself. You wouldn't use vague, grandiose marketing-speak among yourselves. Don't use it with investors either.

## Fundraising
--------------------------------------------------
Biggest cause of death for a startup: Dying because they didn't make what people want. Second: difficulty of raising money.

####Why is it hard to sell/raise?
- Brutality of markets. Cx doesn't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved their problems.
- Fewer than cx.
- Invstors are random: all investors are by ordinary standards incompetent.
- A ton of money is at stake, usually.

#### Tipz
- _Have low expectations._ Deals fall through.
- _Keep working on your startup._
- _Be conservative._ Approach fundraising as if it were always going badly.
- _Be flexible._ Know how much money to raise for survival, for getting office space/hiring people from school. Try to make a small round initially and expand when needed.
- _Be independent._ Investors like it when you're ramen profitable, because it shows you've thought about making money, instead of working on amusing and technical problems.
- _Don't take rejection personally._ VCs reject practically everyone lol. When you get a rejection, use the data that's in it, no waht's not.
- _Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).
- _Avoid inexperienced investors._
- _Know where you stand._ Investors are indecisive. They tend to resist committing except to the extent you push them to. It's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of info while making the minimum amount of decisions.

## Nerds
--------------------------------------------------
Being smart doesn’t make you an outcast in elementary school, not in the real world. But why does it make you an outcast in middle/high school?

All things equal, kids preferred being smarter than average, but it counted far less than physical appearance, charisma, or athletic ability. I think this is because the smart ones didn’t even want to be popular. I wanted to be popular, but not as how much I wanted to be smart. 

__To nerds, the thought of average intelligence would be unbearable.__

Teenagers are always on duty as conformists. Nerds don’t realize that it takes work to be popular. It’s something that you make yourself. Nerds are unpopular because they have other things to think about. __Popular kids learned to be popular in the same way that smart kids learned to be smart: from their parents.__

This is why their lives suck from 11-17. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after.

#### Why does persecution happen?

* Teenagers are still half-children, and many children are intrinsically cruel.
* People want to feel better by putting other people down.
* To become more popular, you want to bring yourself closer to other popular people, and nothing brings people close than a common enemy. You can create an enemy.
* Most persecution comes from the middle classes, because the most popular don’t need to stoop to such things.
* Kids also lose points from hanging out with nerds.

Adults know abstractly that kids are monstrously cruel to each other, but not really. Teachers are more of for keeping children in the grounds, not for keeping them in line.

For the real world, it’s not because “adults are more mature.” Adults in prison pick on one another. In the real world, there are repercussions for doing bad things. In school/prison, there is a bubble where everything is contained.

Schools are holding pens within a fake world: they keep kids locked up so adults can get things done. Which is okay except that the kids are forced to memorize facts and like football. And hating this means you’re a misfit.
