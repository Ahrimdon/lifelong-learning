## Part 1: Why not to do a startup

#### Great Things About Doing a Startup
- You are in control of your own destiny.
- You have the opportunity to create something new.
- You have the opportunity to have an impact on the world.
- The ability to create your ideal culture and work with a dream team of people that you assembled yourself. Have fun? Hypercompetitive? Super-focused? Global in perspective?
- Money. If done right, startups are lucrative. When things go right, we do very well.

#### Why Not To Do a Startup
- Emotional rollercoaster: You think you can own the world, then you think doom is just a few weeks away. There is so much uncertainty in startups.
- Absolutely nothing happens unless you make it happen. Big companies have established systems in place.
- You get told no -- a lot. Sometimes, the yes becomes a no.
- Hiring is a huge pain in the ass.
- Even if you actually hire someone, they usually don't work out.
- At some point you're going to have to hire executives.
- Super long hours. Employees can rest, but the founder can't.
- It's easy for the culture of a startup to go sideways.
- X factors can come along and slam things shut.

## Part 2: When the VCs say "no"

"No" doesn't mean anything -- the VC could just be having a bad day, or she had a bad experience with another company in your category, or she had a bad experience with another company with a similar name, or she had a bad experience with another founder who kind of looks like you, or her Mercedes SLR McLaren's engine could have blown up on the freeway that morning -- it could be anything. Go meet with more VCs.

Three VCs, coincidence. Five, six, or eight VCs, it's not a coincidence. There's something wrong with your plan.

Meeting with VCs after a bunch have said no is probably a waste of time. Instead, retool your plan.

- *Lay the groundwork to go back in later.* They might say "not right now". So take "no" gracefully -- ask them for feedback, thank them for their time, and ask if you can call again if things change.
- *Consider the environment.* We're in a much more rational environment than either of those extremes (fund everyone vs. hide from everyone).
- *Retool your plan.* Your challenge as an entrepreneur trying to raise venture capital is to keep peeling layers of risk off of your particular onion until the VCs say "yes" -- until the risk in your startup is reduced to the point where investing in your startup doesn't look terrifying and merely looks risky.
- *What are the layers of risk for a high-tech startup?*
    + Founder risk -- does the startup have the right founding team? A tech person + someone who can run the company.
    + Market risk -- is there a market for the product?
    + Competition risk -- are there too many other startups doing this?
    + Timing risk -- is it too early? Is it too late?
    + Financing risk -- hwo many additional rounds of financing will be required for the company to become profitable, and what will the dollar total be?
    + Marketing risk -- will the startup be ableto cut through the noise?
    + Distribution risk -- does this startup need certain distribution partners to succeed?
    + Technology risk -- can the product be built?
    + Product risk -- can the team actually build it?
    + Hiring risk -- what positions does the startup need to hire in order to execute its plan?
    + Location risk -- can it hire the right talent in that location?

#### Ideas on reducing risk
- Founder risk -- the tough one, maybe the VCs don't think the business person is strong enough to be the founding CEO.
- Market risk -- you probably need to validate the market at a practical level. Paying customers.
- Competition risk -- is your differentiation really sharp enough? Lots of startups do not have strong enough differentiation out of the gate, even if they get funded. *Never every say you have no competitors. Never every say "but if we get 2%..."* 
- Marketing risk -- make sure your differentiation is super-sharp, because without that, you probably won't stand out from the noise. Then, model out your customer acquisition economics in detail and make sure that you can show how you'll get more revenue from a customer than it will cost in sales and marketing expense to acquire that customer.

The most valuable thing you can do is actually build your product. When in doubt, focus on that.

The next most valuable thing you can do is get customers -- or, for a consumer Internet service, establish a pattern of page view growth.

Then, once you've done that, recraft the pitch around the new facts. Go do the pitches again. And repeat as necessary.

And to end on a happy note, remember that "yes" can turn into "no" at any point up until the cash hits your company's bank account. So keep your options open all the way to the end.

## Part 3: "But I don't know any VCs!"

The starting point for raising money from VCs when you don't know any VCs is to realize that *VCs work mostly through referrals*. 

The reason for this is simply the math: *any individual VC can only fund a few companies per year*, and for every one she funds, she probably meets with 15 or 20, and there are hundreds more that would like to meet with her that she doesn't possibly have time to meet with.

Therefore, submitting an unsolicited business plan to a venture firm is likely to amount to just as much as submitting a screenplay "over the transom" to a Hollywood talent agency -- that is, precisely nothing.

So the primary trick becomes getting yourself into a position where you're one of the 15 or 20 a particular venture capitalist is meeting with based on referrals from her network.

But first, "have your stuff together" -- create and develop your plan, your presentation, and your supporting materials so when you do meet with a VC, you impress her right out of the gate as a fundable startup by someone who knows what he's doing.

Pretend you've been turned down already, then fix whatever you need to fix.

Make a good first impression -- this requires thinking things ahread of time and doing all the hard work up front to make your pitch and plan a masterpiece.

The best thing you can walk in with is a working product. At least a beta or prototype of some form. Better if there is traction.

*When in doubt, work on the product.*

Don't bother with a business plan. Most VCs will either fund a startup based on a fleshed out Powerpoint presentation of 20 slides, or they won't fund it at all.

Qualify: Do extensive research on venture capitalists and find the ones who focus on the sector relevant to your startup.

#### Developing Contacts

*The best way to develop contacts with VCs, in my opinion, is to work at a venture-backed startup, kick butt, get promoted, and network the whole way.*

Or work for a well-regarded tech company like Google or Apple, or got to a major research university where tech companies regularly recruit, or transfer to a graduate school with connections to the VC community, or go to Y Combinator, or read VC blogs.

More generally, it's a good idea for entrepreneurs who are looking for funding to blog -- about their startup, about interesting things going on, about their point of view. This puts an entrepreneur in the flow of conversation, which can lead to interaction with VCs through the normal medium of blogging.

Finally, if you are a programmer, I highly encourage you, if you have time, to create or contribute to a meaningful open source project. The open source movement is an amazing opportunity for programmers all over the world to not only build useful software that lots of people can use, but also build their own reputations completely apart from whatever day jobs they happen to have. *Being able to email a VC and say, "I'm the creator of open source program X which has 50,000 users worldwide, and I want to tell you about my new startup" is a lot more effective than your normal pitch.*

Your alternatives in reverse (declining) order of preference for funding are, in my view: angel funding, bootstrapping via consulting contracts or early customers, keeping your day job and working on your startup in your spare time, and credit card debt.

## Part 4: The only thing that matters

If you look at a broad cross-section of startups -- say, 30 or 40 or more; enough to screen out the pure flukes and look for patterns -- two obvious facts will jump out at you.

First obvious fact: there is an incredibly wide divergence of success -- some of those startups are insanely successful, some highly successful, many somewhat successful, and quite a few of course outright fail.

*Second obvious fact: there is an incredibly wide divergence of caliber and quality for the three core elements of each startup -- team, product, and market.*

At any given startup, the team will range from outstanding to remarkably flawed; the product will range from a masterpiece of engineering to barely functional; and the market will range from booming to comatose.

- Team: Suitability of the CEO, senior staff, engineers, and other key staff.
- Product: How impressive the product is to one customer or user that actually uses it.
- Market: Number and growth rate of those cx or users for that product.

If you ask entrepreneurs or VCs which of team, product, or market is most important, many will say team. This is the obvious answer, in part because in the beginning of a startup, you know a lot more about the team than you do the product, which hasn't been built yet, or the market, which hasn't been explored yet.

On the other hand, if you ask engineers, many will say product. This is a product business, startups invent products, customers buy and use the products. Without the product there is no company.

Personally, I'll take the third position -- I'll assert that market is the most important factor in a startup's success or failure.

*In a great market -- a market with lots of real potential customers -- the market pulls product out of the startup.*

The product doesn't need to be great; it just has to basically work. And, the market doesn't care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product. And when you have a great market, the team is remarkably easy to upgrade on the fly. This is the story of search keyword advertising, and Internet auctions, and TCP/IP routers.

Conversely, in a terrible market, you can have the best product in the world and an absolutely killer team, and it doesn't matter -- you're going to fail. You'll break your pick for years trying to find customers who don't exist for your marvelous product, and your wonderful team will eventually get demoralized and quit, and your startup will die. This is the story of videoconferencing, and workflow software, and micropayments.

You can obviously screw up a great market -- and that has been done, and not infrequently -- but assuming the team is baseline competent and the product is fundamentally acceptable, a great market will tend to equal success and a poor market will tend to equal failure. Market matters most.

Well, first question: Since team is the thing you have the most control over at the start, and everyone wants to have a great team, what does a great team actually get you?

Hopefully a great team also gets you a great market -- but I can also name you lots of examples of great teams that executed brilliantly against terrible markets and failed. Markets that don't exist don't care how smart you are.

Finally, to quote Tim Shephard: "A great team is a team that will always beat a mediocre team, given the same market and product."

#### Can't great products sometimes create huge new markets?

VMWare is the most recent company to have done it -- VMWare's product was so profoundly transformative out of the gate that it catalyzed a whole new movement toward operating system virtualization, which turns out to be a monster market.

Understand I'm not saying that you should shoot low in terms of quality of team, or that VMWare's team was not incredibly strong -- it was, and is. I'm saying, bring a product as transformative as VMWare's to market and you're going to succeed, full stop.

#### Third question: as a startup founder, what should I do about all this?

*The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit.* Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market. 

You can always feel when product/market fit isn't happening. The customers aren't quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn't spreading, usage isn't growing that fast, press reviews are kind of "blah", the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close.

And you can always feel product/market fit when it's happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it -- or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can. Reporters are calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it. You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. You could eat free for a year at Buck's.

#### When you are BPMF (before product/market fit), focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit. 

Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don't want to, telling customers yes when you don't want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital -- whatever is required.

Whenever you see a successful startup, you see one that has reached product/market fit -- and usually along the way screwed up all kinds of other things, from channel model to pipeline development strategy to marketing plan to press relations to compensation policies to the CEO sleeping with the venture capitalist. And the startup is still successful.

## Part 5: The Moby Dick theory of big companies

The most important thing you need to know going into any discussion or interaction with a big company is that you're Captain Ahab, and the big company is Moby Dick.

When Captain Ahab went in search of the great white whale Moby Dick, he had absolutely no idea whether he would find Moby Dick, whether Moby Dick would allow himself to be found, whether Moby Dick would try to immediately capsize the ship or instead play cat and mouse, or whether Moby Dick was off mating with his giant whale girlfriend.

What happened was entirely up to Moby Dick.

The behavior of any big company is largely inexplicable when viewed from the outside.

Odds are, nobody inside Microsoft, Google, or Yahoo knows what Microsoft, Google, or Yahoo is going to do in any given circumstance on any given issue.

The inside of any big company is a very, very complex system consisting of many thousands of people, of whom at least hundreds and probably thousands are executives who think they have some level of decision-making authority.

The right deal with the right big company can have a huge impact on a startup's success.

The downside of dealing with a big company is that he can capsize you -- maybe by stepping on you in one way or another and killing you, but more likely by wrapping you up in a bad partnership that ends up holding you back, or just making you waste a huge amount of time in meetings and get distracted from your core mission.

### So, what to do?

*First, don't do startups that require deals with big companies to make them successful.*

Second, never assume that a deal with a big company is closed until the ink hits the paper and/or the cash hits the company bank account.

Third, be extremely patient. Big companies play "hurry up and wait" all the time.

Fourth, beware of bad deals.

Fifth, never, ever assume a big company will do the obvious thing.

Sixth, be aware that big companies care a lot more about what other big companies are doing than what any startup is doing. Hell, big companies often care a lot more about what other big companies are doing than they care about what their customers are doing.

Seventh, if doing deals with big companies is going to be a key part of your strategy, be sure to hire a real pro who has done it before.

Eighth, don't get obsessed.

Rare is the startup where a deal with a big company leads to success, or lack thereof leads to huge failure.

## Part 6: How much funding is too little? Too much?

Before Product/Market Fit, a startup should ideally raise at least enough money to get to Product/Market Fit.

After Product/Market Fit, a startup should ideally raise at least enough money to fully exploit the opportunity in front of it, and then to get to profitability while still fully exploiting that opportunity.

I will further argue that the definition of "at least enough money" in each case should include a substantial amount of extra money beyond your default plan, so that you can withstand bad surprises. In other words, insurance. This is particularly true for startups that have not yet achieved Product/Market Fit, since you have no real idea how long that will take.

#### So how much money should I raise?

In general, as much as you can. Without giving away control of your company, and without being insane.

There is one additional consequence to raising a lot of money that you should bear in mind, although it is more important for some companies than others.

That is *liquidation preference*. In the scenario where your company ultimately gets acquired: the more money you raise from outside investors, the higher the acquisition price has to be for the founders and employees to make money on top of the initial payout to the investors.

*Raising money is never an accomplishment in and of itself* -- it just raises the stakes for all the hard work you would have had to do anyway: actually building your business.

#### Some signs of cultural corrosion caused by raising too much money:
- Hiring too many people -- slows everything down, and makes it harder to react and change.
- Lazy management culture
- Engineering team bloat -- "Mythical Man Month" stuff.
- Lack of focus on product and cx.
- Too many salespeople too soon -- maybe they sell something that hasn't achieved Product/Market fit yet.
- Product schedule slippage -- "What's the urgency, we have all this cash!"

#### So what should you do if you do raise a lot of money?

As my old boss Jim Barksdale used to say, the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing -- be just as focused on product and customers when you raise a lot of money as you would be if you hadn't raised a lot of money.

Tell everyone inside the company, over and over and over, until they can't stand it anymore, and then tell them some more, that _raising money does not count as an accomplishment_ and that you haven't actually done anything yet other than raise the stakes and increase the pressure.

*The easiest way to lose control of your spending when you raise too much money is to hire too many people. The second easiest way is to pay people too much.* Worry more about the first one than the second one; more people multiply spending a lot faster than a few raises.

## Part 7: Why a startup's initial business plan doesn't matter that much

A startup's initial business plan doesn't matter that much, because it is very hard to determine up front exactly what combination of product and market will result in success.

By definition you will be doing something new, in a world that is a very uncertain place. You are simply probably not going to know whether your initial idea will work as a product and a business, or not. And you will probably have to rapidly evolve your plan -- possibly every aspect of it -- as you go.

## Part 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and firing executives

For the purposes of this post, definitions: An executive is a leader -- someone who runs a function within the company and has primary responsibility for an organization within the company that will contribute to the company's success or failure. The difference between an executive and a manager is that the executive has a higher degree of latitude to organize, make decisions, and execute within her function than a manager. The manager may ask what the right thing to do is; the executive should know.

However, in a startup, a successful executive must accomplish three other critical tasks simultaneously:

- *Build her organization* -- typically when an executive arrives or is promoted into her role at a startup, she isn't there to be a caretaker; rather she must build her organization, often from scratch.
- *Be a primary individual contributor* -- a startup executive must "roll up her sleeves" and produce output herself.
- *Be a team player* -- a startup executive must take personal responsibility for her relationships with her peers and people throughout the startup, in all functions and at all levels. Big companies can often tolerate internal rivalries and warfare; startups cannot.

*Hiring:* If you're not sure whether you need an executive for a function, don't hire one. Particularly before a startup has achieved product/market fit, it is often better to have a highly motivated manager or director running a function than an executive.

Hire an executive only when it's clear that you need one: when an organization needs to get built; when hiring needs to accelerate; when you need more processes and structure and rigor to how you do things.

*Second, hire the best person for the next nine months, not the next three years.* Hire for what you need now -- and for roughly the next nine months. At the very least, you will get what you need now, and the person you hire may well be able to scale and keep going for years to come.Q

*Third, whenever possible, promote from within.* Great companies develop their own executives. 

- You get to develop your best people and turn them into executives, which is great for both them and you -- this is the single best, and usually the only, way to hold onto great people for long periods of time.
- You ensure that your executives completely know and understand your company culture, strategy, and ethics.
- Your existing people are the "devil you know" -- anyone new coming from outside is going to have flaws, often really serious ones, but you probably won't figure out what they are until after you've hired them.

#### Key Things to Look At
- *Look for someone who is hungry and driven* -- someone who wants a shot at doing "their thing".
- *Beware people who have "done it before".* More often, you will be dealing with someone who is no longer hungry and driven.
- *Don't disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness* -- as long as she's not insane. Great executives are high-ego -- you want someone driven to run things, driven to make decisions, confident in herself and her abilities.
- *Beware hiring a big company executive for a startup.* The executive skill sets required for a big company vs a startup are very different.
- *Really beware hiring an executive from an incredibly successful big company.* The issue is that people who have been at an incredibly successful big company often cannot function in a normal, real world, competitive situation where they don't start every day with 80% market share.

Fifth, by all means, use an executive recruiter, but for sourcing, not evaluation. Betting that your recruiter is great at evaluation is not a risk you want to take. You're the one who has to fire the executive if it doesn't work out.

Sixth, be ready to pay market compensation, including more cash compensation than you want, but watch for red flags in the compensation discussion. You want someone focused on upside -- on building a company. That means, a focus on their stock option package first and foremost.

Watch out for candidates who want egregious amounts of cash, high bonuses, restricted stock, vacation days, perks, or -- worst of all -- guaranteed severance. A candiate who is focused on those things, as opposed to the option package, is not ready to do a startup.

You don't want your key executives focused on selling the company -- unless of course you want them focused on selling the company. Make your acceleration decisions accordingly.

Seventh, when hiring the executive to run your former specialty, be careful you don't hire someone weak on purpose.

A CEO -- or a startup founder -- often has a hard time letting go of the function that brought him to the party. The result: you hire someone weak into the executive role for that function so that you can continue to be "the man" -- consciously or subconsciously. Don't let it happen to you -- make sure the person you hire into that role is way better than you used to be.

Eighth, recognize that hiring an executive is a high-risk proposition.

Here's the problem: in my experience, if you know what you're doing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about 50/50. That is, about 50% of the time you'll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person. (If you don't know what you're doing, your failure rate will be closer to 100%.)

Why? People are people. People are complicated. People have flaws. You often don't know what those flaws are until after you get to know them. Those flaws are often fatal in an executive role. And more generally, sometimes the fit just isn't there.

#### Managing

First, manage your executives. While respecting someone's experience and skills, you should nevertheless manage every executive as if she were a normal employee. This means weekly 1:1's, performance reviews, written objectives, career development plans, the whole nine yards.

Second, give your executives the latitude to run their organizations. The whole point of having an executive is to have someone who can figure out how to build and run an organization so that you don't have to. Manage her, understand what she is doing, be very clear on the results you expect, but let her do the job.

Third, ruthlessly violate the chain of command in order to gather data. I don't mean going around telling people under an executive what to do without her knowing about it. I mean, ask questions, continually, at all levels of the organization. How are things going? What do you think of the new hires? How often are you meeting with your manager? And so on.

#### Promoting

You can clearly overdo this -- you can promote someone before they are ready and in the worst case, completely screw up their career. However, life is short, startups move fast, and you have stuff to get done. You aren't going to have the privilege of working with that many great, talented, high-potential people in your career. When you find one, promote her as fast as you can. Great for her, great for the company, and great for you.z

The surest sign someone is ready for promotion is when they're doing a great job running their current team. Projects are getting done, team morale is good, new hires are top quality, people are happy. Time to promote some people into new challenges.

I'm a firm believer that most people who do great things are doing them for the first time. Returning to my theory of hiring, I'd rather have someone all fired up to do something for the first time than someone who's done it before and isn't that excited to do it again. You rarely go wrong giving someone who is high potential the shot.

#### Firing

It takes time to gather data to evaluate an executive's performance. You can't evaluate an executive based on her own output, like a normal employee -- you have to evaluate her based on the output of her organization. It takes time for her to build and manage her organization to generate output. Therefore, it takes longer to evaluate the performance of an executive than a normal employee.

But, an executive can cause far more damage than a normal employee. A normal employee doesn't work out, fine, replace him. An executive doesn't work out, it can -- worst case -- permanently cripple her function and sometimes the entire company. Therefore, it is far more important to fire a bad executive as fast as possible, versus a normal employee.

Second, the minute you have a bad feeling in your gut, start gathering data.

#### A few specific things I think are critical to look for:

Is the executive hiring? If there are open headcount slots and nobody's coming in the door, you have a problem. Just as bad is when the new hires aren't very good -- when they're bringing down the average quality of the organization.

Is the executive training and developing her people? Often in a startup, an executive is hired to take over a function that's already been started, at least in rudimentary form. The people in that function should be noticeably better at their jobs, and highly respectful of the executive's skills, within the first several months at the very least. If not, you have a problem.

What do the other executives think? Great executives are often imperfect but their peers always respect them. If your other executives are skeptical of a new executive after the first few months, you have a problem.

Is it painful for you to interact with the executive? Do you try to avoid or cancel your 1:1's? Does talking to her give you a headache? Do you often not understand what point she's trying to make or why she's focused on such an odd issue? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you have a problem.

Third, fire crisply. In my opinion the two most common mistakes people make when they fire executives both fall in the category of pulling one's punches, and I highly recommend avoiding them:

- Long transition periods -- tempting, but counterproductive. Confusing, demoralizing, and just plain weird. Instead, make a clean break, put a new person in charge -- even if only on an acting basis -- and get moving.
- Demotion as an alternative to firing (or, alternately, "I know, we'll hire her a boss!"). Hate it. Great people don't deal well with getting demoted. There is an occasional exception. Unless you are positive you have such an exception, skip it, and move directly to the conclusion.

Fourth, don't feel guilty. Anyone who got a job as an executive at a startup is going to have an easy time getting the next job. After all, she can always paint you as a crazy founder, or inept CEO.
