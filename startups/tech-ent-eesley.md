# 1.1-Overview

##Objectives

* Articulate a process for taking a technology/idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity.
* Create/verify a plan for gathering resources such as talent and capital.
* Create and verify a business model for how to sell and market an entrepreneurial idea.
Entrepreneurship
* A management and leadership style that involves pursuing opportunity without regard to the resources currently controlled.

Tech Entrepreneurship provides the U.S. 3M new jobs/yr, is a key driver of global economic growth, and is either revolutionary, or evolutionary/incremental (something faster, better, or cheaper than what we have right now).

What we want to create is T-shaped people: people with a breadth of knowledge about design, innovation, leadership, and a depth of knowledge in a particular discipline.

# 1.2-Silicon Valley

Entrepreneurship is fundamentally about experimenting stuff on the market. Industry and research is complementary to a good university (Stanford). Historically SV has been involved for defense, gov't R&D, and the tech were disseminated to Stanford students. Students were encouraged to be entrepreneurs on campus.

## Why Silicon Valley

* Talent pool and social networks, everyone knows each other, graduates enter the workforce yearly.
* Loyalty to technology with a unique openness.
* Importance of immigrants (hence highly multicultural).
* Many early adopters of new technology.
* Job hopping culture.
* Services infrastructure: You have lawyers, accountants, etc.
* VC industry/angel investors provide help + financing.
* Entrepreneurial spirit.
* Role models (many have been here before).
* It's OK to fail, learn from it, and try again, at least you've learned something from failure.
* Flat organizational structures and meritocracy (if you have a good idea, try it).
* Lack of enforcement of non-competes (leaving a firm and making a competitor is okay).
* OK to talk and partner across company boundaries about common challenges.
 
# 1.3—Alexander Osterwalder: The Business Model Canvas

* Customer segments—the people for which you create value.
* Value propositions—bundles of products that create values for your cx.
* Channel to each customers—how you deliver value to your customers.
* Customer relationships—the type of relationship you establish with your customer.
* Revenue Streams—make clear how and for which price your biz is capturing value.
* Key resources—infrastructure required to create, deliver, and capture value. Which assets are indispensable?
* Key activities—what you need to succeed
* Key partnerships—how to leverage your biz model?
* Cost structures

# 2.1—Nine Key Frameworks for Entrepreneurship

## FW 1: Two Phases

* Opportunity recognition and pursuit of opportunity.
* Opportunity recognition: What we want is to fill in the disconnect between the market and the product/service.
* Pursuit of Opportunity: Putting the first few employees, getting resources and capital.
 
## FW #2: Byers, Dorf, Nelson

Vision → Strategy → Execution

* Vision: What do we want to achieve? What is our shared vision and goals? What is our story and what business are we in?
* Yahoo: Were they an Internet directory?
* Google: Is there mission to categorize the world's information (alongside a set of ads)?
* Strategy
* What distinctive competencies do we need?
* What resources will you need to achieve that vision?
* What kind of teammates do you need?
* What early hires do you have to make?
* Execution: Where do we find the talent? What processes do we use?

Fundamental Questions: Strategy

* Do we have the right strategy?
* Who is going to buy?
* What are we selling?
* Why are we better?

Fundamental Questions: Execution

* Can we do it?
* Who and what do we need?

## FW #3: Sahlman's Concept of Fit
 
* What kind of people do you need, what resources do you need, what's the deal so you can return the financial resources, is the market large enough to provide the financial rewards?

## FW #4: 3 Questions Every VC Wants to Know

* Big Market?
* Winning Strategy?
* Excellent Team?

## FW #5: Risk Reduction

* We want to minimize risk at every step
* Technology (can we develop this), team (can we find the right team), capital (can we raise capital), market (can they buy it)
* Biotech: Lot of tech risk
* Web startup: Are people going to come to the website?
 
## FW #6: Moore's Crossing the Chasm
 
* The problem is moving from innovators/early adopters to the early majority.

## FW #7: Blank's Customer Development Process
 
* Talk to customers to get the problems
* Verify if those customers really have a problem and create a sales plan
* Once you have a big company you can create an operational sales and marketing plan
* The process is not just coming up with ideas but asking if there is a customer need for your product.
 
## FW #8: Kaplan's Startup Race
* A startup is essentially a race against time to reduce risk and create value.
 
## FW #9: Effectuation (Reverse of FW #2)

Execution → Strategy → Vision

* What resources do I have now?
* What can I do with them?
* When we finish stuff, we can then create a broader strategy.

# 2.2—Business Model Testing, OAP Projects

A startup is a search for a repeatable, scalable business model. Once found, the startup scales up to a large company. A large established firm primarily executes on an existing business model. What Set up a blog or Lean LaunchLab and document your experimentation. Test things out by building a low-fidelity version of the website, create the front-end. Start showing the site to potential customers, testing customer segment and value proposition.

## Ann Miurin-Ko Ecorner

* At the seed stage, the business model matters, not the business plan.
* Business models show you what you want to happen on that shit.
* Startups go through each component of the business model: users, customers, pricing (customer lifetime), how you do customer demand creation, your sales channel, the supply chain.
* What's your value proposition to the customers, manufacturers, sales channels, how do you do demand creation?

## Past Opportunity Assessment Projects

Freelunch.com was supposed to bring students together to give high attendance for students. The market analysis was figuring out how many students are there. Revenue streams: caterers, group budgets. So they surveyed 130 students and investigated how many of them wanted free food at events. Their competition: Eventbrite and Facebook for setting up meet-ups. So they needed links between students, advertisers, and student groups.
 
# 2.3-Building the Cofounding Team

So, how big of a team? Larger teams tend to do better, but for class, teams of 3-4 are expected. Teams can get too big (slows decision-making, problems of not everyone contributing).

## What contributes to success for high-tech startups? (Scientific data)

* Venture capital backing
* Higher number of prior positions for cofounders
* Larger team sizes
* Functional diversity (number of different roles of people)
* Having a co-founder that has prior start-up experience
* Prior senior management experience
* Overlapping prior affiliations
* Team met via work, team met via research, and team met via socializing
* Number of prior startups acquired

## Other Research

* For most teams the cofounders all met at the same place rather than being assembled from many different contexts.
* For the more recent graduates, this distribution shifts away from work experience and towards ideas coming from socializing and research.
* Bases for ideas: 66% from Industry work, 15% networking, 10% research.

## What type of teams have a higher chance to get VC funding?

* Average number of prior positions
* Team size
* Having prior start-up and senior management experience

## Speech by a homie, forgot who

* Surround yourself with great people? Should you go with roommates?
* In a founding situation you can't easily get out of your founding members.
* You need to have the same core values: same goals, same objectives, what is success for each of you.
* Think of who is at the other end of the rope and think who's still going to be there even if you fail.

## Who to Look For?

* Startup experience
* Same vision/passion
* Skills that complement and match the venture strategy/industry
* Someone who you work well with
* Creative visionary & operations
 
## Chuck's Research (Good means merger/acquisition)

* Diverse team works for non-high tech.
* Diverse teams do worse for high tech companies, we want a technically focused team works for high tech companies.
* If you're going to compete with the industries, you'll want a diverse team. If you are going to cooperate with the industries, you'll want a technical team.

## Where to find them?

* Universities
* VCs
* Professors
* Professional network
* Recently cashed-out entrepreneurs in your industry
 
# 3.1—Brainstorming Fundamentals

## Rules

* Defer judgment – separating idea generation from idea selection strengthens both activities.
* Go for volume – best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.
* One conversation at a time – maintain momentum as a group. Save the side conversations for later.
* Headline – capture the essence quickly and move on.

## Setup

* 8 max, different areas of expertise.
* Bring toys and props unrelated to the brainstorm, they help to jog your thinking in unexpected directions.
* Provide munchies, sugar goes with new ideas.
* Seating: Not too near, not too far, space to move around.
* Lots of writing space on the walls.
* Bring lots of papers/markers.
* Right mindset: physical activity

## Char of Good Brainstorming Sessions

* Research from Germany:
* Better to brainstorm if you brainstorm separately then combine after. (Everyone looks for food by themselves and puts them together.)
* As one person is talking, it's difficult to talk other people.
* People withhold ideas from each other.
* The fear of being judged makes it harder for people to come up with ideas.
* Better to brainstorm electronically, and anonymously.
* Better to brainstorm if individual performance is judged and not collectively.
* Electronic brainstorming is the best. Not just in terms of number of ideas, but also in terms of quality of ideas and in terms of satisfaction.

## Brainstorming

* When one person is writing down stuff, this results in the blocking of other ideas.
* Reframe the problem to encourage brainstorming
* Facilitate and separate idea generation from idea screening.
* Think: In which area of the startup should we be novel?

## Form 15 Best Startups and 15 Worst Startups. Now pitch the Worst Startup Idea.

* To check the service, really ask people and check what demo is the most interested.
* Combine the creative visionary and an awesome operations/execution guy.

# 3.2—Guy Kawasaki: Make Meaning in Your Company

* How to make meaning: Increase quality of life, right a wrong, prevent the end of something good.
* Mission statement sucks. Too long. Mantra: Three or four words. 
* Ask women, because they don't have the killer gene.
* Milestones, assumptions, tasks.
* *Pitching: 10-20-30. 10 PowerPoint slides, 20 minute pitch, 30 point font on slides.*
* Lower barriers to adoption
* If you can't do it, don't.
* Get evangelists.
* Ask people why they are not buying your product why not.
* Ask people who are buying your product why.
* Suck down to the lower, more hungry levels such as the interns.
* Be a mensch. A mensch thinks, "I will help people for the sheer pleasure of helping people."
* Draw a hard line on your morality boundaries.
* When you die you are judged on "did you make the world a better place".
* Try to Bootstrap forever. (!)
* Evangelists find you. 
* The responsibility is to the company. Fire a weak soulmate.
* The most important thing I think you could learn for an entrepreneur is how hard it is to sell stuff.
* I would never start my career as a venture capitalist or an investment banker because it will fundamentally corrupt you.
* I think one of the best things you could do is go to work for startup that fails, because that is where you learn a lot.
 
# 3.3—Larry Page, Eric Schmidt: Google

* So, when we started Google people said, "Oh, you will build a better search engine, you know, why will that be good enough?"
* It's very, very, very important if you're starting a company to have the right people involve and I can't stress that enough.
* "Have a Healthy Disregard for the Impossible."
* The trick is to have the one that somebody's going to be interested because it's a good idea and not to be one of the thousands that come through all the time.

# 3.5— Building Your Company’s Vision

* A well-conceived vision consists of two major components: core ideology and envisioned future. The core ideology is unchanging while the envisioned future is what we aspire to become, to achieve, to create.
* Core ideology needs to be meaningful and inspirational only to people inside the organization; it need not be exciting to others.
* Core competencies should be well-aligned with a company’s core ideology and are often rooted it in; but they are not the same thing.
* A company must have a BHAG (pronounced Bee-hag), a “big, hairy audacious goal” — a clear and compelling unifying focal point of effort and a catalyst for team spirit.
* Check the article for excellent examples.

# 3.6—Bob Sutton: What Does a Creative Organization Do?

* In every creative act we could look at, essentially it was doing new things with old things.
* If you want to have fast creativity, you don't sort of just lock yourself in the room and only think of your own ideas.
* Encourage people to ignore and defy superiors and peers. The people who ignore and defy authority are often the most creative ones. Innovation happens despite management, not because of it. Management just has to get out of the way.
* Do not try to learn anything from people who say that they have solved the problems you have faced. Sometimes it is better to get people who are not biased.
* Best thing to ask if an organization is creative: "What happens if we fail?"

## Fresh Start 2002

* To find a few ideas that work, you need to try a lot that don't. It's a pure numbers game.
* Artistic geniuses don't necessarily have a higher success rate than other creators; they simply do more -- and they do a range of different things.
* Thinking up the dumbest and most impractical things that you can do is a powerful way to explore your assumptions about the world.

## Weird Ideas

* Hire people who reject how things are "supposed to be done around here." Surround those slow learners with fast learners who understand how to promote their creative ideas.
* Hire people who make you uncomfortable -- even those whom you dislike.
* Interview and occasionally hire interesting or strange people with skills that your company doesn't need at the moment -- and might never need.
* Use job interviews to get new ideas, not just to screen candidates.
* Encourage people to ignore superiors and peers.
* If you want innovation, you need upbeat people who know the right way to battle. Avoid conflict during the earliest stages of the creative process, but encourage people to fight over ideas in the intermediate stages.

# 3.7—William Sahlman: Managing the Risk/Reward Takeoff

* And to the extent you can get your customers to pay you early, it's an indication that you have that product that is compelling to them, that adds value to your customers. 
* Opps Recognition
* Lollipops that spin by themselves
* Golf is the shittiest sport ever
* Electric toothbrush = Manual toothbrush+lollipop spinner

## Four Key Elements of Ent Venture

* IP lawyer
* Designer
* Marketing
* Finance 
 
# 4.1—Technology Life Cycles and Diffusion

This is the patterns of how technologies evolve over time. Once the tech becomes more mature it is harder to get improvements. Disruptive innovation shows small amount of progress in the beginning before the innov burst and after the innov burst.
 
## 5 Factors in Adoption

* Relative advantage: How improved an innovation is over the previous generation.
* Compatibility: This has to be easily assimilated into an individual's life.
* Complexity or simplicity
* Trialability: Easy to be experimented on
* Observability: Extent that an innovation is visible to others. If more visible, easier to spread among the network.
* Autotune came from oil stuff, became hated, then became parody enabler.
 
# 5.1—Case Discussion and Business Models

## Gain a Basic Understanding of the Company

* Understanding: What does the company sell, to whom, how, and why do people buy it?
* Size of revenues: How big is the business?
* Growth of revenue and assets: How quickly is the company growing?
* Profitability of the business (several measures)
* Who are the key players in the situation described and what are their motivations?

## Understand the Financial Situation

* Cash flow: + or -?
* Short term cash position?
* How much debt?
Benchmark the company against competitors
* Measures of profitability, operational efficiency, how are the company's products differentiation from competition?

## Analyze the historical evolution of the company's financials

## Analyze the sustainability of growth and the cash burn rate
* How long will the company be able to maintain operations with the current cash position?

##Tips

* Do not write a fucking introduction.
* Build an argument, how do you get to the final answer?
* Read the case and learn to filter.
* Use the study questins.
* Use outside knowledge.
* Feel free to use outside knowledge.
* Don't just look up an answer, understand the perspectives of the people who were making it.
 
## Business Model Hypothesis

* Customers: Talk to as many customers as you can and understand which customers want to purchase the product and would they use it at all. 
* What age? Women or men? Why is it that they want your product or service?
* If a website, what is your value proposition?
* Others: Channels, revenue streams, cost structure, key resources, key partners, key activities
* People focus on the technical stuff, but you have to ask yourself, does anyone want to buy it? We need a resonance with customers and we need to spend time with customers.
* Planning works fine if you have a well-known market with a known technology and known customers. But these are not the situations entreps find themselves in. Because you are in a risky environment you need to find a method of experimentation to mitigate risk.
 
# 6.1—Customer Development and Lean Startups

* In addition to building a product, you want to build a set of customers to develop.
* Venture performance = Learning rate + product development + customer development + team + luck

## Startups vs Large Companies

* Startup: Unknown market, unknown product, unknown competitive dynamics
* Large companies: Known market, known product, known competitive dynamics

## As an Ent

* We want to move from the unknown to the known. And we use the scientific method to know what we need.
* We need to be able to do experiments with our startups.
* Pivot: Realizing you have a failed experiment or false hypothesis and trying again a new experiment.
Ent is a search/learning process
* Startup: Searching for a business model.
* Transition: Scaling up the organization.
* Large company: Execute a known business model.
* When people are doing startups, what happens more often than not is the "actual method."

## Jessica Mah

* Sometimes engineers want a beautiful code base when customers don't really want them.
* When you go out to the customers, you'll find out that they're not using the features that you want to implement and they want to put features that you haven't been thinking of.

# 6.2—Customer Development and the Business Model Canvas

* Requirements, Design/Architecture, Build, Testing/Delivery/Feedback
* Facts are often outside of your building (talk to customers, talk to industry veterans, talk to potential partners).
* Industry veterans and mentors: Much like peer-reviewed

## Steve Blank

* Can the founders actually sell something?
* If you can't go out and sell stuff, you can't be a good company.
* You need to understand how people buy and how people think about the problem.
How do you design experiments?
* Build lo-fi version, buy adwords, literally ask people for money
* You need to be optimistic that this would work, but you also need to be paranoid about the things that could fail.
* If you are too flexible, you cannot develop anything substantial. You also need to be persistent, you stick with an idea for too long.

## Random Study

* Optimism is negatively related to performance.
* Entrep experience is positive
* Dynamism is positive
* The more optimistic you are, the more negative the performance
* If the environment is dynamic, then it is better to be more paranoid.
 
# 6.3—Why is Cx Development so Tough

In some ways, listening to customers is obvious advice, but think of these examples: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Steve Jobs was a briliant visionary who would not listen to customers. This led to radical new products such as the computer. While this has merit, remember that not many people are Steve Jobs. :(

## Notions

* Rapid iteration
* Lean/raise the minimal funding
* Don't spend frivolously
* Hypothesis testing

## Lean vs Fat

* Advantages of lean: Greater return on investment, lose less equity, and maintain more control/flexibility.
* Advantages of fat: Some opportunities require $$ (you need this for top engineers and top talent), cushion in a downturn, competition.
* The lean startup is not necessarily about moving fast. You do everything so you  might forget things when you don't get fat.
* If you're going to compete with Facebook and Yelp etc, you need to be fat because they have really smart people.
* Stay lean until you reach product market fit and then scale up.

## Startup Metrics

* Large company: Cash flow statement, income, profit/loss statement.
* Startup: User Base (Registrations, activations, activation/registrations, retained 30+ days, retained 30+/total actives %, paying customers.
* Financials: Revenue, contributing margin, cash, burn rate, months of cash left.
* Customer acquisition: Cost per acquisition paid, cost per acquisition net, advertising expenses, viral acquisition ratio.
* Web metrics: Total unique visitors, total page views, total visits
 
## Debate Shiz

### Fat

* No way of knowing when you have product-market fit.
* Sometimes, you can lose your product-market fit (Netscape).
* Doesn't take into consideration a scary competitor.
* Sometimes you don't spend enough money for things you need.

### Thin

* We take into consideration the probability of a successful exit and we don't think that the money doesn't make it really easier. Cash might just increase the amount of delusion that you have. You might increase the value of the money, but you aren't really putting more value out.
* Why not just increase the capital when you scale up because it will reach that if you have a good product anyway.
* That's why the venture capital model works really well because the alignment of the needs are always aligned with each other. While you do need to get fat at some point, the lean model is good for the  first 1-3 years.

# 6.4—FlightCaster

* Jason Freedman
* 18 year old: He thought that his Student Lofts was really super cool. People want a loft so they can use the bed for sleeping in. This was a problem that had a super super simple solution.
* All companies have something in common: You are solving a problem that people want to solve.
* Openvote (failed): People talk about conversations in their college. Starting off, there are so few things that you know that you think that every single advice you get is good. And it turns out that people give advice which they think is right.
* And there are good advice and bad advice. Some of the good advice = find people in your exact position. Look for people 18 months ahead of you.
* Ex: Paul Graham, venturehacks, Steve Blank, humbledMBA, feld, 37signals, news.ycombinator, steveblank. Read everything here. Time will kill you because if you don't get product-market fit, you'll die.
* Unlearn bad habits. Don't build Powerpoints, build products that people want. Prototype!
* FlightCaster (predict flight delays): All companies kind of follow the same process.
* After people congratulate you for the first day, novelty wears off immediately.
* Optimize != iteration. If you iterate, sometimes you have to super change things.

# 6.5—Startup Genome

* More than 90% of the new jobs in the US are from the tech ventures.
* Most startups fail because of self-destruction rather than competition.

## What did they learn?

* 15K companies
* Premature scaling is a major reason of failure. This is when you fail to manage risk. How fast can you learn from your environment/from your customers?
* PS: Creating a plan and scaling it right away. 
* Discovery/validation: Do people really have this problem.
* When you validate things, you can then scale up.
* Sometimes, you write a complex product, or scale the team to bigger size without knowing if it would work or not.
* Companies that scale prematurely do not reach $1M.
* They are also valuable at first but ultimately, they lose funding.
 
## How can you identify premature scaling?

* Monetizing their user base early on. Instead of being in a search mindset, they are in an execution mindset. If you get too stuck trying to monetize, then you lose your listening and adapting ability.
* Only when you get the concepts right can you scale the company up. Most prematures outsource heavily, too.
* Prematures also think of product development more than customer development.
* Lines of code: Super high LOC at start. When you know the exact features that the customer wants then you write little code at the start. 
* Prematures have a very high valuation of themselves.
* Leans spend a lot of money for customer acquisition at the start. Prematures spend a lot of money at the middle, when they try to catch up.
 
# 7.1—Entrepreneurial Marketing

* Entrepreneurial Marketing: Either making it or selling it.
* What are the go-to-market strategies?

## Step 1: Opportunity Recognition

* Identify a market need, examine competitive dynamics, determine size/growth potential of the market
* Develop unique positioning, marketing objectives, set of go-to-market strategies
 
## How to cross the chasm?

* Put your eggs in one basket
* Then deliver a 100% solution to them.
* B2C: Age, gender, income bracket, brand loyalty
* B2B: Industry type, number of emps, geog, order size
* Segmentation ex: Pedigree Petfoods
* Premium: Dog as family member
* Moderate: Dog as a companion
* Economy: Dog as an animal

*Positioning Template: For (target cx), who (need), the (product) is a (category) that (statement of benefit). Unlike (alternative), we have (primary differentiation).*
 
## Positioning should drive go-to-market strategies

* Promotion and communication
* Pricing and business model
* Sales and distribution (inc. affiliate marketing)

# 7.2—Entrepreneur Sales and Marketing

* To get viral marketing, you have to please cx so much.
* Have a clear value proposition—why should a customer buy from you?
* Square wants to go to the influencers (bloggers, organizations), and then the product takes over.
* Perform several experiments: buy Google adwords, talk to bloggers.

## Demand creation on the web

* SEM, SEO, affiliates, marketing
* Sales funnel: Registered, log in, first conversation, paid once, subscription.
 
## Where do people buy my product?

* Sales channels
* Understanding the sales processes
 
## What to track?

* Customer acquisition cost
* Marketing cost
* Viral coefficient aka referral rate
* Cx lifetiime value

# 7.3—Acid Test

* Team: Cohesive
* Market: Has to be huge!
* Technology: Has to be impossible to copy.
* Customers: Name potential cx. You need to talk to them.
* Special Connections: Who do you know? It's not what you know, but WHO YOU KNOW. Same night, thank you!
* Financials: $$$$$.

# 7.4—Entrepreneurial Sales

## Elevator Pitch

* Practice them!
* What's in YOUR mind matters little, if it does not reach and penetrate THEIR minds.
* Show energy! But slow down.

*"All I need to do is make the presentation and give the demo. The product is awesome, it'll blow them away. As soon as I get in the door and explain the technology, they'll buy."*

*When you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers, you know something about it. When you can not measure it... your knowledge is meager and unsatisfactory. —Lord Kelvin*
 
## Your USER may be different from a paying CUSTOMER

* Ex: Receptionist will use the software but the owner will buy it.
* Sales: Understanding customer needs and matching them.
* To justify the risk of change, and of being a small company, you must be at least 5x faster, 5x better, and 5x cheaper than the known alternatives.
* How are cx currently solving their problem?
* How are their work processes going to change by using your product?
* Calculate their change.

## Present Like Steve Jobs

* Set the Theme: "Today we are going to reinvent the phone." "Today we are going to fix the quota."
* Make your theme clear and consistent. 
* Provide the outline. "I have four things that I'm going to tell you today."
* Open & close with a clear transition. "And I'm done with that. Let's move on to this." Make it easy for listeners to follow your story.
* Demonstrate enthusiasm. Wow the audience!
* Sell the experience, not the hardware. Make numbers and statistics meaningful, add context. "12GB? That's enough music to go to the moon and back."
* Make it visual. Use very little text, paint a simple picture that doesn't overwhelm. Short on bullet points, big on visions. Jobs includes videos. Make it a show!
* Identify a memorable moment and build up to it.
* Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.
* "And one more thing...", they feel they have an added bonus.

## Sales is a Search

* Goal is a replicable, scalable process before founders delegate sales.
* Three questions
* Why buy anything? Why buy our product? Why buy now?
 
## Sales/Lead Generation Experiments

* Consumer: Networking, social media, influencers, blogging, website, media/press, advertising, SEO/SEM
* Business: LinkedIn, network/advisers, associations, cold calling, webinars, analysts, alumni network, unsolicited emails
 
 
# 7.5—Trialpay

* Companies will pay to acquire customers. You're probably worth $1K to Comcast, $2K to Geico, $300 to a telco.
* For transactional sites, it is nice to advertise stuff there.

## Vertical Focus
* Win the vertical first (Facebook: Harvard). If you have room to grow in your region, you don't expand.
* Expand the product 

### How to conquer the vertical?

* Personal experience
* "Friends of family"
* Sales, marketing, and channel deals

### Channels (Ex: Hilton)

* Aggregators: Expedia, Priceline, Orbitz
* Agencies: Travel agencies
* Airlines: Delta, Continental
* Direct to cx: While lucrative, this is insufficient for cx.

### Thinking of channels, web for Trialpay

* Referral: Web.com: "We'll give you money to give us customers."
* Integration: Before you buy something on another site, you will see TrialPay
* When pursuing channels, look for those with high feasibility vs to high benefit
* They made download.com because they had:
* They can distribute 64K products
* If we integrate to download.com then it is a competitive advantage for us
* Bi-directional relevance: Has to be great and relevant for both parties
* They built a model for the possible sells for download.com

### Defensibility

* If you connect with other sites, then there is more defensibility for you.
* Channels should not compete with each other on price, but channel partners can be offered different economics. (For channels, they have to have a different market than yours.)
* This is where the "suggested retail price" comes in, because it literally is a suggested retail price, but channels will choose to sell at different prices.

### Proven Distribution Channel? Expand

* "We have download.com" made sales pitches easy.
* Check things out from: defensibility (harder to copy if you have channels), distribution,  and profitability (things have to add up to the bottom line).
* Complementary goods! Hilton+Hotels.com, Pepsi+Pizza Hut, etc.
* Ideally, you want to have the relationship with the cx, and not just the channel partner

# 7.6—Domainr

* Domainr: Looks for possible domains, given a name.
* Revenue: Affiliate commissions. Domainr sends clicks out to specific web sites. If you get a really good user experience, you will have traffic out.

# 7.7—Ulu Ventures

* Self-inflicted failures: Have already been funded, but they die with a bad team.
* Problem is overconfidence and conflict. Boards can help that.

## Why Create a Board

* Legally charged with responsibility/legally required
* Accountability
* Objective feedback (because they are still an outside perspective) can give you better decisions
