Entrepreneurship is a kind of management.
IMVU: Instead of spending years perfecting the tech, they built an MVP, an early product that is terrible, full of bugs.
They had customers in the early days, which they asked for feedback.

Lean Startup Method
-------------------

* *Entrepreneurs are everywhere.* Def of a startup: A human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.
* *Entrepreneurship is management.* A startup is an institution, not just a product, so it requires a new kind of management geared to its context of extreme uncertainty.
* *Validated learning.* Startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable business.
* *Build-Measure-Learn.* You turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere.
* *Innovation accounting.* We need to focus on boring stuff such as: measuring progress, setting up milestones, and how to prioritise work.

Why Startups Fail
-----------------

The first problem is the allure of a good plan, a solid strategy, and thorough market research. Startups do not yet know who their cx is or what their product should be. Planning and forecasting work only when you have a long, stable operating history and a static environment. Startups have neither.

Part One -- Vision
==================

Chapter One -- Start
====================

Many entrepreneurs take a "just do it" approach, avoiding all forms of management. This leads to chaos more often that it does to success.

There is a loss of manufacturing jobs in the US, but the total manufacturing capability is still increasing even as jobs continued to be lost.

A comprehensive theory of entrepreneurship should address all the functions of an early-stage startup venture: vision and concept, product development, marketing and sales, scaling up, partnerships and distribution, and structure and organisational design.

Startups have an engine called the *engine of growth*, wherein the markets are diverse, but they all operate with the same engine of growth. 

* Every new version of a product, every new feature, and every new marketing program is an attempt to improve this engine of growth.
* The second important feedback loop is between the driver and the steering wheel. The feedback is so immediate that we don't think about it, but it is steering that differentiates driving from other forms of transportation.
* Unfortunately, too many startup business plans look more like they are planning to launch a rocket ship than drive a car. There are too many prescribed steps.
* The LS method is designed to teach you how to drive a startup. Instead of making complex plans based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the *Build-Measure-Learn* feedback loop.

Chapter Two -- Define
=====================

Entrepreneurial prerequisites: proper team structure, good personnel, a strong vision for the future, an appetite for risk taking. If you have those and are lacking something, something like a spark, you need a methodology to which you are held accountable.

If I'm an Entrepreneur, What's a Startup
----------------------------------------

*A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.*

Startups use many kinds of innovation: novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing tech, devising a new business model, or simply bringing a product or services to a new location.

An importunity part of this definition is the context in which the innovation begins--startups are designed to confront situations of extreme uncertainty.

The SnapTax Story
-----------------

Companies like Intuit are good at creating incremental improvements to existing products and serving existing customers (sustaining innovation) but struggle to create breakthrough new products (disruptive innovation).

The SnapTax team was assembled from within Intuit. Their executive sponsors created an "island of freedom" where they could experiment. They started with a team of five.

What allowed SnapTax to innovate was a process deliberately facilitated by Intuit's senior management. Innovation is a bottoms-up, decentralised, and unpredictable thing, but that doesn't mean it cannot be managed.

TurboTax can make changes live on its website on Thursday, run it over the weekend, read the results on Monday, and come to conclusions starting Tuesday, rebuild tests on Thursday, launch the next set on Thursday night.

The problem is with leaders and middle managers who have been successful because of analysis. *I believe that a company's only sustainable path to long-term economic growth is to build an "innovation factory" that uses Lean Startup techniques to create disruptive innovations on a continuous basis.* Leadership requires creating conditions that enable employees to do the kinds of experimentation that entrepreneurship requires.

Chapter Three -- Learn
======================
Unfortunately, "learning" is the oldest excuse in the book for a failure of execution. It's what managers fall back on when they fail to achieve the results we promised. Entrepreneurs are widely creative when it comes to demonstrating what we have learned.

In the LS model, we are rehabilitating learning with a concept I call *validated thinking*. Validating thinking is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup's present and future business prospects.

Instant Messaging
-----------------

The top three networks controlled more than 80 percent of the overall usage. This is because there are high switching costs (customers would have to convince their friends and colleagues to switch with them).

At IMVU we settled on a strategy on building a product that would combine the large mass appeal of IMs with the high revenue per cx of 3-D video games and virtual worlds. Because of the near impossibility of bringing a new IM network to market, we decided to add on the existing ones. Thus, cx would be able to adopt the IMVU virtual goods and avatar communication technology without having to switch IM providers, learn a new UI, and bring their friends with them. 	In order for this product to be useful, cx would *have* to use it with their existing friends.


Launch
------

Nobody even used the product at first. Revenue was from $300 to $400 per month, starting with friends and family. They were making the product better but their cxs did not use it. The failure for them to use this software made them move customers into their offices for in-person interviews and usability tests.

IMVU early days: 17 year old girl testing the product, having fun customising the avatar, when it is time to use the IM feature, she asks what that was. When she was asked to invite her friends, she wanted to know first if the product was cool before she sent invites out. She thought that her friends would think that she sucked if the product wasn't cool.

Cx wanted to try things out first before they invite a friend. (Single player mode.) The feature that made it cool was ChatNow, where they can meet someone that they didn't know. 
That's when they thought it was cool.

Instead of integrating IMVU's friend list with AIM, they decide to have a stand-alone IM network. As it is, they used many IM clients already. They did not consider learning the new IM a barrier.

They thought that they wasted all the months making the inter-IM capabilities work.

Value vs Waste
--------------

*Value is anything that provides benefit to the customer; anything else is waste.* In manufacturing, cx don't care  how a product is assembled, only that it works correctly. Anything that did not contribute to learning about the customer was a form of waste.

Validated learning: demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup's core metrics. It is easy to kid yourself what you think your cx wants. It is also easy to learn things that are completely irrelevant.

When they understood their cx better, they were able to improve their products. Positive changes in metrics became the quantitative validation that their learning was real. This was important because they can show their stakeholders that they were making genuine progress.

Ex: They changed the phrase "avatar chat" and "3D instant messaging". They were able to see that the people in the experimental group were more likely to sign up for the product.

Ex: They thought about hiring CSRs to serve as "tour guides". It didn't work; the toured people were just as likely to be active or paying cx.

They could have done massive PR stuff but over time the fundamentals of the biz world would win out and the PR bump would pass.

Lessons Beyond IMVU
-------------------
* Low-quality prototype.
* Charging customers from day one.
* Use low-volume revenue targets as a way to drive accountability.
* The question is not: "can this product be built" but "should this product be built" and "can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services".

4 -- Experiment
===============

Zappos
------

Founder Nick Swinmurn could have waited a long time, insisting on testing his complete vision complete with warehouses, distribution partners, and the promise of significant sales. He ran an experiment: *customers were ready and willing to buy shoes online*. To begin, he asked local shoe stores if he could take pictures of their inventory. In exchange for permission to take the pictures, he would post the pictures online and come back to buy the shoes at full price if a cx bought them online.

Experiment: Is there sufficient demand for a superior online shopping experience for shoes?
* It had more accurate data about cx demand because it was observing real cx behaviour, not asking hypothetical questions.
* It put itself in a position to interact with real cx and learn about their needs.
* It allowed itself to be surprised when cx behaved in unexpected ways.

Break It Down
-------------

The *value hypothesis* tests whether a product or services really delivers value to cx once they are using it. The *growth hypothesis* tests how new cx will discover a product or service. Once the program is up, how will it spread among the employees, from initial early adopters to mass adoption throughout the company?

5 -- Leap
=========

Facebook was validated by the measurement that more than half of the users came back to the site every single day. Facebook also grew extremely fast. Facebook paid nothing for cx acquisition, and its high engagement meant that it was accumulating massive amounts of cx attention per day.

In FB's case, it was clear that advertisers would pay for cx's attention. The first step in understanding a new product or service is to figure if it is value-creating or value-destroying. MLM = profitable in the short term but value-destroying. Example of value-destroying kinds of growth: continuous fund-raising and paid advertising.

Toyota important: cx because the kids occupy the rear of the vehicle, and the Sienna would ned to appeal to children.

Numbers are important but it is the cx that are breathing, thinking, and buying individuals. You need to see their behaviours. Even if you sell to biz, they are made of individuals. The facts we need to gather are outside the building.

Start of Intuit: Calling random people and asking questions about their finances ("is it frustrating to pay your bills by hand?").

Traditionally, design is monolithic and you have a huge deliverable. Now, we are trying to compensate for that using lean UX. The cx archetype is a hypothesis and not a fact. The cx profile should be considered provisional until the strategy has shown via validated learning that we can serve the cx in a sustainable way.

6 -- Test
=========

Groupon: "Group coupons". First buyers: 20 bought the two-for-one sale at a Chicago pizza store. Company was intended to bring people together to solve problems they couldn't solve on their own, such as boycotting a retailer or fundraising stuff.

An MVP helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible. At IMVU, the fact that they were earning money, although it was super low, was proof that it was providing value for cx. The gross numbers were small because we were selling the product to early adopters.

The original iPhone lacked basic features such as copy and paste, 3G Internet speed, and support for company email. Google's original search engine could answer questions re: Stanford and Linux but it would be years before it could "organise the world's information."

Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing. An MVP ranges in complexity from extremely simple smoke tests to actual prototypes complete with problems and missing features.

Leap of faith: "We assume 10% of our cx will sign up". Dropbox: It works at such a deep level that the user experience is the same regardless of device (Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android). Because of this competitors find it hard to copy Dropbox. The prototype of Dropbox was a video demonstrating what it should be. The video was full of references to pop culture. It made the waiting list from 5K to 75K.

Sometimes you need to exert effort to get that one customer, and hopefully that cx can serve as an archetype to the other cx.  This is similar to someone running a biz where there is personalised service per person.

Aardvark: A series of functional products, each designed to test a way of solving this problem for their customers. Each product was then offered to beta testers. Each prototype was tested with a backend human. Eight people managed queries, classified conversations… series A was raised before the system was automated.

As they refined the product, they brought in people to react to the mockups, prototypes, and simulations of what they were working on. By pivoting and pivoting, Aardvark was acquired for 50M by Google.

*If we do not know who the cx is, we do not know what quality is.*

Many famous products were released in a "low-quality" states, and cx loved them. Ex sa IMVU: they used stationary avatars first. Even if cx wanted moving avatars, they hacked it by making "teleporting" avatars, no walking and no obstacle avoidance. Cx really liked the avatar teleportation (they liked it really good).

7 -- Measure
============

People think that accounting is dry and boring, a necessary evil, but that it because accounting is something that is taken for granted. Accounting has allowed GM to set clear milestones for each of its divisions and then hold each manager accountable for his or her division's success in reaching those goals. Accounting is the key to their success.

Employee-employee viral adoption rather than traditional sales process. Better to have concrete numbers re: features that your cx likes and your cx doesn't like.

MVP: Learning milestone. An MVP allows a startup to fill in real baseline data in its growth model--conversion rates, sign-up and trial rates, customer lifetime value, etc.

One the baseline has been established, the startup can work toward another learning milestone: tuning the engine. Each product development, marketing, or other initiative should be targeted at improving one of the drivers of its growth model. If a company spends time improving its design to make it easier for new cx to use, this means that *activation rate* is important to drive growth.

The MVP would set a horrible baseline and converge to something like the ideal one established in the biz plan.

IMVU: They assumed that the low sales at the start was because of the ugliness of the product. They improved the product but there were no changes in the way of biz results.

They allocated 5 dollars per day to buy clicks on AdWords. These bought 100 clicks per day. Cx flows govern the interaction of cx with a company's products.

It was easy to say that "people who didn't use our target product were not in our target market." The problem was that, why weren't the cx using the product despite the many improvements. Ex: they proved that users didn't want to use IMVU with their existing friends. The signs of a successful pivot: the new experiments you run are overall more productive than the experiments you were running before.

Optimization vs Learning
------------------------

If you are building the wrong thing, optimising the product or its marketing will not yield significant results. A startup has to measure progress that a sustainable business can be built around its products or services. Maybe it is not the engineers but it is the people calling the shots who are wrong.

Learning milestones prevent this negative spiral by emphasising that the company is executing with discipline a plan that makes sense. You have to have a working model of growth (not ad buys or channel stuffing) in order to make sure that your business is sustainable.

Vanity metrics: Things that look good but really aren't. Ex: You may have an increased cx base, but the yield is not improving.

Ex: Social learning. When studying, you either spend time with experts, spend time by yourself, or spend time with others. Grockit offers the three formats of studying. Grockit is an excellent case study because its problems were not a matter of failure of execution or discipline.

Agile practice: One-month iteration cycles. For each sprint, Farb (founder) would prioritise the work to be done by writing a series of user stories. Each feature was expressed in plain language in terms everyone could understand. After each sprint, they collected feedback from cx in the form of anecdotes and interviews that indicated that at least some cx liked the new features.

Problem: Grockit had wrong metrics (number of cx, number of ?s answered). Their metrics would change month-to-month from gross usage to user registration to something else. So they couldn't draw clear cause-and-effect inferences.

In order to test stuff they did A-B testing to figure out what worked and not. Same content but different design, and to figure out if the new design was effective, all you needed was to keep track of the sales figures for both groups of cx. It turns out that many improvements that engineers like aren't liked by the customers. It is only by testing that you get to know whether things are really working or not.

Kanban stories: Either in the backlog, actively being built, done, or in the process of being validated. Move features from one to the other.

Lazy registration: Students were already using the service before registering for the service. Cx would have to adopt something already before they started creating. Because of this, you need three users: unregistered, registered (trial), and premium version users.

It turns out that those which used the traditional registration did the same thing as the ones under the lazy registration.

Are our 40K new cx from 40K clients or from a guy with an active web browser? Are they from a marketing campaign or PR push? What is a hit--does it mean loading a few things or the entire page? 

Good to have every employee have a fresh copy of the site metrics every day in their inboxes. You can also make the analytics a product of the product team, accessible to anyone with an employee account.

*Only 5 percent of entrepreneurship is the big idea, the business model, the whiteboard strategising, and the splitting up of the spoils. The other 95 percent is the gritty work that is measured by innovation accounting: product prioritisation decisions, deciding which cx to listen to, having the courage to subject a grand vision to constant testing and feedback.*

8 -- Pivot or Persevere?
========================

Startup productivity is not about cranking out more widgets or features. It is about aligning our efforts with a business and product that are working to create value and drive growth. Successful pivots put ins on a path towards growing a sustainable business.

Votizen
-------

Initial concept involved four leaps of faith:
* Cx would be interested enough in the social network to sign up. (Registration)
* Votizen would be able to verify them as registered voters. (Activation)
* Cx who were verified voters would engage with the site's (Retention)
* Engaged cx would tell their friends about the service and recruit them into civic causes.

First three months: 5% registration, 17% activation.

Next two months: adding new product features, product design: 5% to 17% registration, and 17% activation to 90%. Retention: 5%, referral: 4%.

Next three months: Optimize, split test, refine pitch, talk to cx, held focus groups, countless A/B testing. Retention just up to 8% and referral just up to 6%.

Problem is: pivot or persevere. He has experimented with the product a ton of times and has did numerous tests. In Valley speak, this is "getting stuck in the land of the living dead." He is alive but not living up to the expectation of his founders and investors.

The more money he sunk into the idea, the harder it is to pivot. Also, because he had not wasted energy on premature PR, he was able to make a decision without public embarrassment.

Pivot modes! Recurring feedback
* "I always wanted to get involved, this makes it so much easier."
* "The fact that you prove I'm a voter matters."
* There's no one here, what's the point of coming back?"

David changed Votizen into @2gov, a "social lobbying platform". @2gov allows them to contact their elected reps quickly and easily via existing social network such as Twitter. @2gov translates digital contact into paper form, and the congress members receive printed letters.

Instead of being engagement-based, it was transactional. Next MVP: 4 months, 30K. Results from next round: Registration 42%, activation 83%, retention 21%, referral 54%. However, paying activists: less than 1%.

To get paying cx, he changed to a B2B model. He hired new eng'gs but there were no new sales. B2B sucked.

Next pivot: he built a self-served sales platform where anyone could become a ccx with just a credit card. You can help new people get involved. Now, the rate of growth was viral. 51% reg 92% activate 28% retention 64% referral, 11% revenue ($0.20 per message).

Reasons Why Ents Take a Long Time to Pivot
------------------------------------------

* Vanity metrics allows ents to form false conclusions and live in their own private reality.
* When an entrep has an unclear hypothesis, it is hard to experience complete failure and pivot.
* Acknowledging failure can lead to dangerously morale.
* Path: released MVP, though it was not targeted at technology early adopters. Limited to 50 people. Cx liked the intimate moments even though the press hated it.

Wealthfront (kaChing)
---------------------

Virtual trading, can build real portfolio, but based on real money. The idea was to find amateur traders who lacked the resources to become fund managers but who possessed market insight.

Viral engine of growth: Free to play but a percentage of players would want to convert to paying cx once Wealthfront started offering real asset management services. Almost no one signed up for the services (only 7 good traders and < 100 paying cx).

It turns out that successful professional money managers felt they had nothing to fear from transparency because it shows that their skills are valid.

Money managers faced significant challenges in managing and scaling their own businesses. It's hard to service your own account and they needed to require high minimum investments to screen new clients.

Their pivot was to provide a service that allowed cxs to invest with professional managers. Now everything is better.

IMVU again
----------

Cx segment pivot: The company realizes that the company it is building solves a problem for cx but they are not the cx you originally planned to serve. So while they were breaking metrics and getting funding, they were already having diminishing returns (a good sign of a pivot).

Activation rate: Super low. They tried: Usability improvements, new persuasion tech, incentive programs, cx quests, game-like features. In aggregate, the changes were negligible.

They change the design by thinking of a new cx archetype. So they redesigned the site. While initially the new design was unsuccessful, it eventually performed better. Revenue doubled to 25M annually.

Types of Pivots
---------------

* Zoom-in: A single feature in the product becomes the whole product.
* Zoom-out pivot: A single feature is insufficient to support a product, so the whole product became a feature of a bigger product.
* Cx segment: The product solves a real problem for real cx but not the type of cx it wants to serve. Hypothesis is only partially confirmed.
* Cx need pivot:  We discover other important problems that can be solved by our team.
* Platform pivot
* Biz architecture pivot: High margin low volume or high volume low margin.

Part Three -- Accelerate
========================

Chapter Nine -- Batch
=====================

It is faster to envelope 100 letters one-by-one rather than process-by-process. Plus, you get to test immediately if there is something wrong with the letter and envelope.

Small batches made factories more efficient. In LS, the goal is to try to build a sustainable business.

Continuous deployment
* When a defect is found, it is removed as soon as possible.
* Everyone on the relevant team is notified of the problem.
* The team is blocked from introducing further changes, preventing the problem from being compounded by future mistakes until the root cause of the problem is fixed.

Continuous Deployment Beyond Software
-------------------------------------

More and more industries are seeing their design process accelerated by the same underlying forces that make this kind of rapid iteration possible in the software industry.

* *Hardware becoming software.* The latest phones and tablets are sort of screens connected to the Internet--their value is determined by their software. (This includes cars.)
* *Fast production changes.* When the design changes, there is no excess inventory of the old version to slow things down.
* *3D printing and rapid prototyping tools.* Faster to build prototypes than those made with injection moulding.

Toyota--the most advanced system of management in the world, and also has the most advanced learning organisation in history.

Chapter Ten -- Grow
===================

Growth comes from…
------------------

* Word of mouth. "I can't stop telling my friends about it."
* Side effect of product usage. Fashion or states drive awareness of themselves whenever they are used. Ex in Paypal: when you send money via Paypal, the other person is informed.
* Funder advertising: Paid out of revenue, as long as the cost of acquiring a new cx is less than the revenue the cx generates, the excess profit can be used to acquire more cx.
* Through repeat purchase and use. Subscription, voluntary repurchase…

Companies using the sticky engine of growth track their attrition rate/churn rate very carefully: churn rate is defined as the fraction of cx in any period who fail to remain engaged with the company's product.

Don't use generic metrics such as total number of cx. Sometimes there are new cx, but they are also leaving constantly.

Ex: Hotmail's "Get your free e-mail at Hotmail" along with a clickable link. Tupperware house parties: encourage other cx to become Tupperware representatives.

What we want is a viral loop greater than 1: a person will tell more than 1 person about your product. Even at 1.1 ratio, there is a significant growth due to compounding. True test of voluntary hypothesis: a voluntary exchange of value between cx and the startup that serves them.

Eleven -- Adapt
===============

Friendster effect: High-profile technical failure just when cx adoption is going wild. Training programs were for new hires: they can be productive on their first day of employment. 

Speed still needs to be regulated. "Stop production so that production never has to stop." (Toyota)

Five Whys -- Taiichi Ohno. When doing things, ask yourself this always because we aren't making things that aren''t important. Repeated Five Whys sessions revealed that problems caused by lack of training were slowing down product development.

Fighting the Five Blames: Make sure that everyone affected by the problem is in the room during the analysis of the root cause. Usually, whoever is left out becomes the target for blame. Senior people should say: "if a mistake happens, shame on us for making it easy to make that mistake." We told new hires, "if our production process is so fragile that you can break it on your very first day of work, shame on us for making it so easy to do so." (Not "you're fired if you break this!")

*Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time… never allow the same mistake to be made twice.

The more specific the symptoms are, the easier it will be for everyone to recognise when it's time to schedule a Five Whys meeting.

In their zeal to get started with the 5 Ws, IGN neglected these:
* To introduce 5W to an organisation, it is necessary to hold 5Ws sessions as new problems come up.
* Everyone who is connected to a problem needs to be at the 5Ws session.
* At the beginning, take a few minutes to explain what the process is for and how it works for the benefit of those new to it.
* They do these talks on Friday so that developer would fix the bugs on Monday.

Intuit uses a tracking survey called the "Net Promoter Score" to evaluate cx satisfaction. Since it measures core cx satisfaction, it is not subject to major fluctuations.

Improvements -- Year 2
----------------------

* Smaller teams. Shift from large teams with uniform functions to smaller, fully engaged teams.
* Achieve shorter cycle times.
* Faster cx feedback, testing both whether it crashed cx pcs and the performance of new features.
* Empower teams to make fast decisions.

Improvements -- Year 3
----------------------

*They built a virtualisation system that allowed them to run multiple versions of QuickBooks on a cx's computer. The second version could access all the cx's data but could not make changes to it. So cx can test things and provide feedback.

Chapter Twelve -- Innovate
==========================

Successful innovation teams must be structured correctly in order to succeed. Internal startup teams required support from senior management to create these structures.

Recommended to have startup teams that are cross-functional (have full-time representation from every functional department in the company).

Entrepreneurs need a personal stake in the outcome of their creations, usually through stock or equity. The stake may not be financial (naming/ownership).

Create a platform for experimentation ("island of freedom"). Use actionable metrics so you can actually interpret the data you have. Expect to have managers sabotage your plans if their department will be weakened.

Creating the Innovation Sandbox
-------------------------------

* Any team can create a true split-test experiment that affects only the sandboxed parts of the product or service.
* One team must see the whole experiment through from end to end.
* No experiment can affect more than a specified number of customers.
* Every team that works inside the sandbox uses the same metrics to evaluate success.

Problem with product managers is that they stick with the product they create so they can't create a new one.

Programmers expect to be coding all day long. That's shy traditional work environments frustrate them because there's a ton of meetings, handoffs, and bosses being assholes. The individual efficiency of these specialists is not the goal in a Lean Startup. We want teams to work cross-functionally to achieve validated learning.
