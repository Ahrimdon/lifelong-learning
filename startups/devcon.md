## Real World Software Engineering - Calen Legaspi, Orange and Bronze

So I showed you that just to give you an idea of the training at Orange and Bronze. So Orange and Bronze is around 200 people now, we started the company about 8 years ago. We want to practice sofware engineering, software development at the highest level. So we try to get the best and the brightest and we try to provide them with the best training and the best learning environment.

I asked this question a while ago: How many semester of Java do you guys have?

Audience: One.

Okay. So, I guess all of you know the data type double, right? 

Audience: Yes.

Calen: How about BigDecimal? You're never supposed to use Double for financial calculations. Think about it. How do you represent 0.5 in binary? Everything, all numbers, all values, are stored in a computer is in binary. Any fraction is not exact, it's an approximation, and when you do calculations, nagkaka-rounding error.

So if you try to store decimals as binary, 

So my topic isn't Real World Software Engineering, because that's going to take an hour. I only have 15 minutes, so I'll just go through some random stuff. I usually take time to teach new programmers so they can join our company, and some of the stuff you learn in school, that doesn't really prepare you for real-world Java programming.

For example, double. When you use double, you get rounding errors. So what we use in the real world is BigDecimal. So it stores how many decimal places you want to have. There's some issues with performance, but in general, if the precision is more important, use BigDecimal. I don't know if it cost them their job, but it probably cost them a few nights.

Sa Strings, iba ang handling ni Java. Back in the day when memory was expensive, they created a workaround in Java called the String Pool. Their rational is for example, mahal yung instantiation
