## Less Accounting

#### Landing
- Friendly Faces
- Explainers could be more emphasized
- Screenshot doesn't make it easy to visualize using the product
- Call to action lost
- Social proofs and testimonials

#### Signup
- FAQ sa start

- Thanks for joining would be nice :)
- The UI is filled with things that describe themselves.
- Cute puppy.

## Vimeo
- "Your Videos Belong Here": Nice, authoritative CTA.
- Distracting mural, but really cool & artsy tone.
- What Can You Do Here? thingie at the first page
- Describe what you can do
- Symbolic Illustrations would be more effective
- "Just like regular Vimeo, only about a billion times better." = good copy

- Instead of "Try it free" and "Buy it now", just have a "Start your free trial" and offer the upgrade on the app itself.
- Posting hours and time needs to be put there.
- Delineate steps in the process.
- Great job!

## Basecamp
- Friendly face
- Benefits-oriented intro headline, plain English.
- Navigation is there but is out of the way.
- Hard to visualize what the product does.
- Button text is too small to scan.
- Easy to determine if pricing is usage vs. feature vs. user-based.
- Highest price at the top, to anchor the thing
- The first thing to do has to be pre-highlighted.
- Annotation

## Optimizely

#### Home Page
* Extreme color contrast between the sign up form and the upsell.
* Value proposition, "A/B testing you'll actually use", is something that is easily read.
* Informative video on what the product does.
* O doesn't get your personal info. It asks you to take their product for a spin. :)
* Call to action again at the bottom.
* Put the "In the News" at the bottom to boost credibility.
* If you have something good, like the video, or the handwriting, emphasize it.
* Some people might feel that the "stocks going up" image is super generic.
* The CTA at the bottom is different from the CTA at the top (it's "sign up" rather than "test it out").	

#### Pricing
* Additional currency support
* Feature breakdown style: The least features per month is at the left, and features really increase.
* Decide if you want yearly rates or monthly, each has pros and cons.
* Address what happens when the visitors thingie is changed.
* Human phone number, and timing of testimonial.
* CTA could be at the bottom again.

#### Signing Up/Starting Experiment
* Password rules should be shown.
* If handholding, leave an option to decline the handholding.
* Reminders on what they are doing help but only if they are tucked away in a corner.
* When you're nearly done with the free thing to do, that's when the CC is being asked to be taken.
* On plan-picking, better to leave a default plan.
* When clicking the submit button, disable it, tell the people what they are doing, and add the spinner thing.
* Error reporting/wording: How about "We just need to do some stuff..." instead of "...however, we noticed the following..."
* If there is a snippet you have to place on the other person's website,then just put a text area where they can copy the shit. Auto-highlight it too.
* Modals: They should be easily "re-openable".
