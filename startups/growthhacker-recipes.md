## 4: Psycho Time

1. The first time someone visits your site they will be in a neutral state. In a neutral state, people just need one good nudge in the right direction and they'll be willing to do what you want. Since we only want to target first time visitors to the site with this tactic you need to install cookies to track visitors to your site. If it is someone's first visit then it will trigger a drop down bar from the top of the site.

2. Hellobar to build a dropdown thingie. It should appear 3-5 seconds after the page loads.

3. Put offer and time limit on the offer. Time limit should only be an hour or so because we want them to make a snap decision.
