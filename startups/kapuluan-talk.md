It wasn't just corruption, Koera, Malaysia, HK was corrupt. Corruption does not explain economic backwardness. What explains economic backwardness was stupid economic policies.

"inward-looking Filipino first nationalist industrialization"

We put up white elephants that died when globalization set in.

We did not have resources because we did not focus on agricultural improvement.

Our state was so incompetent in providing what our farmers need to be productive.

GMA at least addressed infrastructure (Philippine nautical highway). PNoy is also trying to bring public-private projects of tollways, airports. Unfortunately he has good intentions but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. He has a very weak Dept of Transport/Communications. He has good Dept of Public Works, you can see it in front of you. 

This is one engine of growth, but DOTC is suffering from a disesase called paralysis by analysis. Among the 30 projects of Pres. Aquino, he will be lucky if he gets 5-6 implementd.

If these PPPs would be more than powerpoint presentations, we will be growing by 10-12%.

In 1978-1998, China grew 10%-12% per year. China is now "slowing down" to 7.5%. If we can just create airports, we would be growing not at 7%, but we would be growing at 9%. We hope that the next president will not suffer from paralysis by analysis. And we need that to fight poverty. Growth in itself does not trickle down, but for us to fight poverty, it is indispensible, it is not sufficient, but it is important.

Root evil of neglecting the farmers and infrastructure. Even things such as rice being dried in the cemented road, I'm ashamed. About 30% of the palay goes to waste when doing that. This is because government in Thailand/Vietnam prioritize the infrastructure.

Because we are seeing money flowing to the countryside (no thanks to investment, but because of the overseas remittances), those changes benefit your generation.

Why is manufacturing going to experience a renaissance? The director of the PEZA zone, Lila (not Leila) de Lima, completely incorrupt. Every time she comes back from Japan, she says "I cannot cope with the requests of the Japanese businessmen when they want to transfer their factories to the Philippines." This is because of the shutdown of nuclear power plants, and the problem between the Japanese/Chinese. Expect the coming of the Japanese (and of course the Koreans) to the factory zones in 5-10 years. The whole of Korea is investing a significant part of their GDP in R&D.

Korea is the country that developing countries should emulate. If there is one country you young people should study or visit, this is the country. Korea went to first-world status because of investment in education. A lot of Koreans also took PhD in U.S. and went back. (The same with Indians, they are now in India putting up companies.) We're not yet there, but there in the next 10 years, we could introduce high tech engineering in the Philippines.

Sorry to say but with 25% of the population living in dehumanizing conditions, we have to prioritize practical research/agriculture. Theoretical, you want to hone abroad, in Germany or Japan or Korea.

What are the engines of growth that explained the 7.2% growth last year and how can we get 7-9% for the next x years?

1. 25 billion dollars of remittances from Filipino workers. That is not going to disappear. When the global recession happened, our remittances increased by 6-7%. Why am I so sure that 10M workers will continue sending? Because Filipinos are first to be fired and last to be hired.

2. Second engine of growth: Business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing. This is a sustainable industry. Expect the Philippines will continue to lead in BPO. We should not be complacent though because there are English training centers in China. But prepare to move up the value chain: Accenture, Indra, McKinsey and other foreign companies go here already.

  We need people to go into the SME sector, because these people drive the economy, not the big companies but the bult of the SME.

Polls say that Binay would be elected to be president. But anyway 2 1/2 years are enough for a dark horse. Anyway, I don't have proof if he took money or something, but I'm not worried. Just read "Why Nations Fail", and the answer is institution. You create institutions that go beyond the life of the leaders, and you introduce success.

#### Positive trends;

- Stable democracy
- Impriving governance
- Strong macroeconomic fundamentals
- Labor peace
- Educated, young, and English speaking labor force
- Strategic geographic location: launching pad for AEC
- Renaissance of manufacturing
- High rate of savings due to OFW remittances
- Low rate of dependence on petroleum
- One of the best performing stock markets in the world
- One of the emerging markets

To screw things up, we can go back to traditional and protectionist stuff. It's a fallacy to say Filipino first for "patriotism". If we go back to Filipino first, it's more of rich Filipinos first.
