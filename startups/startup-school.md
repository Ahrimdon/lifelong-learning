# Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School 2013

_First code ever?_ I tried to build a lot of stuff that I wanted, not for anyone else. And when I got to college, I wanted to build something that would connect with other people around me. Example is Coursegraph, which I wanted to find out what classes to take. So I learned how to set up Apache and MySQL. My theory at the time was that people were really missing from the Internet. We just want the platforms to be more human.

At that time I wasn’t sure that was going to work, but I wanted to make people combine their ideas to create a shared resource. Ex: the art class thing.

_Why did Facebook fight (and win) with the competing services in other colleges?_ You can’t just create a web crawler to find personal information, you have to make a tool so people can upload themselves. None of them had friending people (you can just say that you were connected to people) and they didn’t have that much personalization. It also tied your identity, which is different from traditional anonymous Internet communication.

The only thing I got from Facesmash was that I met my wife there. But I don’t think a Facebook would have started from the college. I was excited to create Facebook for the community, but I thought that a big company that was going to do it. In fact all reason says that big companies should do it because there’s just more resources there, but we loved the project more.

Early on skeptics thought it seemed like a bad idea, and most good things start as bad ideas. This is something that translates to Internet.org, we want to get the next 1/7th of the world on the Internet. I also think that the best stuff that gets built seems irrational at the time.

So many things go wrong when you’re starting a company  and don’t even bother trying to avoid mistakes because you will make mistakes. Every single year there was something that could have killed FB.

I think we had a ton of shitstorm because I knew nothing about business at all. When I went here with Dustin and I thought maybe I’d start a company (not Facebook). When Thiel came to invest, he demanded that the founders would be on vesting schedules, but I don’t know what it was.

I learned how to manage and hire people by making a ton of mistakes. I’ve developed some heuristics: *the only way to know if someone is good is that if you’d work for the people you’d hire.* Now I just threw myself to that stuff and I just spoke at conferences without actually preparing to desensitize me to failure.

Managing people is good if you work with people you like. If you can set up a team dynamic where you’re constantly learning from this person, then that’s good, because most smart people like learning.

There’s this culture in SV that makes startups seem glamorous, when it’s not. We just want to get out of the part where I was dying.

The idea that there should be some social platform was there, early on. People want to learn about people, that’s a core thing in our psychology. There needed to be a common framework that we can develop around.

Thiel was really focused with network effects, and as you build the company you have to focus on one or two things per day (out of the hundred things that come). Ex: we wanted people to add as many friends as possible. 

Another ex: we want to expand to schools which had an intense social connection with Harvard, too. Then another company named collegefacebook started in schools we weren’t at. When we feel that a competitor was getting ahead of us, we would “lockdown” and not even leave the house until we addressed the problem.

We can’t get to some countries such as Russia, because their hacker team is so good and they have illegal file downloads.

Clones are a big nuisance. But you do want to internationalize fairly early. 

I’m too obsessed with connecting people, I believe that when you connect people they can do cool things and I think this is the right thing to do.
 
# Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School 2012

We needed the school-specific emails to verify authenticity.

People basically double the data they shared online every few years.

While we wanted to make a general service, we had a long debate about parsing the course schedules. We had the courses far long than necessary.

You can’t 80-20 everything, you have to be better than the competition at some point.

First we had a constraint of $85/month servers. The fact that we go college by college and we had to make small things work was very key. Facebook didn’t grow quickly, it took a year to get 1 million users.

We went to Columbia, Stanford, and Yale because they had existing networks so we felt that if we can beat that, then we could probably win. So we knew that people in those schools wanted to use something like this.

We can look at the amount of sharing and say that “okay, there’s enough sharing that we can support this kind of service”. Wikipedia was earlier because it was easier to share external information rather than yourself.

We really listen to what users wanted, both qualitatively (feedback) and quantitatively (data). A lot of people would upload profile pictures everyday. We couldn’t add this feature until we actually had engineering build this service with servers.

I actually loved classics in high school and I was a psychology major. I took more computer science courses rather than psychology though. Maybe I would have gone to Microsoft.

I didn’t necessarily want to start startups but so much of the lessons I learned was that it’s really hard to decide to start a company. It’s more of “I want to build this” and I never understood the psychology of “I want to start a company”.

I have this fear of doing things that I’m not doing something impactful. I think having the flexibility of being in college is something that is taken for granted. Explore what you want to do before committing. Keep yourself flexible, you have to be wary about starting a company.

I think the feature that makes people come back to Facebook is the fact that we’re hardwired to focus on people. I don’t see chairs and the room, I see faces. Most humans dream about social interactions, but there wasn’t any service online before Facebook.

Since personal information wasn’t indexed by search engines, the service has to be created.

I think technology extends human’s capacity to do things. Glasses extend your seeing capacity. Steve Jobs said that computers are bicycles for the mind. Social networks extend your social capacity.

I think it’s not about winning vs. losing (Facebook vs. Myspace) and Myspace was a better service early on for meeting new people. Facebook was more of for maintaining connections with people you knew. I think they were threatened by us and they tried to copy us, so it was doomed.

The actual thought was that we wanted to be around the companies so we can figure out what to do with a new company.
 
# Nate Blecharczyk (AirBnb) at Startup School 2013

You want your company to have hockey stick. It took us 4 years to serve 4 million guests, but in the last 9 months we have 5 million guests.

You need to get confidence because you’ll fail more times than you succeed.

Every experience you have should be adding to the eventual pinnacle of success.

The worst thing was to find people who aren’t as hardworking as you.

You have to choose really good partners because you cannot change partners as easily as you can change your ideas.

Airbnb = air bed and breakfast. This was because of the lack of hotels for the design conference.

First version: No payment, just a search engine for people who might want to do it. Wanted to create this just in time for SXSW.

We handled the payments because so it is just focused on the hospitality. Motto: 3 clicks to book it.

Justin.tv’s CEO was asking for the features and they were slow because Nate was doing something with his life.

Then when they tried to pitch, an angel just stood up and went out.

One time, they changed the slide from 200M expected money to 2.1B lol.

Financial crisis, they put the chart on the needed figures to get to ramen profitability.

Find the few users they loved you, not the 1K that sort of like you. We did this by manually meeting the users and manually improving their profiles.

# [Joe Gebbia: The Airbnb Story](http://vimeo.com/23275754)

We (Bryan and Joe) have something in common: we wanted to be entrepreneurs.

When we couldn't afford our rental for that month, but there was a design conference that was so big that all the hotels were full. So what if, if we can blow up an air mattress, blow it up, and rent them to designers for this conference. By the end of the night, Air Bread and Breakfast.

How do we get people to know about it. No Craigslist, we want to know who was staying over. 24 hours later, it was real!

Next version: South by Southwest in Austin. 2 weeks to do it. Well we discovered: It was awkward to exchange money. Better to just do credit cards!

Next, online transactions. But how to market? They timed it on the Democratic National Convention. Good press, good spike, but nothing after.

They then created the Obama O's and Capn McCains. They sold 500 of each, at $40 each, and that funded the startup. Then they applied to Y Combinator and for the next three months, planned on how to get ramen profitability.

Then we met our users individually. Now you can book a lot of stuff: Treehouses, castles, boats, cars, co-working spaces, art galleries, tents.






# Jack Dorsey at Startup School 2013

The Art Spirit: Robert Henri. Art is simply a question of doing anything well. When the artist is alive in any kind of person, he becomes a self-expression people. He disturbs, upsets, enlightens, and opens up ways to better understanding.

# Ashton Kutcher at Startup School 2011

I quit the one thing that was sure-fire and became a model, and got bored really fast, and now I'm back at technology again. I started getting interested solving problems: my own problems, and other people's problems. I think that's the single biggest thing I look for in ents, they genuinely want to solve problems, first their own, and then others.

Carl Fisher, as a kid can't see very well. He quit school as a kid. Bike store -> car shop -> headlights -> car racing -> Miami Beach -> Montauk -> stock market crash, loses everything. It wasn't about the money, but it was about uncovering and disrupting markets boldly to leave everything behind for everyone to use.
