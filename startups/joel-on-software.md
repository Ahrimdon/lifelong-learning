## [The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)

1. __Do you use source control?__
2. __Can you make a build in one step?__ More steps = more errors
3. __Do you make daily builds?__ Breaking builds are so common that we want a pre-build always, so you can fix it anyway.
4. __Do you have a bug database?__ A minimal useful bug database must include the following data for every bug:

	- complete steps to reproduce the bug
	- expected behavior
	- observed (buggy) behavior
	- who it's assigned to
	- whether it has been fixed or not

5. __Do you fix bugs before writing new code?__ Easier to fix bugs that you just got than a few months down the line. Also better for fighting competition.
6. __Do you have an up-to-date schedule?__
7. __Do you have a spec?__ Code with no spec behind it usually sucks.
8. __Do programmers have quiet working conditions?__ It's ridiculously easy to break flow in a programmer.
9. __Do you use the best tools money can buy?__ Long compile time = distractions. Small monitor = sucks for debugging GUI code. Image manipulation program needed for modifying pix etc.
10. __Do you have testers?__ Testers are too cheap to skimp on.
11. __Do new candidates write code during their interview?__
12. __Do you do hallway usability testing?__
