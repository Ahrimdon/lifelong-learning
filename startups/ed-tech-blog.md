## [My Experience in the Educational Apps Market - 2013 report](http://blog.lescapadou.com/2013/12/my-experience-in-education-apps-market.html?hn)

Full-time French indie dev with 2 daughters, started in 2010. He has a lot of educ materials at home, mostly Montessori.

Cumulative sales since 2010: beyond $1.1M. Montessori Crosswrods, Word Wizard. Sales increased 5-10% per year even with 2 apps only in 2011.

1 quality app per year is better. Fear was competition would kill him, but actually, the market is big enough and a lot of people, including Apple, helps to spread the word about good indie apps.

The best sellers are still MC and WW. If you've got an app that peopel love and a good user base, it's a recipe for success. But still, update the apps. Lower sales for MC because unupdated.

Bulk educ purchases = awesome. And US market (52% sales) is important. Localizations are worth it because compared to creating a new app, it doesn't take a lot of time and money to localize. Math is easier to localize too.

So many good apps are available for schools. This means that if your app is bought, your app is really good. No discounts for volume purchases because $3 is really cheap. Discounts only for more expensive apps.

2013: He entered a crowded market: apps that help kids to trace letters. He analyzed the market and saw that no apps do everything well. He released Writing Wizard and was featured on the US/AUS/UK App store in the educ category. Reviews were really great, too.

When the app was no longer featured, sales began to decrease. Then he set the app for free for 1-2 days with MomsWithApps AppFriday, and he contacted all the bloggers he knew. In mid-Sept there was 60K free DLs in 2 days. So the app was put in the top 30 paid education.

Android sales are not very good compared to iOS. Most people report that iOS sales are 5 times better, and it's almost the same for me. I receive more and more mails from people asking me if my app are on Android. So it surely means that the Android educational market will continue to grow, but I don't have enough time to port my Android apps. I should use a cross-platform framework (e.g. Unity) for my next app so I can release easily on several platforms.

He tested $4.99, revenue was a little bit better at the beginning, but after one month sales were lower. Endless Alphabet: Pricing. Free for several months, then move to $4.99. Much user base when it was in free, that they were directly into the top 10 paid educ. Another interesting company is Motion Math which try several models : free+ IAP, paid + IAP to get more levels, and pro versions without IAP for schools. 

Not too excited about subscription model.

How to get app featured in App Store? There is an editorial team who chooses apps they like. So the idea is just to let them know that your app exists. If you've got a contact at Apple, it's easier of course. But I imagine that they also regularly check blogs to know what's going on - so do your marketing and you will see if you did release a good app...
