## [My Experience in the Educational Apps Market - 2013 report](http://blog.lescapadou.com/2013/12/my-experience-in-education-apps-market.html?hn)

I'm a full-time French indie dev, and I started creating apps in 2010 when the iPad was released. I have 2 adorable daughters who are homeschooled, and it was clear that the iPad was going to be successful with my kids, even if - as most of us - I didn't think that the market would grow that way. We've got a lot of educational materials at home, mostly Montessori, and I usually get my ideas from these materials and then add all the magic that touch devices can add to enhance these materials. 

So cumulative sales since 2010 are beyond $1.1M. Amazing. I really didn't think sales could be so nice when I released Montessori Crosswords in 2010. Since I released Word Wizard in August 2011, sales have increased about 5-10% per year although I only had 2 apps in 2011 (plus 2 French localizations), and a lot more now (4 apps in English and a lot of localized apps).

The good news is that releasing one quality app per year, some updates and localizations allows to keep and even increase a little bit my revenue. I always feared that the competition (especially big players and funded startups) would "eat" the market. I think that it is partially true, but some facts are helping me: the market is bigger and bigger, and a lot of people - including Apple when it features indie apps devs - help to spread the word about good indie apps. In addition, I've got a very good user base who love my apps and recommends them.

It's interesting to see that my first 2 apps (Montessori Crosswords and Word Wizard) are still the best sellers. Still the same conclusion as last year: if you've got an app that people love and a good user base, it's a recipe for success. But don't forget to update your apps so that they stay alive. For example, Montessori Crosswords has not been updated since more than 1 year and I believe it is partially why sales are going down. I don't know exactly why Montessori Numbers has not performed better. My new app, Writing Wizard, has been very well received and I think it will be my best seller next year. 

I've got a lot of bulk education purchases  so if you check the rank of my apps in 2013 you may not have a correct relation between revenue and rank, because educational purchases are not taken into account for the rank of the app. 

When you see these numbers, you understand why the US market is so important (52% of sales, and with other English-speaking  countries, it represents 70% of sales). Localizations, especially in France and Sweden, were worth the efforts especially because, compared to creating a new app, it does not take a lot of time and money to localize an app. Note that I don't mean it's trivial to do a localization - localization of educational apps are usually not trivial especially for apps helping kids to learn how to read or write (Math is more universal and easier to localize - I should do more Math appsâ€¦) 

Another interesting figure is the last column that represents the educational purchases made by schools. It is just a little bit better than in 2011, but I believe this market is really bigger this year. However, it is the same as in the "parents" market : so many more good apps are available now. Anyway, I really like these purchases because it means that my apps are good educational apps. Note that I don't do discounts for volume purchases (except if somebody asked to do it because they don't have enough budget) because I think 3$ is really cheap. I believe the discount exists for more expensive apps.

I release one polished app every year, and in 2013 I decided to enter a very crowded market : apps that help kids to trace letters. The tracing feature I've added to Montessori Numbers for Christmas 2012 was very well received - people were happy and Apple featured the update - so I decided to do an app based on the same tracing engine with new fun features. After analyzing the market, I found that there was no apps that do everything well. Some apps were very nice and fun (e.g. LetterSchool) but lacked from settings to customize the app to suit every child's needs  as well as reporting features which are important for parents and teachers. Some apps did have more features but were not fun enough to keep kids motivated.

After 6 month of hard work and many many tests with kids, Writing Wizard was released early August and was featured on the US/AUS/UK App Store in the Education category. Reviews were really great - I think it is the best reviews I've got for an app. 

However, sales were good but not fantastic at launch - maybe owing to the fact that a lot of people already have tracing apps and it is more difficult to sell this kind of app, or because it was released too early. As usual, as soon as the app was no longer featured (or less visible), sales began to decrease. Everybody was loving the app and I knew that all I needed was to spread the word a little more. So I decided to set the app free for 1 or 2 days with the help of MomsWithApps AppFriday. I also contacted all bloggers I know, and mid-September  there was 60K free downloads in 2 days which pushed the app in the top 30 paid education in the following weeks as you can see in the graph below.

You see the spikes in the graph ? It is educational purchases made by schools... So, again, don't make easy correlation between rank and sales because educational purchases are not taken into account for the ranking.

 I have localized Word Wizard in Dutch and Montessori Numbers in Swedish. It usually took one week and a little bit of money to localize an app. It is usually profitable but the problem is always the same: visibility. It is not easy to market an app in a language you don't speak. Dutch Word Wizard was featured in the Dutch App Store and sales were pretty good but now it only sells a few units a day. It is the same issue than in the German market (I did the German localization last year). If you don't have a very good user base or do very good marketing, it is difficult to enter a local market (in addition it is difficult to evaluate the quality of the app even if you ask native people to test it). Swedish Word Wizard sells very well and so I believed it was a good thing to localize the numbers app in Swedish (especially because there are also people who help localize the app for free and a blog, pappasappar.se, that helps spread the word about good apps for kids). It is not a big hit but it is profitable.

Android sales are not very good compared to iOS. Most people report that iOS sales are 5 times better, and it's almost the same for me. 

I receive more and more mails from people asking me if my app are on Android. So it surely means that the Android educational market will continue to grow, but I don't have enough time to port my Android apps. I should use a cross-platform framework (e.g. Unity) for my next app so I can release easily on several platforms.

All my apps are $2.99. It seems the sweet spot for me. I tried to raise the price of Word Wizard to $4.99 for 2 months. Revenue were a little bit better at the beginning but after one month sales were lower, and I set the price back to $2.99. Perhaps I should try $3.99...

An interesting experience was how Originator's Endless Alphabet was marketed. It was all about pricing. They released this excellent app as a free app for several months, then moved to $4.99 (or more, it is now $5.99). This way, they did get a huge user base and when they moved to paid, they were directly in the top 10 paid education. 

Another interesting company is Motion Math which try several models : free+ IAP, paid + IAP to get more levels, and pro versions without IAP for schools. 

Some apps (Reading Rainbow, Agnitus) that are performing well are using a subscription model (user pay every month automatically). However I personally don't really like this model even if it seems very profitable. It looks OK if you add contents every month but it is not the case for all these apps as far as I know. 

A lot of people have questions about how an app is being featured on the App Store. I believe the answer is simply that there is an editorial team who choose apps they like. So the idea is just to let them know that your app exists. If you've got a contact at Apple, it's easier of course. But I imagine that they also regularly check blogs to know what's going on - so do your marketing and you will see if you did release a good app...
