Preface -- The Hero's Journey
=============================

Hero's journey = like startups. All new companies have a mythological vision of what it should be. Founding biz want to prove that their vision and business is real and not some hallucination.

Startups that survive the first few tough years do not follow the traditional product-centric launch model. The winners invent and live by a process of cx learning and discovery.

Introduction -- Winners and Losers
==================================

90% of startups fail before they launch their new products. Products developed with senior management out in front of cx win early and win often. Products handed off to a sales and marketing organisation lose.

The challenge of understanding cx and finding a market is the same for a large company as for a startup.

Chapter 1: The Path to Disaster: The Product Development Model
==============================================================

Webvan (online shopping) was believed to be a "killer app" for the Internet. They raised 800M in funding.

The Product Development Diagram
-------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Concept/Seed -> Product Development -> Alpha/Beta Test -> Launch/1st Ship*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Concept/Seed: Founders turn their passion and vision int oa set of key ideas.
	* Can the product be built?
	* Who are the potential cx?
	* How will the product reach the cx?
	* Basic assumptions about pricing.
	* Webvan did this well, it had a good story and a founder with a good track record.

* Product Development: Make the thing
	* Eng'g: Build, specify the first release, and hire staff to build a product.
	* Marketing: Refine the size of the market defined, run an FGD or something.
	* Webvan built automated warehouses and conveyors to transport the materials, made their own sales/inventory/warehouse management system. To build cx loyalty, they did public relations programs, advertising campaigns, and promotional activities.

* Alpha/Beta Test
	* Eng'g works with a small group of outside users to make sure that the product works as speficied and tests it for bugs.
	* Sales: Beta customers, builds the distribution channel, staffs and scales the sales organisation
	* Webvan: 1100 beta testers. PR blitz across hundreds of articles.

* Product Launch and First Cx Ship
	* The company goes into "big bang" spending mode.
	* Sales is heavily building and staffing a sales org, sales channel has quotas and sales goals.
	* Marketing is at its peak.
	* Webvan: Raised $400M and had market capitalisation of $8.5B.

What's Wrong with this Picture?
-------------------------------

*Where are the cx?* 

The greatest risk in startups is not the development of risk but in the development of cx. Startups don't fail because they lack a product, they fail because they lack cx and a proven financial model.

*The Focus on First Cx Ship Date*

Using the Product Development model forces sales and marketing to focus on the first cx ship date. They think that things are finished after the first ship date. Everybody wants to do things before the ship date. Don't follow the "get the product to market" advice. You have to understand why you are selling a product and if people will buy it.

All the great startups focus on the cx. Sales must find not just beta cx, but those representative of the mainstream market. Webvan, instead of finding cx, scaled unnecessarily, hiring 500 more employees.

*An Emphasis on Execution Instead of Learning and Discovery*

Before selling a product, ask yourself, what is the problem that your startup is going to solve? Are those problems something that cx views as "must-have"? If we're selling to biz, who in the company haas a problem that they want to solve? Who else has to approve the purchase? The answer is not "I know already."

*The Lack of Meaning Milestones for Sales, Marketing, and Biz Dev't*

You think that revenue matters. You think that the right sales team matters. You think that you need celebrities as customers. You think a corporate presentation, collateral, and data sheets matters. You think a PR agency and buzz matters.

None of these are true objectives. A startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of cx and their problems, discovering a repeatable road map, and building a financial model that results in profitability.

Webvan had no milestones that said stop and evaluate the results. In its rush to execution, it kept right over learning and discovery.

*The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Sales*

The half-life of a startup VP of sales is about nine months, because they always assume "build the product and the cx will come."

*The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Marketing

Old strategy: Feed the sales pipeline with sales prospects, create marketing activities at the first stage of the process. Marketing also hires a public relations agency to help the company understand and influence key industry analysts, luminaries, and references.

This looks smart, except that all of this occurs before the cx actually buys shit. The process needs to involve the cx at all times. Webvan: It had 47K cx, but 71% of the sales were from the old cx, no growth involved.

*Premature Scaling*

Startup execs need 3 documents to guide their hiring and staffing: a biz plan, a product dev't model, and a revenue forecast. There are no milestones that say "stop or slow hiring until you understand cx." Problem with Webvan: spent 18M to develop proprietary software and 40M to set up its first automated warehouse before it had shipped a single item. Their biz model only made sense at a very high volume predicted on the spreadsheet.

*Death Spiral: The Cost of Getting Product Launch Wrong*

Premature scaling causes the burn rate to accelerate. When there's a problem, they fire the VP sales for having no sales.

*Not all Startups are ALike

Startups either

* Bring a new product into an existing market
* Bring a new product into a new market
* Bring a new product into an existing market and try to resegment that market as a low-cost entrant
* Bring a new product into the market and try to resegment that market as a niche entrant. Ex: In-N-Out offered three, fresh, high quality burgers.

Webvan had an unproven business model.

Alternative: The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve
-----------------------------------------------------

* Technology is adopted in phases approach by distinct groups.
* Tech enthusiasts/visionaries are the early market. Pragmatists and conservatives are the late market.
* Chasm between early market and mainstream market.

The problem with bridging the chasm is that the marketing and selling lessons of the initial market cannot be transferred to the mainstream market.

Oftentimes, tech enthusiasts do not buy anything. As a startup, focusing on execution will kill you. You have to focus on cx learning and discovery.

Chapter 2 -- The Path to Epiphany : The Customer Development Model
==================================================================

Furniture biz: Furniture.com and Living.com flamed out, but Design Within Reach wanted to solve the problem of waiting for months get designer stuff. He said that the current B2B market for furnishing was archaic and cx had to wait for four months for product and incurred unnecessary markups of up to 40%. Investors hated it because there was no website and no e-commerce.


Customer Development Model

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Customer Discovery <-> Customer Validation -> Customer Creation -> Company Building*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike product dev, finding the right cx is unpredictable, and we will screw things up before we get it right. Cx validation: A key checkpoint in understanding whether you have a product that cx want to buy and a road map of how to sell it.

Step 1: Cx Discovery
--------------------

You want to see if the problem, product, and cx hypotheses are correct. The goal is to see whether there are customers and a market for them. Rob (Design Within Reach) constantly listened to suppliers and customers.

Step 2: Cx Validation
---------------------

Test the perceived value of your product: DWR's hypothesis was that its cx fit a narrow profile of design professionals. It treated this idea like the educated guess it was, and tested this premise by analysing the sales results of each catalog.

Step 3: Cx Creation
-------------------

Goal: Create end-user demand and drive that demand into the company's sales channel. Furniture and Living: spammed Amazon's front page and PR campaigns. This is unfocused and cx don't have a clue on what you are talking about.

Step 4: Company Building
------------------------

Build shit with VP Sales, VP Marketing, VP Biz Dev. Premature scaling is the bane of startups. DWR: Burn rate was low, first with angel funding, then using a sales road map that could scale.

Synchronizing Product Dev and Customer Dev
------------------------------------------

When talking with cx, the VP for product dev goes out in front of the cx to listen to cx feedback. Cx validation: Key members of prod dev team go out too.

Step-by-Step Customer Discovery
===============================

State Your Hypothesis
* Product Hypothesis
* Cx/Problem Hypothesis
* Distribution & Pricing Hypothesis
* Demand Creation Hypothesis
* Market Type Hypothesis
* Competitive Hypothesis

Problem Hypothesis
* Friendly First Contacts
* "Problem" Presentation
* Cx Understanding
* Market Knowledge

Test Product Hypothesis
* First Reality Check
* "Product" Presentation
* More Cx Visits
* Second Reality Check
* 1st Advisory Board

Verify
* Verify the Problem
* Verify the Product
* Verify the Biz Model
* Iterate or Exit

Chapter 3 -- Customer Discovery
===============================

FastOffice - brilliant product, but too expensive. Lack of cx discovery/"what price are you willing to pay for it". They developed a great product without spending an equivalent time studying the market.

What they did was they changed to attempt to sell to the Fortune 1000 companies for people who work at home. Their new product was supposed to make a single salesperson appear like a large office. Problem was that it was not a compelling problem to solve.

Cx Discovery Philosophy
-----------------------

*What you are NOT going to do:*
* Understand the needs and wants of ALL cx
* Make a list of ALL features a cx want before they buy your product
* Hand Product Dev a features list of the sum of all cx requests
* Hand Product Dev a detailed marketing requirements doc
* Run focus groups and test cx' reactions to your product to see if they will buy

Instead, you will develop a product for the few, not the many. You are going to start building your product even before you know whether you have any cx for it.

Earlyvangelists: The Most Important Cx You'll Ever Know
-------------------------------------------------------

They are a special breed of cx willing to take a risk on your startup's product and service because they can actually envision its potential to solve a critical and immediate problem (and they have the budget to purchase it).

A good cx: has visualized what the product should do, and how much value it will add or how much costs it will save. "Boy, if I could find someone who solves this, then I would pay that guy."

Characteristics of earlyvangelists
* Has a problem
* Is aware of having a problem
* Has been actively looking for a solution
* Has put together a solution out of piece parts
* Has or can acquire a budget

Perfect candidates: Have at least a solution to this which they do by themselves.

Start Development Based on Vision
---------------------------------

What you can do is to put product dev on hold until the cx dev team can find the cues. Always better to have the cx dev team get the company's customer knowledge to catch up on the pace of the product dev team.

A startup's first release has to be good enough for the first paying customers. The purpose of cx discovery is to identify those key visionary cx, understand their needs, and verify that your product solves a problem that they are willing to pay to have solved.

Cx Discover Process

*State hypothesis -> Test problem hypothesis -> Test product concept -> Verify*
