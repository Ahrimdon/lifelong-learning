## Shimano Road Groupsets: The Hierarchy
[link](http://www.evanscycles.com/coffeestop/advice/shimano-road-groupsets-the-hierarchy/)

- More expensive components mean less weight, easier shifting, greater comfort.
- Groupset: chainset, cassette, shifters, chain, derailleurs.
- Manufacturers: Shimano, SRAM, Campagnalo
- *Front gears: Shifting between front gears makes for the greatest change in effort and speed.* The more teeth in the chainset, the higher the resistance, and the harder a pedal stroke will be.
- Standard double: 50/39. Compact: 50/34. Newest: 52/36. Triple: 50/39/30.
- *Rear gears: Fine tuning resistance.* 8, 9, 10, 11 speed. Wider ratio means more choices. 11-32 means more gears for tackling hills, but the jump will be much greater. 11-23 won't have so many get out of jail gears for steep hills, but the shifting will be very smooth as the number of teeth goes up in smaller increments.

#### The Shimano Hiearchy

- Claris: Entry level, 8 speed.
- Sora: 9 speed with dual control. This can have a compact or triple chainring.
- Tiagra: 8, 9, 10 speed and is available in double, triple, and compact options.
- 105: The most affordable or road groupsets not classified as entry level--difference from Tiagra is quicker shifting and stiffer crankset. Doesn't show which gear you are in.
- Ultegra: Crisp shift, stiff cranks on the chainset, prompt braking that bites the wheel rim. Ultegra is lighter, and a shorter stroke at the level makes shifting more effortless. Ultegra is vailable with Di2 shifting.
- Dura Ace: Used by professional racers.
