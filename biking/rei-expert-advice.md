## Climbing Hills on Your Bike: How to
[link](http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/climb-hills.html)

- Climbing hills on a road bike is different than doing so on a mountain bike. The main difference involves the presence or absence of traction.
- Assuming you have traction, climbing on a road bike is a matter of getting the most power for the energy you spend. The gut reaction of any beginning cyclist is to stand in the pedals and drive each pedal forward stroke after stroke until the crest of the hill is reached or the cyclist collapses from exhaustion.
- *When possible, keep your rear end on the seat and keep your cadence high. This assures a maximum transfer of your energy into power. If you need more power, drive your rear end to the back of your seat as you push on the downstroke. Also, len forward. Keep your elbows flexed but pull on the side of the handlebar opposite from your downstroke.*
- If you must stand, don't move your body, move your bike. As you begin the downward stroke, lean the bike away from the foot delivering the stroke. Keep your body in a straight line over the weighted foot. Lean forward on the handlebars to deliver even more power, but keep your elbows loose. As the weighted foot finishes its stroke, transfer your weight to the other foot. Use the bike as a lever to help pull your weight over to the other foot.
- Mental: Most professional cyclists do this by focusing on minutiae. Professional cyclists take the hill in chunks and insert a dialogue regarding this aspect of the climb. "All I have to do is make it to that rock up there. Good! Now if I can make it to that mile marker." Then picture yourself making it to the top. The important thing is not to bite off too big a chunk of ground to cover. When you make it to each marker, compliment yourself like you've just won the Tour.

#### Climb Hills on a Mountain Bike

- On a road bike, traction is only a problem when the weather turns bad. On a mountain bike, the traction is almost always bad. Loose rocks, roots, mud, and sand can all cause a rather tame hill to become something of a monster.
- *Slide your rear end back on your seat.* To prevent yourself from doing a wheelie, keep your weight on the front wheel by leaning your torso forward as you move your rear end back. Bend at the hips, keep your elbows close to the side and flexible, and keep your head up.
- Though it's awkward, you can have your chin right above your handlebar, your back flat, and your rear end sticking up in the air.
- Go into a gear that's low enough that you're neither spinning rapidly nor having to stand on the pedals to crank them forward. Then, keep your cadence steady and smooth.
- *For a beginner, the tendency is to shift before you actually start climbing the hill. But as your learn to move your weight fore and aft to maintain balance and traction, you can modify your shifting to maintain speed.*
- Once you feel more comfortable climbing, maintain your cadence on your current gear until you feel like you're about to life out of the saddle to continue pedaling. At this point, shift into a lower gear.
