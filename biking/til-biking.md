## First Ride to Angeles (Sept 6 2015)

- Heat stroke is a bitch!
- You need more exercise and practice in biking/weaving through traffic.
- In general, jeepneys have weird habits (random swerving/stopping) so adjust accordingly.
- The rear derailleur is the most important and most vulnerable part of the bike.
- When putting the bike in bus, cover the RD with your helmet.
- Even without a full fold, you can put your bike at the back of your car.
- You need disciplined shifting. Ideally, you should have the same cadence the entirety of your ride.
- Figure out a way to insulate your water from the heat. Possibly put ice in there so it lasts longer.
- No need to carry a rain jacket. If it rains, then you get wet.
- Apply petroleum jelly liberally to your butt, it will get sore at some point.
- Try to hydrate before you even get on the bike.
- You need to acclimatize yourself when it comes to riding in the heat. If you aren't used to those temperatures, it will affect you and make it harder than for someone who is used to it.
- Replaced rear brake pads: 30 for the 2 pads (generic), 20 for the labor

## Random

- Put things you hold on your left hand
- Tune up @Iron Bike costs 100

## First Ride to UP/Office

- Kalayaan from Cubao is a long-ass uphill
- Prepare for hills by downshifting prematurely
- Increase height of seat (you should be able to stand over your bike just barely)
- Hard to breathe with a mask
- Camelbak Eddy is too big for the Topeak
- Don't wear boots if raining, wear slippers. :)

## House-Ortigas-White Plains-House

- Need to learn how to use a bike pump
- Now it makes sense why people have GPS on when you get lost
- Temple Drive is uphill
- EDSA bike lane is nice and there is nothing to fear but just bring a mouth mask for the pollution
- Don't use bikes if wheels are flat since the spokes can go
- Nearest bike shop is Glorious in Anonas
- Schwalbe Marathon tires to replace my tires
- The Anemos front fork folder jams
- It's really hard to bike up when you have a full backpack
- Always bring food, you were forced to do a Kowloon stop
