- Need to learn how to use a bike pump
- Now it makes sense why people have GPS on when you get lost
- Temple Drive is uphill
- EDSA bike lane is nice and there is nothing to fear but just bring a mouth mask for the pollution
- Don't use bikes if wheels are flat since the spokes can go
- Nearest bike shop is Glorious in Anonas
- Schwalbe Marathon tires to replace my tires
- The Anemos front fork folder jams
- It's really hard to bike up when you have a full backpack
- Always bring food, you were forced to do a Kowloon stop
