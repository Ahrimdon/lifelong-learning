## Nutrition for Cycling: Fueling Your Human Powered Vehicle

- Everyday nutrition vs ride-day nutrition. In the saddle you have high calorie needs based on METS (metabolic equivalents), you might need 12-13 up to 18 times the calories you need on the bike as opposed to off the bike.
- 60% carb, 20% pro, 20% fat normal day, on race day needs change. When you are doing aerobic activity, it prefers to use carbs as fuel. Proteins and fats are hard to use as fuel.
- You want to distribute your calories throughout your day. This is the healthy way to lose/maintain/gain weight. Body would rather not go into a feast-and-famine scenario because we are good in hoarding calories.
- People normally have no idea of what their calories/carb/protein/fat numbers are (and people who know their numbers aren't really different).
- Aero bikes and gear would probably save 6 minutes in a 40km time trial, but being fit would probably save 12 minutes.

#### Hydration

- Everyday hydration is very important. Being in a deficit for a day would carry over to the next day.
- Good for: tissue perfusion, blood pressure, mental abilities, appetite regulation, and our brains float in water.
- 2% loss in body mass due to loss in water = 5% loss in performance (quantitatively and qualitatively).
- *Everyday fluid (including coffee, tea, soup) needs: kg * 30-35 ml/kg = __ ml per day (159 lbs = 3300 ml)*
- On the Bike:
  - Weight: pre ride - post ride = --kg * 16 oz (1oz = 30ml)
  - Fluid consumed during ride = --oz
  - Total oz (A+B)/hours of ride = oz/hr
- Hydration needs change depending on temperature/elevation acclimatization, pre-ride hydration status and exertion
- Schedule
  - 1-2 hours before: 16-20oz fluid
  - 30 min before: 8-16oz fluid
  - Sip something every 15 min: 4-8 oz
  - Within 1 hr after ride: 16-24 oz
  - Over an hour: Add carb to water (Gatorade, juice)

#### How to Hydrate

- 4-6x per hour
- >60 min ride, sports drinks replace electrolyte losses, enhance fluid absorption, makes it easier to access carbs, flavor burnout
- Drinking while pedaling, climbing along vs peloton,
- 0-3 hours: Different carbs, some sodium, some potassium, other electrolytes
- Above 3 hours,
