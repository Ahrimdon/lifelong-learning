## The Psychology of Cycling

- The goal is not peak performance, but prime cycling
- Riding at a consistently high level under the most challenging conditions
- The great ones are great because they can ride at a high level consistently
- The great ones are great when things aren't good--headwinds, alpine
- Can prime cycling be learned? Prime cycling is about developing skills
- What race are you competing in?
  - Competitive: Against others
  - Race against the course: The course is trying to crush you, if you can't win the course you can't win competitively
  - Mental race: When "why am I here" gets into your mind, you are starting to lose

#### Prime Cycling Framework

- Pain
- Emotions
- Focus
- Stress/Intensity
- Confidence
- Motivation

#### Motivation:  The determination and drive to achieve your goals.

- This is EVERYTHING.
- Effort and goals. Big goals mean "am I doing the work necessary." Lower your goals or raise your effort.
- The grind. No matter how much you love to ride, you get to the point where it's no longer fun. It's boring, it's tiring, it hurts. When most people get to the grind they stop. *The great cyclists, when they hit the grind, that's when it really starts to matter. That's what gonna make the difference between those who achieve their goals and those who don't. This is when you make the most deposits in that bank.*
- *When you're hurting the most, focus on why you're hurting, because your body is communicating very powerfully that it wants you to stop.* And if your mind says "okay I'll stop" then game over. This draws yourself further from the pain, and it focuses you on what you want to do. *Have a reason for why you're hurting out there.*
- Also, train in a group. You'll probably be better if you're with other people. Identify your greatest competitor, and think what they're doing that you aren't.
- Compete for the right reasons. *You want it because you want it. Hopefully you do it because you love it.*

#### Confidence: How strongly you believe in your ability to achieve your goals

- Most important mental factor. You can have all the ability in the world but if you don't believe in that ability, you're not going to force yourself. You will think that you'll crash at mile 80.
- Confidence is a skill you develop with practice. It's easy to stay positive, motivated, and confident when things are going well. When your body is surrendering, . Whenever you think there's nothing left, there's always something left. The body learns through adaptation to always keep something in reserve (ancient hunters still need to get home after killing game).
- Preparation. Every time you go for a ride, you are putting money in the bank. You want to put as much money as possible. Your goal is to get prepared. *I'm as prepared as I can be to achieve my goals.*
- Mental toolbox: Pull out all the tools necessary to fix this problem.
- Self-talk: Next time you go out on a ride, be aware of the things you tell yourself. "Keep going, keep going. I chose to do this, I'm going to make it to the top."

#### Intensity: Amount of physiological activity you feel before and during races

- We are physical beings. Mental stuff doesn't matter if your body physically cannot do it.
- Everybody has their own place. What is your ideal intensity? Being nervous burns fuel.
- Breathing. On a tough climb, when your body is dying, the one thing you have control over is your breathing.
- Shake out arms periodically. When you grip your handlebars tight, arms go up, shoulder goes up, center of gravity goes up, you become slower. Loosen your muscles and lower your intensity.
- Change position. When your body is rebelling, change something, move back in the seat, go to the drops, whatever. When you stay at the same position, your body will rebel, so change your intensity.
- Smile (hehe). For some reason smiling removes the tension in your body. We become conditioned to smiling. Smiling means we're happy. Smiling also releases endorphins, and it is hard to be something that is inconsistent with what our body is telling us. When smiling, your body tells us that things are okay.

#### Focus: Concentrate on things that help and avoid distractions that hurt performance

- Quality training. You cannot engage in quality training if you are not focused the entire time. You have to stay totally focused the entire time.
- Efficiency. Your body will perform at the highest level only when you're focused on doing it. Shifting between distraction/focus will mean a shift in performance.
- Keywords. When climbing, you have a tendency to get negative. "Breathe." "Calm." "Attack." If you're consistently thinking of something, you are doing it.
- 3 Ps:
  - Positive: Focus on positive things.
  - Process: What do I need to do to perform my best?
  - Present: What do I do NOW? You can't change the past but you can ruin the future by worrying about it.
- *What do I mean by concentration? I mean focusing totally on the business at hand and commanding yourself to do exactly what you want to do.*
- Last 100 meters of a sprint, there is no room to lose focus.

#### Emotions: Intense states that arise in response to situations that influence thoughts and behavior

- Common emotions in cycling: fear, frustration, anger, despair, but also excitement, joy, pride, inspiration. Emotions are two sides of the same coin--you can't experience the good ones unless you experience the bad ones.
- Cycling peels the onion away. After a long, hard ride, you are at your purest--good, bad, and ugly. It can be incredibly painful but it could be incredibly therapeutic.
- Emotions affect us psychologically and physiologically as well--can you ride home when you're angry, relative to despair?
- Emotional reactions to race situations--reacting to a flat, to cramps.
- *Whoever loses emotional control first loses.*
- Recognize "hot button" situations. Despair is not a good emotion at all but remind yourself that there is always something left. When I despair, I yell at myself to get angry so I won't be in despair. "This is when things start to fall apart, but they do come back."
- Keys to Emotional Mastery
  - Step back. Gear back, give yourself some distance from people. Take deep breaths, relax your muscles.
  - Figure out why you feel this emotion.
  - Find a solution. "I'll back off for the mean time."
- Emotions and nutrition. When I feel bad emotions, I might have a nutritional crisis. Usually this re- energizes your system.

#### Pain: Sensory and emotional experience of discomfort, distress, or agony

- If it wasn't hard, why do it?
- Pain is an instinctive mechanism to protect against threat to life.
- The pain we experience now is typically not going to kill us during a ride.
- Pain is physical and psychological. How we look at our pain influences how we experience pain.
- "What people have when they have cancer, it hurts more." "Pain? My injuries are worst." Honestly, it's physical discomfort. We can take it off once we get out of the bike.
- Interpretation of pain: normal, this means we're working hard. *If cycling wasn't hard, we wouldn't do it.*
- Pain is something we seek out every time we go on our bike.
- Relax: deep breathing, loosen muscles.
- Use the pain as information. Elite marathoners associate themselves to the pain.
- Generate positive thoughts and emotions. The next time you feel pain in your bike, connect positive emotions. You will feel less pain. Tell yourself: "I'm working hard, I'm achieving my goals."
- Inspiration and pride. "At cycling's core lies pain... it doesn't matter if you're sprinting for an Olympic medal, a town sign, a trailhead, or the rest stop. If you never confront pain, you're missing the essence of the sport."

### Q&A
- Technology means that you have tools in your mental toolbox. Technology might make you lose touch with your internal biological systems. You can't be totally wired in a ride, part of the experience is to figure out your body.
- If athletes can maintain their training, their speeds will still be maintainable.
- The only person who cares about your ride is YOU.
