## Six Things You Need to Know About Training Zones

*Riding at different intensities brings about different physiological adaptations,* and the idea behind having specific training zones is you can control and measure how hard you are riding, thus giving you the ability to target specific improvements in your form.

*Aerobic threshold*--the maximum intensity at which you can ride without blood lactate levels increasing.

*Anaerobic threshold*--This is your functional threshold power (FTP), or the maximum heart rate you can sustain for one hour. At this point the amount of lactate in the blood is elevated but still under control. Ride any harder and the amount of lactic acid will increase exponentially, you will be riding in the red and the effort will become unsustainable.

*Zone one--active recovery.* Training at this intensity means you can stay active without being fatigued. After training hard your body will often go in to shut down mode to try and recover as quickly as possible. Training in zone one will allow you to keep your legs turning over without adding to your levels of fatigue. *Ride in zone one when you need to recover from a hard session but don't want to feel sluggisn the next day.*

*Zone two--endurance.* Base training riding. Riding in zone two teaches your body to burn fat as a fuel source and encourages your body to produce more mitochondria. The very top of zone two is your aerobic threshold. Your blood lactate shouldn't be elevated. *Ride in zone two to work on your base fitness. Sessions in zone two can last up to six or seven hours for pro cyclists but you don't need to ride for that long to feel the benefit.*

*Zone three--tempo.* When in zone three you will be riding in when riding hard but comfortably. Training in zone three is like zone two but is more tiring. *Ride in zone three to stimulate your body to increase the amount of glycogen it can store (in zone three, glycogen usage is starting to overtake fat usage as the primary fuel source). One to three hours is the rough period of time you shouold be able to sustain in zone three.*

*Zone four--threshold.* Zone four works on your anaerobic threshold. The zone starts just below a rider's anaerobic threshold and stretches to just above. This allows a rider to push up their anaerobic threshold using longer intervals and pull up their threshold by training using shorter intervals. *Train in zone four to push up your anaerobic threshold. Zone four training is done in intervals with a period of recovery between efforts. You should be able to maintain zone four for between ten minutes and one hour.*

*Zone five--VO2.* Training in zone five is very fatiguing and leg burning. In shorter efforts, your heart rate may not have time to respond to the effort and your maximum heart rate may actually be after you've reached the top of a climb. *Training in this zone works on your cardiac output--how much and how quickly your heart can pump blood to where it is needed in your muscles.*

*Zone six--anaerobic.* This is the zone you can hold up to three minutes. *Train this to get better in attacking.*

*Zone seven--neuromuscular power. Train this to increase your muscle size for sprinting.*

If you can't reach the zone you are aiming for, then you won't get out of the session what you are aiming to. So if you can only sustain zone four instead of zone five for your climb, then it's time to build some recovery into your training plan.

Heart rate--as you become tired during the season, your maximum heart rate will drop slightly.

The time spent in a particular zone is more important than the average heart rate or power. Periods of recovery while training are very important as they mean that you can hit and maintain zone four in threshold efforts. Doing recovery blocks in zone one instead of zone two means that when it's time to start riding hard again you're much fresher and can still put out the numbers you need too. *By riding easier in the recovery blocks you will actually get home with a lower average heart rate and average power, however, the quality of the session is likely to be higher as you will be hitting the correct intensity in the efforts..*
