## Six things you need to know about base training

*Base training is the training that teaches your body to utilize oxygen as efficiently as possible.* They are long and steady, undertaken at a moderate intensity which allows your body to make the necessary adaptations. All the training you do builds on top of the training you have already done, growing towards a peak of form.

First purpose: it lays down the foundations for everything else to build on, it teaches your body to deal with a given amount of training. When you will be doing harder training sessions, your body will be able to cope and you won't become too tired.

Second purpose: Improves the efficiency of your body in order to increase the power and speed at which you can ride without becoming fatigued.

*If you can sustain a conversation then you are training at the correct level. If you need to take a breather then you are riding too hard.*

The most accurate way though is to use a heart monitor or power meter, about 60-70% of your maximum heart rate. *Riding at this intensity teaches your body to burn predominantly fat instead of glycogen.* Glycogen is how your body stores carbohydrates in your body but these stores are very limited and even when fully topped out will only last for between 30-90 minutes of intensive exercise. *To be able to ride for four or five hours cyclists use fat as an energy source, however in order to burn fat your body still needs a small supply of carbohydrates, so it's important to keep eating on a base ride.*

As the intensity of exercise increases, more glycogen and less fat gets burnt. Base training improves the efficiency of your engine, so the higher the intensity at which you can keep using predominantly fat as an energy source, the more glycogen you will have in the bank for the last push on the final climb.

*When riding at the correct intensity for base training, you should be working aerobically--you are providing your body with enough oxygen for the intensity at which you are riding.*

In turn, lactic acid production is under control. *Contrary to popular belief, lactic acid isn't the nasty stuff that makes your legs burn at the top of a climb. Lactic acid is actually a fuel created in the chemical reaction going on in your muscles when they are burning oxygen to produce energy.*

Within muscle cells there are mitochondria. When the mitochondria in the muscles reach their capacity in terms of how much lactic acid they can process, the additional lactic acid goes into your blood stream to be dealt with elsewhere in the body.

When base training correctly, the level of lactic acid in your blood isn't elevated. By riding at base intensity, you are also giving your mitochondria a workout, thus teaching them to process lactic acid, but you are also stimulating them to become better and more efficient at burning fat as a fuel.

A two-hour ride at a cadence of 90-100 rpm and 60-70% maximum heart rate is far better than three hours spent riding going too hard on the climbs and then coasting down the descents. *Consistenyt heart rate is the key.*

Don't ride too hard. If your breathing starts to become labored then you are riding too hard. Two back-to-back three hour base rides over a weekend is far better than riding too hard on Saturday and only being capable of an easy ride on Sunday.

If you are riding at a high cadence then you are doing more pedalling and this will create an ingrained muscle memory. When you are getting tired towards the end of a hard race, your pedalling technique will remain efficient.

Power = torque * cadence. If you keep the cadence up, it keeps the torque lower. This shifts the focus away from muscular power and onto the aerobic system. Doing this means your aerobic system is getting a bigger work out than your muscles, and you become more efficient on the bike. *Muscular adaptations may take place quicker than aerobic ones but you also lose them much quicker. Working on your base now and muscular strength later on means that both will be in top shape come the first events of the season.*

 To make base training not boring, you can add short six to ten-second sprints. Sprints of this length use a different energy system than long endurance workouts and the two can be combined into a session without one affecting the other. *Sprints of this length have been shown to increase your body's production of natural growth hormone.* Including five six-second sprints with eight to ten minutes recovery in the last hour of a ride can actually help you recover better for the next day.

 Base training is about gradually pushing the limits of what your body is capable of. Aim to increase the weekly duration by ten to 15 per cent for two to three weeks and then take an easy week.
