## Cheap Bikes vs Premium Bikes

#### TLDR

- Steel is heavier than Al
-

*Frame/fork.* Hi-tensile steel is strong/tough, but it is heavy compared to lightweight 7005 aluminum. Comparing the hi-tensile steel frame + fork to the aluminium version, the aluminium frame + fork would easily be 1.5kg lighter. This is a huge difference that can be most acutely felt when carrying the folded bike around.

Stiffer aluminum frame would transmit your pedaling forces more efficiently to the drivetrain, resulting in less energy loss. However, this property of the material also means that road vibrations will be felt more strongly by the rider on the aluminum framed bike.

Steel will rust. Even though the steel frame can be painted, rust is unavoidable in tropical Singapore, where the air is humid and there is usually an abundance of rain.

Hi-Tensile steel is drawn straight gauge (frame tubes are all of equal wall thickness throughout the length of the tube). However, the higher stressed parts are only at the ends. This means that the centre portion of the frame tubes are unnecessarily strong, which add to the weight.

7005 Al is double-butted, which means that the walls are thicker and stronger at the ends, and thinner in the middle.

To check if steel or Al, check the weld points. Welds for Al frame/fork are larger than the steel frame/fork.

*Saddle.* Must have enough cushion to prevent butt aches even when you are not wearing padded cycling shorts, but not too much cushion that you sink into it. The shape is also pretty good if you like cycling fast, since it does not restrict your leg movements unlike bigger, more cushy saddles.

*Grips.* Good grips prevent hand numbness. Biologic Arx grips with integrated T-Tool.

*Pedals.* The Suntour pedals have a rubber surface that improves grip during wet conditions.

*Steering System.* Yes, folding bikes may have a more sensitive steering, but I would say it is agile instead of twitchy. *Folding bikes, or small wheeled bikes in general, are very manoeuvrable  in packed traffic or around crowded places.* The turning radius is usually smaller than large wheeled bikes. This is largely due to the geometry of the bike frame/fork, and to a small extent, the smaller wheels.
