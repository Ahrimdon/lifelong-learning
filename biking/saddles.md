## Sheldon Brown Saddle Saddles
[link](http://sheldonbrown.com/saddles.html)

- A saddle is intended to carry some, but not all of your weight. The rest of your weight is mainly carried by your legs, and some by your hands and arms.
- A cyclist who is out of cycling shape from being off a bicycle for a few months or more will start out strong, but the legs will tire rapidly. When the legs tire, the rider sits harder on the saddle, and that's when the trouble starts. *Many saddle complaints are actually traceable to fatigue caused by starting out the season with a longer ride than you are ready for.*
- Soft saddles are comfortable only for short rides. Saddles with excessive padding can cause chafing of the inner thigh.
- If a saddle is too narrow, the sit bones will hang over the sides, and the soft tissues will bear the load. If the saddle is too wide, it is likely to cause chafing of the inner thigh, especially in hot weather.
- A current trend is to put a large hole or dip in the middle of the base in an attempt to reduce pressure on the genitals or prostate.

#### Saddle Height

- A common reason for keeping the saddle set too low is that most bicyclists have never learned the proper technique for mounting and dismounting, so they find it convenient to be able to put a foot -- or both feet -- down to steady the bicycle while they are stopped.
