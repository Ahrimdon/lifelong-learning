- Most gauges are at least consistent even if they're not totally accurate. Get a separate gauge to double check.
- For road riders, it's more like 40% front, 60% rear. About 15-20% less tire pressure on the front wheel.
- Tires leak air over time. At least once a week, see whether the tire has lost any air.
- Our bias is almost always to overinflate. The maximum pressure listed on the sidewall is generally too high, and it doesn't take into account any of the factors that influence your tire pressure: rider size, terrain, type, and more. Higher pressures offer less rolling resistance, and reduce the likelihood of pinch flats.
- Rolling resistance does increase with lower pressure, but rolling resistance increases only slightly, on the order of a few watts of power, even at pressures down to 60 PSI on standard road tires. *The biggest differences in rolling resistance aren't in pressure, but the actual tire you're using.*
- Lower pressure increases cornering grip, and also deforms more around the road surface. *A tire inflated very high will tend to feel chattery, because it's literayll bouncing off of every imperfection in the road surface.*

## 5 Things You Should Know About Tire Pressure

- *It fluctuates as temperatures change.* A 10-degree change in Fahrenheit will increase pressure roughly two percent. 2 psi for every 10 degress up or down. 3-5 psi drop can make a large impact on a rider's perceived vertical stiffness.
- Sustained rim braking during long descents can boost the temperature inside the tube past 300 degrees. To keep tire pressure manageable, don't ride the brakes. Rims can cool down significantly in even a few seconds when brakes aren't applied.
- A wider tire actually rolls faster at a given pressure, due to less sidewall deflection. The rougher the surface, the more lower pressure helps. On unpaved roads, a high pressure tire will deflect off the surface, actually creating more rolling resistance than a lower-pressure tire that conforms to the imperfections.
