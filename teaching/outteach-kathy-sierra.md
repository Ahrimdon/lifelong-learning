# My Favorite Graphs... and the future

Buy this because we kick ass < We buy this because we want you to kick ass.

## Making a best seller:

Hot topic < Publisher has good marketing < author has a name/rep < author focused on reader < enhances a reader's life

Individuals are smart, crowds are stupid.

Better to sound inarticulate (but might be right) than glib/sounds reasonable (but might be wrong).

The Zombie function: "The more you use your reins, the less they'll use their brains."

## User hierarchy of needs (Highest -> Lowest)

- Flow/enchantment: Does it keep me fully engaged, where the world drops away?
- Intuitiveness: Does it feel natural, and doesn't "make me think?"
- Usability: Is it user-friendly?
- Efficiency: Does it let me do what I need without long workarounds?
- Learnability: Can I learn it quickly? Is the manual good?
- Correctness: Does it do it correctly, without a bunch of bugs?
- Does it do what I need?

Death by risk aversion: Fantastic idea -> fear -> actual product suxx

## User Community and ROI

The people who will make your tutorials and docs are your community. Community can do tech support, user training, marketing (evangelism, word of mouth), third-party add-ons, new product ideas.

- Host some kind of discussion forum (can include chat, wikis, and blogs), and do whatever it takes to get people there as soon as possible, ideally while the thing is in beta.
- Look at other third-party forums where users are discussing your product, and find the most active people. Give them non-paid incentives for being active.
- Make these folks members with special privileges and recognition that nobody else will get.
- Have levels and rewards for participating (not money!) -- status, beta access, access to the developers/designers.
- Teach users how to help other members by creating documents.
- Include one off-topic forum.
- Make sure there are interesting ways for users to get to know more about one another (profile pages that include gender, photos, and some other personal info).
- Encourage offline meetups.
- Encourage forum mods/community leaders to have their own private discussion space.
- Don't tolerate abuse of the beginners, but don't force experts to put up with newbie issues. Provide separate areas for newbies and experts.
- Create limited-edition, not-for-sale shirts, stickers, and other gear just for the founding community members. For ongoing communities, do the same thing and distribute them randomly, for free. (Do intermittent variable reward.)
- Make your community leaders/active participants HEROES.
-  Host an offline retreat for the key community leaders.
- Keep teaching members to teach other members. Give everyone a crash course in learning theory.
