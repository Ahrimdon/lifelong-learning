Just because you've lots of software doesn't mean you can write code. And just because you've taken classes, you can't necessarily teach. The idea that "you have been a student, so you can teach well" devalues the art of teaching.

People can be self-taught teaching, but they have to be motivated and they have to appreciate why it's important.

## Eleven Things to Know

1. Know the difference between "listening" and "learning".

Listening is passive. It is the lowest, least-efficient, least-effective form of learning. Lectures are the least effective learn of listening. Listening to learn is like watching someone lift to get in shape.

2. The brain makes decisions about what to pay attention to, and what to remember.

Emotions provide the metadata for a memory. They're tags that determine how important the memory is. People remember what they *feel* far more than what they hear.

3. Know how to apply #2, know how to get your learners to feel.

4. Know the wide variety of learning styles, and how to incorporate as many as possible into your learning experience.

This isn't about "visual learning" and "auditory learning". Every sighted person is a "visual learner", and everyone learns through examples. Step-by-step instructions. High-level forest views. Low-level tree views. Pictures, explanations, and examples.

5. Know the fundamentals of current learning theory.

6. Know why--and how--good advertising works.

7. Know why--and how--good stories work.

Consider the learner to be on a kind of hero's journey. Think of your student as Frodo and yourself as Gandalf and learn as much as you can about storytelling and entertainment. Learn what screenwriters and novelists learn. Know what "show don't tell" really means and understand how to apply it to learning.

Humans spent thousands of years developing to learn through stories, not through sitting in a classroom listening passively to a lecture of facts. We learn *in spite* of the poor learning delivery most of us get in traditional schools and training programs.

8. Know a little something about "the Socratic method". Know why it's far more important that you ask the good questions rather than supply the answers.

9. Know why people learn more from seeing the *wrong* thing rather than the *right* thing. Know why the brain spends less time processing things that meet expectations than it does on things that don't.

10. Know why it's important to study and keep up your teaching skills as it is to keep your other professional skills.

11. Know why using overhead slides is the worst.

12. Know why good games keep people involved and engaged for hours.
