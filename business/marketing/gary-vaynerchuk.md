- Working hard isn't going to help you get out of every situation.
- Some people just don't have the appropriate constitution to handle repeated failure over and over again.
- I think his intentions are good, but he's oversaturated himself.
- Simply provide value. People will figure out that you are an expert in the field.
- Pro Tip, then elevator pitch.
- An educated consumer is our best customer.
- People like to bash, but that's just stupid. The people bashing are not the ones selling lots of books. Nothing he says is wrong. It's not bad advice. It's just sort of vague. It's not his fault, it has to be in order to be relevant to a wide audience.
- The hardest working component of Gary Vee -- the thing driving the advice -- is celebrity. Gary Vee's business success is a product of popularity as a business asset. It's the missing ingredient from any attempt at doing what Gary Vee does.
- You want to start understanding that Gary Vee's online persona is a platform (marketing platform) only Gary Vee has access to. If you want to do anywhere as well as Gary Vee, including an agency clientele, you have to understand the platform concept.
- My company talked with VaynerMedia about doing some influencer work. $20k a month to work with 20 influencers. We hired a girl for $15/hr to just DM influencers all day and give away product. Got better results.
- They really just pursue huge companies that have millions to spend on different marketing agencies. Anyone can do this in house but most companies prefer to have 10-15 different marketing agencies and they can just move around the industry without having the fixed cost of staff.
- Also a friend has been reached out to by VaynerMedia to be an influencers for a whiskey company. $1,500 for 15 posts on IG (she is a micro influencer) she has to send the pics and captions for approval before. Got paid half up front half at final
- Honestly, what’s in it for you? He’s all about producing meaningful content that’s directed toward your audience. What’s wrong with it? He’s about being interactive and consistent on social media to build your brand. What’s wrong with it? He’s about producing quality advertising on social media because it’s underpriced compared to other modes of advertising, depending on your demographic and directly to them also. What’s wrong with that?
- If you’re a content marketer or a content producer then you can learn something very valuable from him. Which is that your content isn't about isn’t just about delivering the big picture message. He’s really good at nuancing his message in a way that his content seems fresh and new everyday.
- His vlog isn’t just about motivation. He does give a lot of great insights about social media and how to leverage it. His vlog on his $1.80 instragram strategy is spot on. His vlog on how to network via direct messaging on IG is gold. And there are tons more great pieces of advice that can help anyone make a respectable living off of digital marketing or social media. Heck, his entire vlog (and other SM platforms) is a great example of how to re-purpose content.
- He is definitely entertaining, and swears a lot more in his talks than he used to. But his advice is solid inasmuch that you give value every day, and participate and listen to your target market relentlessly, you can have a shot at relevance.
- If you're not seeming to be relevant, then listen more and give more value, and ask nothing in return. Keep doing this until that changes, or give up and do something else with yourself.
- Gary's primary message is "Put in the work". That's what all his stuff ultimately comes down to. Self awareness and a good work ethic.
