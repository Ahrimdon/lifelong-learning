# Side Hustle Ideas for Software Developers
[Reference](https://daedtech.com/side-hustle-ideas-software-developers/)

- On build software as a side hustle: you're already biased for it and you might just procrastinate more.
- E-Book. I suggest a detailed How-To that you think will help and appeal to people. 25K words? Learnings: how to build a product, how to promote it, and you establish instant credibility and authority when you publish a book (or self-publish).
- Affiliate marketing. Simple Programmer does this. You get to establish authority, but much more gradually.
- Courses and Info Products. Pluralsight, Udemy, Lynda.com. You benefit: Work with editors, you build relationships, you establish some authority.
- These are: small potatoes, assume you have a little audience, is about learning, and not something that a no-compete clause can stop.
- Other learnings: how to market and promote something, where and how to accept money outside of work and keep your books fro something, building a website to promote the things you do.
- So what I recommend instead is that you take on a side hustle that you view more as a stepping stone.  Start small with a tiny E-book.  Then build a blog that makes you more money, and start building info products.  You’ll learn a lot about business in general, including how to market, sell, and find money outside of your employer.  And once you’ve done all of that, turning a side hustle into a full time hustle won’t be a daunting life choice, but an option that exists whenever you choose to take advantage.
