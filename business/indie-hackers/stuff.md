## Practical Golf
[Reference](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/practical-golf)

- In 2015 I founded Practical Golf, a blog that is focused on giving honest coaching advice to the everyday golfer.
- My site has multiple revenue streams (affiliate income, premium memberships, my book, and consulting), but for this article I am going to focus on how I was able to write the book, which generated more than $25,000 in revenue.
- Looking back on what I wrote, it wasn't that good. But if you want to become a writer, you have to write… a lot.
- Then the idea hit me that I wanted to make an informal reference guide that didn't follow the traditional format of a non-fiction book. I thought it would be interesting to chronicle all the mistakes that golfers make, and offer reasonable solutions. My goal was to produce something a golfer of any level could read in an afternoon, and get real advice on how to improve.
- Luckily my wife was an experienced copy editor, so as I finished chapters she would edit them, which saved money on hiring someone else (which you absolutely should do if you are going to publish a book). The only true out-of-pocket expense I had was about $60 to buy a Word template that would convert to paperback publishing standards for Amazon.
- I chose Amazon for 101 Mistakes because at the time my website had a limited audience. It was an easy decision because it was the difference between marketing it to several thousand golfers, or several million. The tradeoff was giving up 33% of the revenue to Amazon, which I figured was well worth it.
- So now the book had a clean looking sales page — positive official quotes and a bunch of five star reviews from people who had actually read it and liked the content. The last piece of the puzzle was a successful launch.
- This is where having an existing audience really paid off. For about a year I had built up an email list by offering golfers weekly advice through my blog. On the official launch day I wrote an email announcing the book, clicked send, and hoped for the best.

## Hercules
[Reference](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/hercules)

- After quitting my job I wanted to build a business and earn some passive income. I thought making an app would be perfect for that. At that moment I was working out several times a week with a popular method in France. I wanted an app to track my progress and get rid of my pen and paper.
- I wrote the first line of code in 2013, October 27th. To make a long story short, I negotiated a six-month part-time contract with my latest client after quitting my consulting agency. This way I could spend all my evenings, plus weekends and Mondays, on the app. 3 days in a row every week — perfect to get things done!
- I learned the hard way that losing several weeks of development costs so much more than a $150 phone! Never spend your time to earn money; spend your money to earn time.
- The interesting thing here is that at the very beginning, adding fully-customizable exercises, pictures, and rest times in the app was an extremely painful process. But today, this exact same feature makes the app so appealing to my users. They are delighted to be able to set different reps, weights, and rest times for each set! Lots of trainings now use this technique to increase muscle gains, so Hercules is perfect for them.
- Because I was a total newbie in the bodybuilding domain I registered on the #1 bodybuilding forum in France, musculaction.com, to learn more from my future customers. I contacted the administrator and he accepted to add a specific topic for Hercules so I could talk about it.
- The secret to ranking on the Play Store is to market your app outside of it. You must drive traffic from the outside to the Play Store before organic growth starts to kick in.
- Write your app description not for your users (because nobody reads it) but for the search engine. To know what keywords to use, do this: type the first letters of a keyword that a user could enter to search for your app in the Play Store. The auto-completion feature of the Play Store will propose several queries for you. These queries are the most common searched queries by people. Write down keywords and expressions of the top 3 queries and do this again and again until you have lots of keywords.
- Put these keywords and expressions at least 5 times in your app description and use the most common one for your title. Write the full text of your app description so a human can read it and enjoy it; don't stuff it with keywords or you'll be penalized. Just be sure to insert in an elegant way all your keywords and expressions at least 5 times.
- **If you can afford it, translate your app into the most important languages, English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian. 40% of my revenue is made abroad. Don't forget to translate your screenshots too, and localize them. For example, in France we use the kg unit by default, in US it's lb — these little details make the difference.**
- Build a website and do some SEO: I built mine in a few hours with Strikingly. There are tons of websites builders out there to do this easily and quickly. Don't lose time on this. Subscribe to one of these services.
- Content marketing: Open a WordPress blog and write a post whose title is "The best app for X!" I did this and got a ton of traffic. In this blog post I compare 5 workout apps including mine of course and do pros/cons.
- BONUS TIP: Use the year in your title. Because we want fresh content we often write "Best android workout app 2017". Oh! What a coincidence, I have exactly this kind of blog post here. I even pushed it further by just talking about my app. The title is basically "the best android workout app of 2017", and I posted it on January 1st, 2017. I did this also because the craze of new year's resolutions is a huge booster for my sales. So I wanted to be ready ASAP.
- A/B testing: the developer console lets you do some A/B testing on your title, description and icon. So use it to test what gives you the best conversion rate!
- Blogs: contact some blogs related to your market and propose some guest posts to talk about the app. Do some free partnerships. Talk about the blog and they will talk about you. Exchange links. That's good for SEO and long term ranking.
- Answer to questions on Quora that relate to your business or application. For example, if someone ask for the best workout app on mobile you should definitely answer to this! That's free advertisement.
- I tried to make money from advertisement, but it didn't work at all. People use the app to do their workouts. They are focus so they have no time to click on an ad when using the app. I had some terrible conversion rates and didn't make a lot of money with ads. I stopped almost immediately, because it didn't work and because I hate ads.
- I thought raising the price would make fewer people buy the app, but it increased the sales volume. I didn't understand why. But after a while I figured it out: value is connected to the price. If you sell something cheap, people will think it doesn't provide a lot of value because the price is so low. Raise the price and they will definitely reconsider their thoughts. So I gradually raised the price from $1.99 to $2.99, and then $6.99, and now $9.99! Each time I shipped a big feature I raised the price.
- Also, I made the mistake of developing on Android first (because I knew JAVA) instead of iOS. But iOS users are more willing to pay for apps. They have more purchase power. There is more competition for sure too. But every day I have guys asking me when Hercules will be on iOS. And I say, "Never." I don't have the energy to do everything again on iOS.
- Find a solution and draw some screenshots of the app or product you have in mind; do not produce a single line of code
- Test your idea by doing a landing page, patreon page, kickstarter, or whatever to make people pay before building anything. And I mean PAY — they must enter their credit card info here. Someone telling you he or she would buy your product is NOT an actual customer that will purchase your product when it's out.
- If more than 10% pay, build the product, or go back to #1

## Sidebar
[Reference](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/sidebar)

- I first started Sidebar as a way to drive traffic to a now-defunct project of mine called `Folyo`, one of the many sites trying to hook up companies and designers.
- To be honest, the newsletter concept (five links a day) was meant as a "teaser" version of sorts, a way to kickstart the audience before I opened up the site to public posting, comments, votes, etc.
- A few things then happened within the span of a couple months: I became quite interested in Meteor; I used it to build Sidebar; I decided to open source all my work; and finally, I decided to turn my newly-aquired knowledge into a book about Meteor, Discover Meteor (co-authored with Tom Coleman).
- The open-source app featured in this book became Telescope, and ultimately transformed into VulcanJS, a new React & GraphQL app-building framework that I'm in fact using to power the latest version of Sidebar.
- I add about 2,000 new emails per year, which is not nothing, but also nothing extraordinary when you know other popular design newsletters have readership in the hundreds of thousands.
- I think one of the difficulties in growing a newsletter audience is that unlike a blog, a newsletter is not a destination in itself. A newsletter won't go viral or make front-page news unless it adds new features. Not to mention, there are only so many features you can add to a good old HTML email.
- Sidebar's business model is pretty simple: once a week, one of the five links will be a sponsored link. In other words, 4 links per month out of ~150 are sponsored, and each sponsorship costs $950.
- Job board: I got someone through Upwork to go through competing job boards and find me the contact email of all the companies that have posted design jobs recently.
- I guess my main piece of advice would be not to overlook even the smallest ideas. Sending people five links a day might sound too simple to ever be a business, but if you do it over and over and over again every single day, it can actually turn into a nice revenue source eventually.

- Offer great free apps, online tools, open-source components, Chrome extensions--to get people to hear about us.

- Build backlinks, a personal brand, establish yourself as an expert, make connections, speak at conferences, it's not the lack of ideas that holds you back, it's procrastination.
