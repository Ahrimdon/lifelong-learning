## Jitbit
[Reference](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/jitbit-software)

- Jitbit help desk: even though the niche was super crowded, I saw how huge the market was and how clumsy the existing systems were.
- Offer great free apps, online tools, open-source components, Chrome extensions--to get people to hear about us.
- B2B: You sell to people who care about their jobs, bosses, promotions, and their paychecks. It is about "covering my ass" and "making me a hero".
- Tiered pricing: Everyone wants to be an "enterprise".
- No demos. No phone support. Email is to an actual developer. No paid acquisition channel.
- Build backlinks, a personal brand, establish yourself as an expert, make connections, speak at conferences, it's not the lack of ideas that holds you back, it's procrastination.
- **Also, I heard this brilliant phrase from Joel Spolsky at some meetup: "You can teach a software engineer to do marketing/management/business-stuff, but you cannot teach an MBA how to write good code."
**

## Timetastic
[Reference](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/timetastic)

- Over-complex processes to take a day off from work.
- Ruby, then PHP, then .NET.
- We tried some of the products out there but remained frustrated, so we took the plunge.
- 18 months and 40k pounds to get profitable.
- People just not find you on the Internet.
- Increase in monthly revenue growth:
  - Flexibility. Each company has a different contract.
  - Outsourced adwords. We now have a steady stream of conversions at a steady and profitable cost per conversion.
  - Attrition. **We might be lucky in that when companies embrace new systems they do stick with them, but I also believe having solid, good value product and is well supported contributes to a large degree.**
- Subscription based: $1 per user per month. No other options and no other price tiers. Pay by debit or credit card each month.
- Overheads: static, salaries, adwords, accounting software, customer management software, card processing fees.
- Helpful: One price plan and one way of paying. We never negotiate on the price or payment mechanism. Every single customer pays the same, and we never negotiate on the price or payment mechanism. Every single customer pays the same, and with a credit/debit card on a monthly basis, no sales team or account managers to negotiate pricing.
- Never have to chase payments. If the payment fails we send an email to update your details and suspend your account.
- Invoicing: comes with the accounting software.
- Support: online only. We work from home.
- This means we are never interrupted. Productive, value-adding work. Code, UX, design, marketing initiatives.

- Flight search service that connects travelers with air travel experts.
- MongoDB/Node/Angular/batch jobs.
- Guerilla marketing using Facebook and Twitter accounts.
- Then we launched a blog and a mailing list, then bloggers/other travel domain.
- Affiliate commissions and discounts for cross promotion.
- Need CDN for server's response times.
- Blog posts from influential bloggers = most effective for sales.
- Clients pay for the service and get personal advice on where and how to book cheap flights.
- If we can't find a cheaper flight, then the service is free.
- Stripe authorization for the payment gateway.
- Goal: expand to B2B area/get more corporate clients, since this reduces customer service efforts and businesses fly their employees more often.
- Mentor who could mediate between me and my co-founder.
- Customer service person = better to find them earlier.
- If B2C, try to get B2B.
- Advantage: no need to do product validation because this is a product that people wanted.
- **If something comes our way, it should be tried, preferably straight away.**
- Document management--Google docs.
