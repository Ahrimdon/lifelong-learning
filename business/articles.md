- Warby Parker: Direct to Consumer.
- By selling directly to consumers online, you can avoid exorbitant retail markups and therefore afford to offer some combination of better design, quality, service, and lower prices because you've cut out the middleman.
- And by connecting directly with consumers online, you can also better control your messages to them and, in turn, gather data about their purchase behavior, thereby enabling you to build a smarter product engine.
- One, nearly every product category will see at least one DTC challenger. And two, largely because of that proliferation, it's harder than ever to build a big, profitable business with the Warby model.
- 20 and 30-something consumers are digital natives with lots of buying power who have no attachment to mall brands and big-box stores.
- Instagram + experimental marketing + brands as lifestyles.
- *Whether a DTC startup can actually deliver better value than its predecessors depends on how broken the existing market is.*
  - For eye wear, it was dominated by one giant conglomerate, which makes everything.
  - For razors, Gillette commanded more than 70% of the market worldwide.
- Large-scale digital marketing: FB, IG, and Google. They extract the most of consumer attention.
- Customer acquisition cost: the thing you pay for in Google/FB/IG as ads. Facebook and Google are the new middlemen.
- "In the beginning, I think you really underestimate how much it costs to get people to buy."
- Moving into retail = possibly a red flag, because if it's working online, why all the retail stores?
