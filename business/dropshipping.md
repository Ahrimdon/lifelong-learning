- Social selling, high quality customer service, building a credible brand.
- Digital marketing: you will find hard times and good times.
- Social selling:
  - Using influencers, not a "cold call". Social selling allows you to "soft sell" your items through various social media tools.
  - You can promote your item to a network and allow the users on that network to check in for updates and new feeds.
  - Base your value proposition and message on their social profile and social story.
  - Selling has always been a social art. Promoting a rock concert = putting up signs or talking with people at the popular bars.
  - Facebook page, better if there are likes there already. By having your closest network "Like" and "Follow" your page, there is a larger presence to people that are not very familiar with your new venture.
- You'll want to give people a reason to "Like" or "Follow" you, and once they have found you, you'll want to keep them engaged.
