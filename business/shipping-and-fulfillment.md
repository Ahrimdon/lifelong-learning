[Reference](https://www.shopify.com.ph/guides/shipping-and-fulfillment-101)

- Factors that affect the shipping/fulfillment strategy:
  - Your brand, where your products are shipping from and to, your average order value, your product's margins, your product's weight, the preferences for tracking and insurance, carrier preferences, customer shipping preferences, product costs, restrictions and regulations, customs and duties.
- Strategies:
  - Ship it yourself: shipping from home, writing labels, walking to the post office.
  - Ship it yourself, but more advanced: label printing, package pickup from your courier.
  - Fulfillment warehouse.
  - Dropship: are shipped directly from a partner or on behalf of your brand.
- Charging customers:
  - Shipping is an unnecessary charge re: online business.
  - To mitigate: Offer free shipping, charge exact costs based on the real-time shipping carrier rates, or do flat-rate shipping ($10 flat rate to all of USA).
  - For luxury/handmade items, an extra percentage for shipping/handling probably isn't too much of an issue and it will be hard for consumers to notice.
  - In a competitive market, your customers will notice the shipping thing.
  - Exact cost, you offload the decision on how to ship to the customer.
  - Flat rates: it really depends on the carrier.
- Packaging:
  - Utility or branded, experience focused packaging.
  - Figure out where you can buy packaging materials.
