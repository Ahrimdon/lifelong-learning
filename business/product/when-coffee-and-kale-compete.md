# When Coffee and Kale Compete: Becoming Great at Making Products People Will Buy

- Instead of attaching value to what products are, value should attach to what products do for customers.
- Stop trying to communicate value with new and improved product features, and star designing more integrated product experiences that are valuable because of what they enable customers to get done in particular contexts of use.
- Snickers: Since 1930, they were viewed as food, but it was in 1979 when they were started to get viewed as giving customers a reason to connect Snickers use with every day hunger situations.
- Marketing communications should focus on what a product does for and to the customer, not on what it is. A Snickers satisfies hunger. Milky Way recognized the differences between "comfort me" and "satisfy my hunger".
- ***Job: The progress that an individual is trying to make in a particular circumstance. And for innovators, understanding the Job is to understand what customers care most about in that movement of trying to make progress, the causal mechanism of customer behavior.***
- Self-Betterment: the demand side of innovation. Self-betterment can be a basis for innovators to work out what should be next.
- Humans have a compelling imperative to better themselves. His thinking echoes the work we have been doing to explain why people, whose needs are already well met, still hunt the market for new ideas.

## Challenges, Hope, and Progress

- Focusing on two things:
  - The desire every customer has to improve themselves and their life situation.
  - How customers imagine their lives being better when they have the right solution.
- Challenges:
  - The average time a company spends on the S&P 500 continues to drop. It's never been easier to create a product and get it to customers. This increases the pace at which new innovations disrupt the sales of incumbent ones and then go on to replace them.
  - When an innovation wins, another loses, because a day has only so many minutes, and a customer can only use one product at a time. If you buy a machine that makes espressos, the coffee shop loses its business.
  - The idea: customers buy a product to complete a Job to be Done.
  - We sometimes study and improve on customers' needs and expectations of today, instead we should just create new systems that help customers make progress.
    - Ex: Pony Express replaced by telegraph. Phone keyboard replaced by touchscreen.
- We can get misled when we manage by visible figures only.
  - Monthly active users: do we want this to go up, or do we just let them stay so we don't drive away loyal users.
  - All models are wrong, but some are useful.

- Hope
  - Alignment and distributed decision making: *Everyone in the business should use the same customer insights to market, design, and manage solutions that customers will buy and use to make progress in their lives.*
  - This empowers employees throughout the organization to make good decisions that align with the job, be autonomous and innovative.
  - When we design, we're faced with the countless trade-offs involved in developing a biz strategy, crafting advertising, designing, and engineering, from which good questions arise.
- Growth mindset:
  - Organizations grow when they offer a growth opportunity to existing and potential customers. No one wants to solve their problems only, we want someone to also give us new and better ways to improve our life-situations in meaningful ways.
  - Growth-related questions:
    - How can we make sure people continue to buy our existing product?
    - How can we get more people to buy our product, or get them to buy more of it?
    - What additional products and services can we create that existing customers will also buy?
    - What additional products/services can we create that can gain us new customers?

# The Job to Be Done

- "Upgrade your user, not your product. Don't build better cameras, build better photographers." Kathy Sierra
- The desire to improve ourselves is in our DNA. It's what makes us human.
- Only a human would think, "If I could transform this lagoon over there into a place where I can breed fish, then I'd never have to go fishing again."
- Humans can desire change. And every time she begins the process of transforming her life-situation, she has a Job to be Done.
- Job theory: We as humans want to improve our various life situations in a variety of ways. This exploration of our core desire to improve ourselves has a long philosophical tradition.
- ***Self-betterment is a core human desire that pervades our history.***
- *Revlon: "In the factory, we make cosmetics. In the drugstore, we sell hope." Revlon is selling transformation, the idea that with this product, you'll be abler to create a "new me" that is desirable in ways your "existing me" is not.*
- Products enable customers to get a job done. What's important to the customers: "looking cool", not the components of a skateboard.
- Customer jobs:
  - The customer can actually act this out.
  - The customer actually likes this.
  - This described a better version of the customer.

# Principles of Customer Jobs

- "Are things better for me today than yesterday? Am I getting closer to that picture in my mind of how I want my life to be?"
- Favor progress over outcomes and goals. Customers need to feel successful at every touch point between themselves and your business, not just at the very end when the outcome of an action is realized.
- *Progress defines value, contrast reveals value.* Instead of "Which food do you most prefer, steak or pizza", ask "When do you prefer steak, and when do you prefer pizza?" You understand the value cx place on a product when you compare/contrast the progress is delivers against the progress other products can deliver.
- Weber: Not in the business of making and selling grills. It's in the business of making people better at grilling.

# Part II, Demand and Competition

# Case Study: Dan and Clarity

- Clarity: Place where ents can ask questions of experts.
- "Can you tell me about the other solutions you've tried? What did, or didn't you like about each one?"
- "How do you learn what pushes customers to make a change?" *Ents seeking advice value the messenger often more so than the message.* Turns out that some ents just wanted inspiration from a particular person.
  - Not advice, but an inspiration/they wanted someone they respected to inspire and motivate them to get out of an entrepreneurial slump.
  - So they positioned themselves not as a "you want to talk to this type of person, we have them", but as a "this person has accomplished this, talk to this guy".
  - Positioning Clarity against the cost of going to a conference.
- *Focus on delivering emotional progress (getting a job done), not solely on functionality.*

# Case Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals

- Determine if anxiety is a competitor. If it is, find ways of reducing it. If cx is anxious about cost-value, offer a discount. If anxious in using the product, make it less intimidating.

# Case Study: Morgan the Grocer

- Generate demand: To persuade customers that an electric car could be attractive, Elon needed to make sure he can make an affordable car.
- Demand reduction:
  - Anxiety-in-choice: "I've never taken the bus to work. Is it on time? Where do I buy a ticket?" "If I use Clarity, will I sound stupid? Is the call going to be recorded? How is payment handled?"
  - Anxiety-in-use: "I wish I knew the bus arrival times in advance, because sometimes it's late."
  - Habits-in-choice: If people are used to something, you need to figure out a way for your new way to import the old one.
  - Habits-in-use.
- ***Inertia and anxiety are your silent competitors.*** At its core, innovation is about helping customers make progress. Get them to that better version of life that they aspire to.
  - You have to account for habits.
- Figure out pushes and pulls.
  - Pushes: First ask about the solutions that customers have used. At what point did they realize that their particular solution wasn't working anymore?
  - Pulls: Why did they choose product X or product Y? What's wrong with product Y? What did X have the Y didn't?
