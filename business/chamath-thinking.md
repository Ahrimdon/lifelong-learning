- Ground truths: data has no bias. SC: Move from trading on credentials and start trading on information.
- Actual tech: a lot of micro-iterations/micro-experiments/micro-failures/incremental improvement.

SC:

- How do we collect data in a scalable way?
- What data matters?
- How do we detect false positives?
- How do we avoid rebuilding the wheel?
- How do we use one companyâ€™s gain to benefit another?

- Machine learning to figure out how to fund projects.
  - First party data collection (company logs, AWS, third party input).
  - ML platform.
  - Knowledge engine that captures best practices, performance, predictive analytics.
- Competitive advantage:
  - The aggregation of strong data science and engineering talent
  - The compounding benefits of proprietary data acquired over 7 years
  - The ability to continue to innovate around data-driven investing
  - SC board members arrive at board meetings armed with objectively observed data-driven insights, not opinions, and use their operational experience to work with founders on achieving excellence. The narrative makes sense, though of course you still need chemistry to make great boards sing.
  -* This paints the picture of a different type of venture firm: data scientists enhancing investment decisions, arming operators with data to sit on boards, and sharing best practice insights across the portfolio.*
