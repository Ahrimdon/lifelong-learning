## The Reality of Starting

It is unproven entrepreneurs who start the world-changing companies such as HP, Apple, eBay, MS, G, Yahoo, and YT.

#### The Inside Story of Ent

1. The best people at a startup care too much.
2. Good people need big projects. If you aren't doing something worthwile, you can't get anyone worthwhile to work on it.
3. Startups are freak catchers. You have to be fundamentally unhappy with the way things are and unrealistic enough to believe the world can change.
4. Good code takes time.
5. Everybody has to rebuild.

## Reality of Marketing

1. *Seize the high ground: "Making meaning", "doing good", "changing the world", "making people happy".*
2. Create one message: Stick with that message for a year.
3. Frame or be framed: An online music-sharing service is either "piracy" or "music-listeners' revolution." Using the word revolution implies that record companies are unfairly ruling people who listen to music.
	- Be true to yourself. A frame should represent what YOU stand for.
	- Avoid the frontal assault. The goal is to frame your competition that isn't harshly critical, but clever and damning.
	- Draw first blood: Better to do it first.

## The Reality of Selling and Evangelizing

SALES FIX EVERYTHING. As long as cash is flowing:

- Emotive. It compels people to tell others about it.

- Consensus

## Creating a Community

- Create something worth building a community around.
- Assign one "champion" the task of building a community.
- Give people something to chew on.
- Welcome criticism.

## The Reality of Competing

- Know thyself.
- Know thy customer.
- Know thy enemy.
- Focus on the cx.
- Turn the cx into evangelists.

## Hiring and Firing

- Ignore the irrelevant.
- Hire infected people: Is the candidate infected with a love of your product?
- Hire better than yourself.
- Double-check your intuition. Ask every candidate the same questiosn and take extensive ones.

#### Firing

- Consult impartial people.
- Get professional advice.
- Give people a second chance.
- Document everything.
- Do it yourself.
- Be firm.
- Show people the door. The day you fire someone should be the last day that person is in the office.
- Don't disparage the victim.

## Working

Intrusive and negative thoughts cause a load that interrupts and harms performance.
