##[Teens aren’t abandoning “social.” They’re just using the word correctly.](https://medium.com/understandings-epiphanies/aae8d5f880cc)

Facebook is a big part of many companies' marketing budgets, and they want to reach the kids.

Marketers have sold social to clients for the past few years.

Some say old people have ruined FB by their presence. But Tumblr, even without a lot of old people, while increasing their user base, lost importance to teens.

Cyberbullying and drama can contribute.

FB is pretty boring compared to Reddit.

But kids probably literally don't need FB. To >25 people, FB is a class reunion + gossip + what are my coworkers doing. You can get to keep tabs on your friends and acquaintances.

Kids do that already in school.

Twitter resurgence because it is like one big group SMS: texting, but to everybody.

Creeping mom theory is why kids like disposable shit like Snapchat and Kik. Problem with Snapchat is, screenshot can be done on phones.
