UI
* While loading: Need the loader
* Codecademy: Progress (Gauge, badges, join groups?)
* Khan Academy: Mission thing, they want to make it blue for all, badges, goals, activity, focus, skill progress, activity: shows how much you’ve done for the day, skill practice: has badges
* Coursera: Your current courses, syllabus, survey, wiki
* Udacity: Discussions

* Have they found solutions online?
* Do they study or review in a group or by themselves?
* Why did they study accounting?

Stack Overflow Pros
* There is always an answer, and it is always high quality.
* Literally anything can be solved immediately.
* They restrict behavior by making you ask questions first. You get used to asking questions and you get badges.
* They want to make it Wikipedia-style, which means they moderate things heavily.
* Programmers are naturally on the Internet so it is not that hard to grow.
* Tagging, decent. There is always an answer out there for the questions; it is also intellectual to discuss how to solve problems.
Stack Overflow Cons
* Sometimes patronizing.
Codecademy Pros
* The coding console gets you hooked in right away! (Implement this in ICPA?)
* Social networking is optional, but there are badges (cute).
Learn to See, Make, and Deconstruct.
* Learn to see: You have to see the world differently. You not only see what’s in the world, but how the things in the world affect the behavior of other people. Start cataloguing the different things you see, not just in the areas of the products you are building, but the world in general.
* Learn to make: The process of design is to make something, something that changes someone’s behavior. Build something and watch someone else play with it. See if some renditions delight people more than others.
* Learn to deconstruct: Take things apart, categorize the pieces, and build taxonomies and ontologies.
* People are creatures of habit. They have needs, and they are often articulate about those that aren’t being met, or aren’t being met regularly, or very well.
Solve a Problem
* Start with a problem to solve. “I wish it was easier to post photos online.”
* Ask and answer questions about the type of person who has this problem. What parts of their photo-taking experience do they care about? Is it because they need a backup? It it because they want to show things to their friends? Do they care about adjusting the photos?
* Create user stories that illustrate the needs of the user. “As a photographer, I want to upload photos so I could share them with my prospective clients.”
* Storyboard the overall experience.
* Sketch/prototype the user experience. If you are technical, try not to think about the underlying data structures or technology choices.
* Look at how others have solved the problem.
Graphic Designer
* Learn about Information Architecture, structure and present information in a way that would add for a superior user experience.
* If you don’t have a project, make one up. Redesign Quora. Redesign a CRM.
Colm Tuite
* Discover the problem, and don’t be too addicted to misaligned stuff and ugly color schemes. Start looking at websites as solutions, solutions to problems. These include:
* Not optimized for mobile
* Not accessible to screen readers
* Long-ass load time
* Value of the app not immediately obvious
* Too many steps in sign in flow
* Know your users
* What is their average age?
* What browser did they use?
* How did they find your site?
* What do they want from your site?
* What does your site want from them?
* Check out the different entry points for the page, maybe the blog is where most users begin their journey.
* Communicate effectively: Do it in the quickest, most effective way possible.
* “A brief overview of some of the main skills you need for UX design.”
* “An overview of the skills necessary for UX design.”
* “Finally, an awesome UX tutorial.”
* Guide your users on how to take the journey.
* Encourage your users: When a user makes a mistake, tell them how they can figure out the solution.
* Congratulate your users: Reward them and they will feel compelled to use your product.
Dropbox
* MVP: A screencast on Hacker News (April 2007). Lots of immediate, high-quality feedback.
* Not launching = painful, but not learning = fatal.
* Put something in the user’s hands (doesn’t need to be code) and get real feedback ASAP.
* Know where your target audience hangs out and speak to them in an authentic way.
* Experiment failed: Paid search, because the obvious keywords were already bid way up.
* Dropbox user: Heard about Dropbox, said “I didn’t realize I needed this”, “It actually works”, unexpectedly happy and tells friends
* Encourage word of mouth, viral. A referral program with 2-sided incentive permanently increased signups by 60%.
* Surveys, split tests, landing page/signup flow optimization, encourage sharing
* Big investment in analytics
* Weak product cannot be fixed by good marketing
* Possible learning: Adwords tests
* Hook the users first, then educate over time
* Make feedback painless, then iterate!
* “How’s Dropbox?” Awesome or needs work?
* Generate short URLs

Why Education Startups Do Not Succeed

* Entrepreneurs thnk of education as a quality problem. The average person thinks of it as a cost problem.
* Building in education does not follow an Internet company’s growth, it is more of for solving problems in education for the next 20 years.
* Possible opportunity to solve education problem in Asia.
* Underlying culture will change and expose interesting opportunities in the long term.
* Angels will invest in education because they’re motivated by making a difference, not by making a big return in 5 years.
* Well educated people think about education as an investment. The average middle class person thinks about education as an expenditure.
* This means that educational companies that focus on delivering higher quality solutions to consumers will not scale to the mainstream. Educational companies built around driving down costs to the end consumer will scale.
Examples
* Chegg: Sells the same textbook experience, but for cheaper. Great consumer focused business with offering real savings to students.
* U of Phoenix: They make it easier to get a degree because it’s convenient. The government is footing the bill. They compete with the local university, not Harvard.
* Kaplan: Not quality of education, but convenience.
* K12: Sell to schools but it is about driving down costs.
* Tutorvista: Online tutoring to Western students using tutors in India at $99/month.
* Tutor.com: Online tutoring to the masses: never went mainstream, became a niche business.
* Early adopters behave fundamentally different than the mass market.
Being Asian or poor
* Asian Americans just believe in a better education.
* Since poor people’s default state is “screwed”, they need something dramatically better. So they try a lot of stuff.
* Khan academy demographics: People who are already well-educated and want resources, poor people, and Asian.
Statistics on Philippine Education
* 27/100 Pinoys have 25-64 have completed tertiary education, higher than Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, but many end up working as domestic helpers.
* Just 3.3% of the GDP is spent on education.
* Society is transforming from one that cherishes education to one which encourages singing and dancing.
* Proportion of Flips completing primary is just at 88-91%.
* 41st in math, 42nd in science (out of 45 countries).
* Annual salary of Flip teacher, regardless of experience: 9-11 PPP dollars.
