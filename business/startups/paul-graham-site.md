# The Power of the Marginal
--------------------------------------------------

Why do great ideas come from the margins?

## Insiders

- More outsiders than insiders.
- Selecting the wrong kind of people.
- Inability to take risks.
- Need to seem serious.
- Weight of expectations.
- Power of vested interests.
- *Work becomes a duty, rather than a pleasure.*

## Tests

- The problem with tests for selecting elites is that there are two ways to pass: to be good at what they try to measure, and to be good at hacking the test itself.
- First question to ask about a field: *How honest are its tests?* This tells you how much to trust your instincts when you disagree with the authorities, whether it's worth going through the usual channels to become one yourself, an perhaps whether you want to work on this field at all.
- Tests are least hackable when there are consistent standards for quality, and the people running the test really care about its integrity (PhD programs are less hackable than undergraduate admissions).
- *You're probably better off studying something moderately interesting with someone who's good at it than something very interesting with someone who isn't.*

## Anti-tests

- When the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt, most of the good people will be outsiders.
- If it's corrupt enough, a test becomes an anti-test, filtering out the people it should select by making them to do things only the wrong people would do. Ex: popularity in high school. *In the grownup world, rising up through the hierarchy of the average big company demands an attention to politics few thoughtful people could spare. Someone like Billomeone like Bill Gates can grow a company under him, but it's hard to imagine him having the patience to climb the corporate ladder at General Electric—or Microsoft, actually.*
- People at big companies don't realize the extent to which they live in an environment that is one large, ongoing test for the wrong qualities.
- If you're an outsider, your best chances for beating insiders are obviously in fields where corrupt tests select a lame elite. But there's a catch: if the tests are corrupt, your victory won't be recognized, at least in your lifetime.
- It can be worth participating in a corrupt contest, however, if it's followed by another that isn't corrupt. For example, it would be worth competing with a company that can spend more than you on marketing, as long as you can survive to the next round, when customers compare your actual products.

## Risk

- Outsiders have nothing to lose. The eminent are weighted down by their eminence.
- Being able to take risks is hugely valuable. Everyone values safety too much. No one wants to look like a fool. But it's very useful to be able to.
- *Lord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and character at its worst.*
- Tradition is less of a guide, not just because things change faster, but because the space of possibilities is so large. The more complicated the world gets, the more valuable it is to be willing to look like a fool.

## Delegation

- If you ask eminent people what's wrong with their lives, the first thing they'll complain about is the lack of time.
- The lives of the eminent become scheduled, and that's not good for thinking. One of the great advantages of being an outsider is long, uninterrupted blocks of time. That's what I remember about grad school: apparently endless supplies of time, which I spent worrying about, but not writing, my dissertation. Obscurity is like health food—unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you. Whereas fame tends to be like the alcohol produced by fermentation. When it reaches a certain concentration, it kills off the yeast that produced it.
- Is there a general rule for finding problems best solved in one head? Well, you can manufacture them by taking any project usually done by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself.
- Techniques for competing with delegation translate well into business, because delegation is endemic there. Instead of avoiding it as a drawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a sign of maturity. In big companies software is often designed, implemented, and sold by three separate types of people. In startups one person may have to do all three. And though this feels stressful, it's one reason startups win. The needs of customers and the means of satisfying them are all in one head.

## Focus

- The very skill of insiders can be a weakness. Once someone is good at something, they tend to spend all their time doing that. This kind of focus is very valuable, actually. Much of the skill of experts is the ability to ignore false trails. But focus has drawbacks: you don't learn from other fields, and when a new approach arrives, you may be the last to notice.
- For outsiders this translates into two ways to win. One is to work on a variety of things. Since you can't derive as much benefit (yet) from a narrow focus, you may as well cast a wider net and derive what benefit you can from similarities between fields.
- The second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks. In particular, new things. So if you're not good at anything yet, consider working on something so new that no one else is either.
- The Achilles heel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalize themselves. Many innovations consist of replacing something with a cheaper alternative, and companies just don't want to see a path whose immediate effect is to cut an existing source of revenue.
- So if you're an outsider you should actively seek out contrarian projects. Instead of working on things the eminent have made prestigious, work on things that could steal that prestige.

## Less

- The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large scale. Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums.
- Outsiders are free of all this. They can work on small things, and there's something very pleasing about small things. Small things can be perfect; big ones always have something wrong with them.
- Working on small things is also a good way to learn. The most important kinds of learning happen one project at a time. ("Next time, I won't...") The faster you cycle through projects, the faster you'll evolve.
- So if you're an outsider, take advantage of your ability to make small and inexpensive things. Cultivate the pleasure and simplicity of that kind of work; one day you'll miss it.

## Responsibility

- Responsibility is an occupational disease of eminence. In principle you could avoid it, just as in principle you could avoid getting fat as you get old, but few do.
- How does responsibility constrain you? The worst thing is that it allows you not to focus on real work.
- A lot of the pain of being an outsider is being aware of one's own procrastination. But this is actually a good thing. You're at least close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry.
- As an outsider, you're just one step away from getting things done. A huge step, admittedly, and one that most people never seem to make, but only one step. If you can summon up the energy to get started, you can work on projects with an intensity (in both senses) that few insiders can match. For insiders work turns into a duty, laden with responsibilities and expectations. It's never so pure as it was when they were young.

## Audience

- When I was in college I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors. But this wasn't what made them eminent—it was more a flaw their eminence had allowed them to sink into. Imitating it was like pretending to have gout in order to seem rich.
- What are the genuine advantages of being an insider? The greatest is an audience. It often seems to outsiders that the great advantage of insiders is money—that they have the resources to do what they want. But so do people who inherit money, and that doesn't seem to help, not as much as an audience. It's good for morale to know people want to see what you're making; it draws work out of you.
- Though the Web has been around for more than ten years, I think we're just beginning to see its democratizing effects. Outsiders are still learning how to steal audiences. But more importantly, audiences are still learning how to be stolen—they're still just beginning to realize how much deeper bloggers can dig than journalists, how much more interesting a democratic news site can be than a front page controlled by editors, and how much funnier a bunch of kids with webcams can be than mass-produced sitcoms.

## Hacking

- If I had to condense the power of the marginal into one sentence it would be: just try hacking something together. That phrase draws in most threads I've mentioned here. Hacking something together means deciding what to do as you're doing it, not a subordinate executing the vision of his boss. It implies the result won't be pretty, because it will be made quickly out of inadequate materials.
- Something hacked together means something that barely solves the problem, or maybe doesn't solve the problem at all, but another you discovered en route. But that's ok, because the main value of that initial version is not the thing itself, but what it leads to.
- The word "try" is an especially valuable component. I disagree here with Yoda, who said there is no try. There is try. It implies there's no punishment if you fail. You're driven by curiosity instead of duty. That means the wind of procrastination will be in your favor: instead of avoiding this work, this will be what you do as a way of avoiding other work.
- *If I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thing I'd do more of: just try hacking things together. Like many people that age, I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do. I also spent some time trying to build stuff. I should have spent less time worrying and more time building.*

## Inappropriate

- If you really want to score big, the place to focus is the margin of the margin: the territories only recently captured from the insiders. That's where you'll find the juiciest projects still undone, either because they seemed too risky, or simply because there were too few insiders to explore everything.
- Up till a few years ago, writing essays was the ultimate insider's game. Domain experts were allowed to publish essays about their field, but the pool allowed to write on general topics was about eight people who went to the right parties in New York.
- This leads to my final suggestion: a technique for determining when you're on the right track. You're on the right track when people complain that you're unqualified, or that you've done something inappropriate. If people are complaining, that means you're doing something rather than sitting around, which is the first step. And if they're driven to such empty forms of complaint, that means you've probably done something good.
- *If you make something and people complain that it doesn't work, that's a problem. But if the worst thing they can hit you with is your own status as an outsider, that implies that in every other respect you've succeeded. Pointing out that someone is unqualified is as desperate as resorting to racial slurs. It's just a legitimate sounding way of saying: we don't like your type around here.*
- *But the best thing of all is when people call what you're doing inappropriate. I've been hearing this word all my life and I only recently realized that it is, in fact, the sound of the homing beacon. "Inappropriate" is the null criticism. It's merely the adjective form of "I don't like it."*

How to Start a Startup?
--------------------------------------------------
## Start with good people, make something customers actually want, and spend as little money as possible.

# Idea

You don't need a brilliant idea, what you need is to offer people better technology than the ones they are using right now.

That's why online dating sucks: they think of dating as database matches instead of how it works in the real world.

NDA is fucking stupid. Ideas are worth something, but they’re not transferrable.

# People

You need to get people who take their work a little too seriously.

* *Sales:* Super tenacious.
* *Hacker:* Will not sleep until bug is dead.
* *Graphics:* Will feel physical pain if something is 2 mm out of place.

Programmers: were they genuinely smart, could they actually get things done, and could we stand their personalities? Remember that people who are smart do not need to act that they are smart.

Startups start around universities because that’s where smart people meet. What you should do in college is to work on your own projects. That’s the only way to learn how to program.

Founders should include technical people. Business people are bad at deciding what to do with technology because they don’t know what the options are.

Re: MBA, the things you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things. You’d need a business person though, to be able to focus on what customers want.

If you can’t understand users though, then learn how or find a co-founder who can.

# What Customers Want

A large percentage of restaurants fail (1/4 the first year). But restaurants with great food prospers, no matter what.

In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn’t want the product.

Prototyping is not necessarily the best way to write every program, but it’s the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certainly wrong, so your first priority should be to figure out where.

Trade shows didn’t pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research.

Higher chance to win in niche markets rather than big consumer brands. Find places where things suck real bad.

Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it’s easier to sell to them. It’s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them use a lot of time and money to do it.

In technology, it is easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.

# You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss
--------------------------------------------------

A normal may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour or sugar is for us physically.

Dunbar number thing. Bosses are there.

Corn syrup. There is a lack of individual initiative in a large organization.

It's especially hard for programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new things. This is the inevitable consequence of bigness. F legacy code. You will learn more in a startup.

# The Word "Hacker"
--------------------------------------------------

To programmers, "hacker" connotes mastery in the literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants, whether the computer wants it or not.

Disobedience is a byproduct of qualities that make them good programmers.

Hackers see aggressive measures to protect IP as a threat to the intellectual freedom they need to do their job, and they are right. It is by poking about inside current techology that hackers get ideas for the next generation.

Hackers are unruly. Silicon Balley is in America, because in the other countries, people color inside the lines.

Hackers are smart-alecks. It's odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical. Computers are precise and methodical. Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh.

To hackers, the recent contraction in civil liberties seems especially ominous. That must also mystify outsiders. Why should we care especially about civil liberties? Why programmers, more than dentists or salesmen or landscapers?

I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people. Authoritarian countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. This is why hackers worry. The government spying on people doesn't literally make programmers write worse code. It just leads eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.


# What Startups Are Really Like
--------------------------------------------------
1. *Be Cafeful with Cofounders.* What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character and commitment, not ability. This was particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don't pick cofounders who will flake.

2. *Startups Take Over Your Life.* Running a startup is not like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens.

3. *It's an Emotional Roller-coaster.* "The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me. One day, we'd think of ourselves as the next Google and dream of buying islands; the next, we'd be pondering how to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on."

4. *It Can Be Fun.* I'm surprised by how much better it feels to be working on something that is challenging and creative, something I believe in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before. I knew it would feel better; what's surprising is how much better.

5. *Persistence Is the Key.* "Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but going through it made me realize that the determination required was still understated." "I've been surprised again and again by just how much more important persistence is than raw intelligence."

6. *Think Long-Term.* "I'm continually surprised by how long everything can take. Assuming your product doesn't experience the explosive growth that very few products do, everything from development to dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer than I always imagine." There is a positive side to thinking longer-term. It's not just that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than it should. If you work patiently it's less stressful, and you can do better work.

7. *Lots of Little Things.* "It's much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic insight."

	Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming. You won't get to, unless you fail. Which can be transformed into: If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.

	"I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to bring you success. It is never a single thing. Everything is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of those things until you strike something."

8. *Start with Something Minimal.* Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a complete application and ship it.

9. *Engage Users.* "I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments, and those that have a market show promising results extremely quickly."

(not yet finished)

# Raising Money
--------------------------------------------------
To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it’s hard to switch from that to a product company.

*Seed money* is used to pay for your living expenses while creating a prototype. You get these from angels. They know that this has to be decided on quickly. You sometimes don’t even need a business plan.

To get money, you should actually be a company, who will fix the incorporation and stock divisions.

Make sure that you do not have existing things that you have signed re: IP, such as the type that you have to have your thing owned by another company.

*Remember that most rich people are looking for good investments.* To them, if you show up and say there’s a high chance of success, then you’re doing them a favor by letting them invest.

Next round: VCs. Approach them in advance because they can take months to decide. I’m inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.

Talk to as many VCs as you can, because they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, or if they are impressed, then they won’t invest in your competitors.

# Not Spending It

Try to not spend money as much as possible. Google knew that and they knew that brand is worth next to nothing in search, so they never did any advertising.

There is nothing more valuable in an early stage of a startup than smart users. If you listen to them, they’ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product, and they’ll even pay you for it.

*VC money is not revenue.* It’s money investors have given you in the hope you’ll be able to generate revenues. That money is not yours.

When looking for a space for a startup, don’t feel that it has to look professional. *Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls.* Just rent an apartment¬–you want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?

Key hours for productivity are the hours after dinner–employees eat dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them.

The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. They are a recurring expense and they slow you down.

So who should start a startup: a good hacker, between 23-38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid over gradually over a conventional working life. Greater than 23 because you need to see what’s in an existing business before you try running your own. VCs also won’t take you more seriously. Less than 38 because it's demanding physically (few sleep) and you might have more obligations at that point (family).

Lessons: Don’t have a lot of meetings, don’y have chunks of code that multiple people own, don’t have a sales guy running the company, don’t make a high-end product, don’t let your code get too big, don’t leave finding bugs to QA people, don’t go too long between releases, don’t isolate developers from users.

*Understand that for the next 4 years, you’ll do nothing but work. If you aren’t working, your competitors will be.*

# How to Raise Money
--------------------------------------------------
Most startups that raise money do it more than once. Usually, you start with a few tends of thousands from something like Y Combinator, then raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then raise another round to accelerate growth.

It’s hard to convince people to part with large sums of money.

It’s hard to raise because it’s an alien world to most founders.

Investors are pinched between: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing out on startups that take off. The cause of all this fear: the fact that the successful startups grow very fast.

Don’t raise money unless you want it and it wants you. You need the money only for rapid growth.

Be in fundraising mode or not. Fundraising is super distracting because it becomes the top idea in your mind.

Always talk to them in parallel rather than serially. The biggest factor in most investors’ opinions of you is the opinion of other investors.

Don’t  get investors who say “I want to invest in you but I don’t lead” because that means “no, except yes if you turn out to be a hot deal”.

Pick just one guy to handle fundraising.

# How to Convince Investors
--------------------------------------------------
In startups, as in a lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power law, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep.
You need three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually) some evidence of success so far.

# Formidable

Most investors decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change.

They're not necessarily trying to mislead you. Most investors are genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike startups.

A formidable person is one who seems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever obstacles are in the way. Formidable is close to confident, except that someone could be confident and mistaken. Formidable is roughly justifiably confident.

What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more experienced founders. Investors are not always that good at judging technology, but they're good at judging confidence.

# Truth

The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth.

Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll believe you.

I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn't, don't try to raise money.

To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert. If you're not a domain expert, you can be as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach some artificial deadline like a Demo Day. It's when you can convince investors, and not before.

But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you from wasting your time.
 
# Market

Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors think of them as markets.

# Rejection

The most common question you'll get from investors will be "who else is investing?"

The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve this problem by giving investors the impression that while no investors have committed yet, several are about to.

Experienced investors are well aware that the best ideas are also the scariest.

Because the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and the best startup ideas look initially like bad ideas, it's not uncommon for a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.

# Different

And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language you used to convince yourself. You wouldn't use vague, grandiose marketing-speak among yourselves. Don't use it with investors either.

# Fundraising
--------------------------------------------------
Biggest cause of death for a startup: Dying because they didn't make what people want. Second: difficulty of raising money.

#Why is it hard to sell/raise?
- Brutality of markets. Cx doesn't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved their problems.
- Fewer than cx.
- Invstors are random: all investors are by ordinary standards incompetent.
- A ton of money is at stake, usually.

# Tipz
- _Have low expectations._ Deals fall through.
- _Keep working on your startup._
- _Be conservative._ Approach fundraising as if it were always going badly.
- _Be flexible._ Know how much money to raise for survival, for getting office space/hiring people from school. Try to make a small round initially and expand when needed.
- _Be independent._ Investors like it when you're ramen profitable, because it shows you've thought about making money, instead of working on amusing and technical problems.
- _Don't take rejection personally._ VCs reject practically everyone lol. When you get a rejection, use the data that's in it, no waht's not.
- _Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate)._
- _Avoid inexperienced investors._
- _Know where you stand._ Investors are indecisive. They tend to resist committing except to the extent you push them to. It's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of info while making the minimum amount of decisions.

# Nerds
--------------------------------------------------
Being smart doesn’t make you an outcast in elementary school, not in the real world. But why does it make you an outcast in middle/high school?

All things equal, kids preferred being smarter than average, but it counted far less than physical appearance, charisma, or athletic ability. I think this is because the smart ones didn’t even want to be popular. I wanted to be popular, but not as how much I wanted to be smart.

*To nerds, the thought of average intelligence would be unbearable.*

Teenagers are always on duty as conformists. Nerds don’t realize that it takes work to be popular. It’s something that you make yourself. Nerds are unpopular because they have other things to think about. *Popular kids learned to be popular in the same way that smart kids learned to be smart: from their parents.*

This is why their lives suck from 11-17. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after.

# Why does persecution happen?

* Teenagers are still half-children, and many children are intrinsically cruel.
* People want to feel better by putting other people down.
* To become more popular, you want to bring yourself closer to other popular people, and nothing brings people close than a common enemy. You can create an enemy.
* Most persecution comes from the middle classes, because the most popular don’t need to stoop to such things.
* Kids also lose points from hanging out with nerds.

Adults know abstractly that kids are monstrously cruel to each other, but not really. Teachers are more of for keeping children in the grounds, not for keeping them in line.

For the real world, it’s not because “adults are more mature.” Adults in prison pick on one another. In the real world, there are repercussions for doing bad things. In school/prison, there is a bubble where everything is contained.

Schools are holding pens within a fake world: they keep kids locked up so adults can get things done. Which is okay except that the kids are forced to memorize facts and like football. And hating this means you’re a misfit.

# Is It Worth Being Wise?
--------------------------------------------------

What is wisdom? I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of situations. I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word. A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.

"Wise" and "smart" are both ways of saying someone knows what to do. The difference is that "wise" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and "smart" means one does spectacularly well in a few.

The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its worst. Except you judge intelligence at its best, and wisdom by its average. So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could.

This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept: there's no such thing. "Wise" means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice. But giving the name "wisdom" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't mean such a thing exists. To the extent "wisdom" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy.

Perhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to intelligence is not the same as intelligence. But it's an important technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter, just as we can become wiser.

In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we do. Distinguishing between "wise" and "smart" is a modern habit. [5] And the reason we do is that they've been diverging. As knowledge gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper, like a digital image rendered with more pixels.

Society seems to have voted for intelligence. We no longer admire the sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago. Now we admire the genius. Because in fact the distinction we began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart. That doesn't sound especially admirable. That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math.

Recently I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the ancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well as you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience, and then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could.

To me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it. If I was any good, why didn't I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have? But that, I now believe, is like a runner asking "If I'm such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?" Good runners still get tired; they just get tired at higher speeds.

People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same position as the runner. There's no way for them to do the best they can, because there's no limit to what they could do. The closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people. But the better you do, the less this matters.

Whereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives, there's an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every time.

But as knowledge has grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded. Intelligence has become increasingly important relative to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.

Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom is how different their recipes are. Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from cultivating them.


o achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff. Both self-control and experience have this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively. That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it. Much of what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year old. The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old it's mixed together with a lot of random junk.

The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems. You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through exercise. But there can't be too much compulsion here. No amount of discipline can replace genuine curiosity. So cultivating intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's character—some tendency to be interested in certain types of things—and nurturing it.

Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps one reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence using recipes for wisdom. Most recipes for wisdom have an element of subjection. At the very least, you're supposed to do what the teacher says. The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does. But that's not the route to intelligence. Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep working. Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.

A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to come up with things on their own, but you can't simply applaud everything they produce. You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed. And that's a lot of work. You have to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised.

These two senses of "knowing what to do" are more different than most people realize. The path to wisdom is through discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected self-indulgence. Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time leads to discontentment.

That's particularly worth remembering. A physicist friend recently told me half his department was on Prozac. Perhaps if we acknowledge that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds of work, we can mitigate its effects. Perhaps we can box it up and put it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow together with everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly large pool. At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about being discontented.

# Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas
--------------------------------------------------

 We expected to divide them into two categories, promising and unpromising. But we soon saw we needed a third: promising people with unpromising ideas.

It's very common for a group of founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves did.

In January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called Artix. The plan was to put art galleries on the Web. In retrospect, I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid. Galleries are not especially excited about being on the Web even now, ten years later. They don't want to have their stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store.

Really good software is not written according to some design methodology, it's software that does something fabulous. If you're trying to do something fvulous, you wouldn't write something in a lousy way.

Programmer vs. developer: The kind of person who uses them. Engineer = Used in big companies. Developer = Slightly less. Hackers = What they call themselves. Programmers = Generic.

"Bad" hacker is also like "good" hacker, it means you are sneaky and you're doing what you are not supposed to do. Sometimes the difference is whether what they're doing is illegal or not.

# What You'll Wish You'd Known
--------------------------------------------------

At HS, you don't need to know what you want to do with your life yet. The first priority is to learn what the options were. You don't need to be in a rush to choose you're life's work. Discover what shit you like.

The problem with the "don't give up on your dreams" thing is that it's as if you already know what your dreams are. It's premature optimization.

Don't think that you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.

If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy.

Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway.

In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there? I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.

It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.

The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.

Most people like to be good at what they do. In the so-called real world this need is a powerful force. But high school students rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do. When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to be a high school student. And so I let my need to be good at what I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.

If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It's that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.

When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time. If you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most later, that's probably it.

Some people say this is inevitable-- that high school students aren't capable of getting anything done yet. But I don't think this is true. And the proof is that you're bored. You probably weren't bored when you were eight.

I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends-- that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal. No matter how much you like chocolate cake, you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it. And that's what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness. [5]

We have to have extracurricular activities. But you know perfectly well how bogus most of these are. Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not hard. It's not getting something done. What I mean by getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life. This sort of thing rarely translates into a line item on a college application.

Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.

And what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in? The word "aptitude" is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired tastes.

A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture under the name "passion." I recently saw an ad for waiters saying they wanted people with a "passion for service." The real thing is not something one could have for waiting on tables. And passion is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.

Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid curiosity. Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at random about everything. In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely. It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always asking why about everything. But in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep. The mud flat morphs into a well.

Curiosity turns work into play. For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.

One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline.

I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.

Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.

If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. The critical moment for Einstein was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell is going on here?

When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it interesting. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting. People who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious.

And not only in intellectual matters. Henry Ford's great question was, why do cars have to be a luxury item? What would happen if you treated them as a commodity? Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect, why does everyone have to stay in his position? Why can't defenders score goals too?

If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one. Great questions don't appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head. And what makes them congeal is experience. So the way to find great questions is not to search for them-- not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd have made it.

The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost. Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe. They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys. So when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to notice it.

Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question. Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)

Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to. Closely related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen year olds aren't supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing no worse than expectations.

Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. And you don't have to wait to start. In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult. There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age.

This may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.

The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.

# Notes

The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant things. And especially about what other people thought of them.

I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what random people thought of them. Adults care just as much what other people think, but they get to be more selective about the other people.

I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about, and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me. The problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect for their judgement.

Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults. I wonder if they'd like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults. If you actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the reaction of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time. To say nothing of the things you're taught. If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration.

## How to Get Startup Ideas
[Reference](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)

- Best startup ideas:
  - Something the founders want.
  - They themselves can build.
  - Few others realize this is worth doing.
- There have to be users who really need what they're making, not just people who can see themselves using this one day.
- Better to have something that people really need than a lot of people not really needing the thing that much.
- Live in the future, then build what's missing.
- Ex: Dropbox, people forgot their USB sticks.
- Noticing startup ideas: look for things that seem to be missing.
- Work on projects that seem like they'd be cool.

# Life is Short
[Reference](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)

- Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. 52 weekends per year, 8 Christmases with your kid if from the ages 3-10.
- Life is too short for BS:
  - Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.
  - These things are either forced or you get tricked into joining them.
  - If you prioritize bullshit avoidance, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.
- What's hard to avoid: things that are tricked into your life.
  - Ex: arguing online.
  - Ex: caring what other people think. Nearly all adults say that they cared too much what other kids thought of them.
- ***Do you actually care about this in the future?*** Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.
  - The things that mater aren't necessarily the ones people would call important: having coffee with a friend matters.
- Cultivate a sense of impatience about the things you want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mom. Just don't wait.
- ***When you don't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.***
- How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.
- Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.
