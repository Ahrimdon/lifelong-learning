## The Beginner's Guide to SEO

#### 1—How Search Engines Operate
- SEO is the practice of improving and promoting a web site in order to increase the number of visitors the site receives from search engines.
- Through links, search engines’ automated robots, called “crawlers,” or “spiders” can reach the many billions of interconnected documents.
- Currently, the major engines typically interpret importance as popularity – the more popular a site, page or document, the more valuable the information contained therein must be.

#### Google
- Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines. Don't deceive your users or present different content to search engines than you display to users, which is commonly referred to as cloaking.
- Make a site with a clear hierarchy and text links. Every page should be reachable from at least one static text link.
- Make sure that your title elements and ALT attributes are descriptive and accurate.
- Use keywords to create descriptive, human friendly URLs. Provide one version of a URL to reach a document, using 301 redirects or the rel="canonical" element to address duplicate content.

#### Bing
- Ensure a clean, keyword rich URL structure is in place.
- Make sure content is not buried inside rich media (Adobe Flash Player, JavaScript, Ajax) and verify that rich media doesn't hide links from crawlers.
- Create keyword-rich content based on research to match what users are searching for. Produce fresh content regularly.
- Through methods like patent analysis, experiments, and live testing, search marketers as a community have come to understand many of the basic operations of search engines and the critical components of creating websites and pages that earn high rankings and significant traffic.
 
#### 2—How People Interact with Search Engines
- When users have a bad experience at your site, when they can't accomplish a task or find what they were looking for, this often correlates with poor search engine performance.
- Search queries:

	- "Do" Transactional Queries - Action queries such as buy a plane ticket or listen to a song.
	- "Know" Informational Queries - When a user seeks information, such as the name of the band or the best restaurant in New York City.
	- "Go" Navigation Queries - Search queries that seek a particular online destination, such as Facebook or the homepage of the NFL.

#### 3—Why Search Engine Marketing is Necessary
- Common argument: “Anyone with half a brain would want a system that can crawl through any architecture, parse any amount of complex or imperfect code and still find a way to return the best and most relevant results, not the ones that have been "optimized" by unlicensed search marketing experts.”
- However, search engines interpret things differently from people, ex: pictures.

#### Limitations
- Spidering and Indexing Problems: Websites created using a CMS often create duplicate versions of the same page.
- Content to Query Matching: "Food cooling units" vs "refrigerators". Target your location.
- The "Tree Falls in a Forest": You can build a perfect website, but its content can remain invisible to search engines unless you promote it.
- In 2011, social media marketing and vertical search inclusion are mainstream methods for conducting search engine optimization.
 
#### 4—The Basics of Search Engine Friendly Design & Development
- In order to be listed in the search engines, your most important content should be in HTML text format.
- Images in gif, jpg, or png format can be assigned “alt attributes” in HTML, providing search engines a text description of the visual content.
- Search boxes can be supplemented with navigation and crawlable links.
- Flash or Java plug-in contained content can be supplemented with text on the page.
- Video & audio content should have an accompanying transcript if the words and phrases used are meant to be indexed by the engines.
- An unreachable page means G's spider won't reach it.

#### Why pages may not be reachable
- Submission-required forms: If you require users to complete an online form before accessing certain content, chances are search engines may never see those protected pages. Search spiders do not submit forms.
- Links in un-parseable Javascript: If you use Javascript for links, you may find that search engines either do not crawl or give very little weight to the links embedded within.
- Links pointing to pages blocked by the meta robots tag or robots.txt: The Meta Robots tag and the Robots.txt file both allow a site owner to restrict spider access to a page.
- Frames or I-frames: Technically, links in both frames and I-Frames are crawlable, but both present structural issues for the engines in terms of organization and following.
- Robots don't use search forms: Some webmasters believe if they place a search box on their site, then engines will be able to find everything that visitors search for. Unfortunately, spiders don't perform searches to find content.
- Links in flash, java, or other plug-ins
- Links on pages with many hundreds or thousands of links: Search engines will only crawl so many links on a given page - not an infinite amount.
- rel="nofollow": Add this is you don't want engines to find your link.
 
#### Keywords
- In the early days, search engines relied on keyword usage as a prime relevancy signal, regardless of how the keywords were actually used. Today, although search engines still can't read and comprehend text as well as a human, the use of machine learning has allowed them to get closer to this ideal.
- If your page targets the keyword phrase "Eiffel Tower" then you might naturally include content about the Eiffel Tower itself, the history of the tower, or even recommended Paris hotels. On the other hand, if you simply sprinkle the words "Eiffel Tower" onto a page with irrelevant content, such as a page about dog breeding, then your efforts to rank for "Eiffel Tower" will be a long, uphill battle.
- Keyword density is not a part of modern ranking algorithms.

#### KW Usage Recommendations
- Use the keyword in the title tag at least once. Try to keep the keyword as close to the beginning of the title tag as possible.
- Once prominently near the top of the page.
- At least 2-3 times, including variations, in the body copy on the page - sometimes a few more if there's a lot of text content.
- At least once in the alt attribute of an image on the page.
- Once in the URL. Additional rules for URLs and keywords are discussed later on in this section.
- At least once in the meta description tag. Note that the meta description tag does NOT get used by the engines for rankings, but rather helps to attract clicks by searchers from the results page, as it is the "snippet" of text used by the search engines.
- Generally not in link anchor text on the page itself that points to other pages on your site or different domains.

#### Title Tags
- Search engines display only the first 65-75 characters of a title tag in the search results.
- Place important keywords close to the front.
- Leverage branding at the end.
- Consider readability and emotional impact must have compelling impact since it is the first interaction with your brand.
 
#### Meta Robots
- index/noindex tells the engines whether the page should be crawled and kept in the engines' index for retrieval.
- follow/nofllow: <meta name ="robots" content="no index, nofllow">, engines will disregard the links o0n the page both for discovery and ranking purposes
- noarchive: restrict SEs from saving a cached copy.
- nosnippet: refrain from displaying  descriptive block of text next to the page's title and URL in the search results.
- noodp/noydir: shit

#### Meta Description
- Length: 160 characters, used for snippets.
URL Structures
- Since search engines display URLs in the results, they can impact click-through and visibility.
- URLs make an appearance in the web browser's address bar, and while this generally has little impact on search engines, poor URL structure and design can result in negative user experiences.
- If you can easily and accurately predict the content you'd expect to find on the page, your URLs are appropriately descriptive. If your page is targeting a specific term or phrase, make sure to include it in the URL. However, don't go overboard
- Shorter is better
- If your page is targeting a specific term or phrase, make sure to include it in the URL. However, don't go overboard.
- mod_rewrite to change http://moz.com/blog?id=123 into a more readable static version like this: http://moz.com/blog/google-fresh-factor.
- Use hyphens to separate words
Duplicate content
- Search engines have cracked down on "thin" and duplicate content through penalties and lower rankings.
- For example, you offer a regular version of a page and a "print optimized" version of the same content.
- <link rel=”canonical” href=”http://moz.com/blog”/>, tells SEs to treat as though the page was a copy of the URL.
- Structured data: cool
 
#### Anti-scraping
- This practice of fetching your content and re-publishing is called "scraping," and the scrapers make remarkably good earnings by outranking sites for their own content and displaying ads.
- When you publish content in any type of feed format - RSS/XML/etc - make sure to ping the major blogging/tracking services (like Google, Technorati, Yahoo!, etc.).
- Use their laziness: use absolute, rather that relative links in your internal linking structure. Thus, rather than linking to your home page using: <a href="http://moz.com">Home</a> instead of <a href="../>Home</a>

#### 5—Keyword Research

- Will searchers find what they are looking on your site when they search using these keywords?
- Understanding which websites already rank for your keyword gives you valuable insight into the competition.
- If your website doesn't rank for the keyword, you can nonetheless buy "test" traffic to see how well it converts. In Google Adwords, choose "exact match" and point the traffic to the relevant page on your website.
- Using the data you’ve collected, determine the exact value of each keyword.
- Long tail of keyword demand: 70% of all searches are in the long tail of the search. "shoes", not good. "best price on Air Jordan size 12", better.
6—Usability, UX, Content
- Easy to use, provide direct info, professionally designed/accessible to major browsers, high quality, legit content
- Thus, in order to understand content they rely on meta information (not necessarily meta tags) about sites and pages in order to rank content.
- Users: No one likes to link to a crummy site.
Signs of Quality Content:
- Engagement Metrics: Search engines have sought the "long click" - where users click a result without immediately returning to the search page to try again.
- Machine Learning: Training set of human evals,then Google did it.
- The timing, source, anchor text, and number of links to the new site are all factored into its potential performance (i.e., ranking) for relevant queries at the engines.
Search Intents
- Transactional: Identifying a local business, making a purchase online and completing a task. "Greek restaurant in Flemington, NJ"
- Navigational: Visiting a pre-determined destination and sourcing the “correct” website URL. "Alaskan Airlines flight"
- Informational Searches: Researching non-transactional information, getting quick answers and ego-searching. "Actor who played Wash from Firefly".
7—Growing Popularity and Links
- Trustworthy sites tend to link to other trusted sites, while spammy sites receive very few links from trusted sources.
Signals used by SEs
- The more popular and important a site is, the more links from that site matter.
- Links from sites within a topic-specific community matter more than links from general or off-topic sites.
- Anchor text is very important.
- TrustRank: From high-trust domains such as universities, gov't websites.
- It's important not only to earn links to your website, but also to continue to earn additional links over time.
- Although there is evidence that social shares such as Tweets, Likes, and Plusses affect rankings, at this time links are considered a far superior and more lasting way to promote the popularity of your content than any other method.
Link Building Strategies
- Get your customers to link to you.
- Build a company blog. Make it a valuable, informative and entertaining resource.
- Create content that inspires viral sharing and natural linking
- Be newsworthy.
- Find directories or listings of relevant resources.

- XML for SEs to understand.
- Robots.txt : File included on the website's root which gives instructions to automated crawlers visiting your wite.
- rel="nofollow", rel="canonical"

All Links are Not Created Equal: 10 Illustrations on Search Engines' Valuation of Links
PageRank principles
- Links on the web can be interpreted as votes that are cast by the source for the target
- All votes are, initially, considered equal
- Over the course of executing the algorithm on a link graph, pages which receive more votes become more important
- More important pages cast more important votes
- The votes a page can cast are a function of that page's importance, divided by the number of votes/links it casts
Tips
- Links Higher Up in HTML Code Cast More Powerful Votes
- External Links are More Influential than Internal Links
- Links from Unique Domains Matter More than Links from Previously Linking Sites
- Links From Sites Closer To A Trusted Seed Set Pass More Value
- Links from "Inside" Unique Content Pass More Value than Those from Footers/Sidebar/Navigation
- Keywords in HTML Text Pass More Value than those in Alt Attributes of Linked Images
- Links from More Important, Popular, Trusted Sites Pass More Value (even from less important pages)
- Links Contained Within NoScript Tags Pass Lower (and Possibly No) Value
- A Burst of New Links May Enable a Document to Overcome "Stronger" Competition Temporarily (or in Perpetuity)
- Pages that Link to WebSpam May Devalue the Other Links they Host
 
Google's SEO Starter Guide
Title Tag
- Create a unique title for each page on your site.
- Title tag will appear in the first time of results.
Best practices
- Describe the page's content.
- Use brief but descriptive titles. Don't stuff unneeded keywords in your title tags
Description meta tag
- Appears underneath the keyword when searching.
Best practices
- Do not use generic descriptions ("page about business cards")
- Do not copy and paste the document's content into the description meta tag.
- Have a different description meta tag for each page.

 
Improve the structure of your URLs
- It could also lead to better crawling of your documents by search engines.
- Also, it can create easier, "friendlier" URLs for those that want to link to your content.
- If your URL contains relevant words, this provides users and search engines with more information about the page than an ID or oddly named parameter would.
Best practices
- Use words in URLs.
- Provide one version of a URL to reach a document.
- Avoid: deep nesting.
- Avoid: having pages from subdomains and the root directory access the same content (domain.com/page, sub.domain.com/page)
- Avoid: odd capitalization of URLs.
- Use a text browser, such as Lynx, to examine your site. Most spiders see your site much as Lynx would.
- Don't feel obligated to purchase a search engine optimization service. While legitimate consulting firms can improve your site's flow and content, others employ deceptive tactics in an attempt to fool search engines.
- Use 301 redirect to redirect users from old sites to the new. The 301 status code means that a page has permanently moved to a new location.
Make your site easier to navigate
- Search engines navigate your site using your file structure.
- You should think about how visitors will go from a general page (your root page) to a page containing more specific content.
- Allow for the possibility of a part of the URL being removed: Some users navigate your website like this.
- He or she might be visiting http://www.brandonsbaseballcards.com/news/?010/upcoming-baseball-card-shows.htm, but then enter http://www.brandonsbaseballcards.com/news/?010/ into the browser's address bar, believing that this will show all news from 2010.
- A site map (lower-case) is a simple page on your site that displays the structure of your website, and usually consists of a hierarchical listing of the pages on your site. Visitors may visit this page if they are having problems finding pages on your site.
- An XML Sitemap (upper-case) file, which you can submit through Google's Webmaster Tools, makes it easier for Google to discover the pages on your site.

Best Social Media Metrics
http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/best-social-media-metrics-conversation-amplification-applause-economic-value/
- What actually matters in social media? Not the number of friends, or the number of posts, or the followers-following ratio. What matters is everything that happens after you post/tweet/participate!
Conversation Rate
- # of Audience Comments (or Replies) Per Post
- A high conversation rate requires a deeper understanding of who your audience is, what your brand attribute are, what you are good at, what value you can add to your followers and the ecosystem you participate in.
Amplification Rate
- Think that the unique people who follow the people who follow you is a lot greater than your initial followers.
- Twitter: Amplification = # of retweets per tweet
- Facebook: # of shares per post
- Blog, Youtube: # of share clicks per post
- What you want is for your 2nd degrees to be 1st degrees.
Applause Rate
- Twitter: # of favorites, Facebook: # of likes, Google Plus: # of +1s, blog: # of +1s
Economic Value
- A small percent of the people in your company/brand will come to your main company website and choose to do business with you. Those are all macro and micro conversions. With these, you can measure economic value.
Economic value = Sum of short and long term revenue and cost savings.
