- On the Lambda School
  - Tech: Salesforce, and moving away from MailChimp because it's not very robust for the drip email campaigns we need to be doing.
  - Growth activities: Hardest thing is to convince people that this isn't a scam. Redesign, trust building (student testimonials, 3rd party articles from new publications, make sure the companies that our instructors worked at are known).
  - Because of the 6 months commitment, we have a free trial (Web Development 101 course).
  - Funnel: we spend a lot of money on advertising, Facebook, AdWords, Youtube, influencers, Quora.
- Reaching out to influencers:
  - Aggregating companies like `Intellinfluence`.
  - Direct message and mentioning the person in the comments.
- Selling a physical product:
  - Trust building: multiple touches with a buyer before they are ready to commit.
  - Product you can sell at break even to get them comfortable to purchase from you, before spending a lot on a higher priced item?
  - Send emails educating them on the value of using so-and-so.
  - Animations to show how it can overpower odors to leave a clean smell.
- B2B: sales cycle is longer and the sales process is higher touch.
- Cold outreach:

Thanks,

- If you post on community like Reddit, you can use the same approach. "I created this, but am trying to get feedback." Just be careful here because a lot of these people might give bad feedback, and might not be your target audience.
- 1-2 hours per week?
  - 1 hour a week writing really quality content that is relevant to my desired customers
  - 1 hour a week participating in communities related to my project, looking for opportunities to promote my product and content
- Indie Hackers can complete in just about any space they want to: the biggest factor to success is constant effort.
- How do Facebook marketers that were cloaking to sell skin creams/diet pills.
- Content marketing: there is a lot of effort involved in this.
- Pomodoro with Analytics:
  - This space is really big for content marketing: people are always looking for ways to increase productivity, and they search for articles about that.
  - Resources surrounded around different productivity methods.
  - Find lists of Pomodoro trackers online and see if they would be willing to add your tracker to the list.
  - Subreddits.
  - Referral program?
  - Think about the types of people who are interested in productivity. Think about where you can market to these groups of people online and reach out to them.
  - Cross post blog posts to Medium (`rel=canonical`). Medium must have a canonical URL pointing to your website.
- 5 day drip email course.
- **I think there's a lot of value in writing super high quality and in-depth content for a blog, and in building an email list. Those are two things every entrepreneur should be doing and utilizing in their marketing efforts.**
- Low hanging fruit:
  - Relevant subreddits.
  - Facebook groups.
  - Friends and family.
  - Post to my social media accounts.
  - Referrals from acquired users.
- When spending money on user acquisition, know that you are paying for data.
- Webinars and PDFs, and you have to discover if these worked for coders or for executives.
