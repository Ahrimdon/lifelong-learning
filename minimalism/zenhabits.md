## The Minimalist Principle: Omit Needless Things
[Reference](https://zenhabits.net/the-minimalist-principle-omit-needless-things/)

- **Possessions.** Whittle down to a minimum for the life you want to lead.
- **Buying.** Be content with life, not stuff, and thereby reducing your needs. Only buy what you need.
- **Eating.** Omit needless food, and make everything you eat count--make your food nutrient-dense, fiber dense, healthy and filling.
- **Doing.** Look at your to-do list and see what's really important. Omit needless activity.
- **Goals.** Can we do with just a few or even one? By focusing on less, you can really pour yourself into it.
- **What you produce.**  Make websites more focused. One call to action.
