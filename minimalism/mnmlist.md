## mnmlist: minimalism, the quick method

You just do and buy less.

Will all the stuff in your life instantly disappear? No, of course not – you’ll still need to chuck all your stuff. You’ll need to get out of all your commitments, and start simplifying your schedule and to-do list.

## mnmlist: beat advertising

The reason advertising works on most of us is that we feel there is something missing, that if we could only do or have X we could be happier, that we need whatever happiness they’re offering.

If instead we could find completeness, find happiness, find contentedness … advertising wouldn’t work. We’d say, “Thanks, but pass.”

You have everything you need for happiness, right now. The typical desires for more money, a nicer house and car, nicer clothes and gadgets, a big-screen TV, a super-successful career or business, etc. … none of that will get you happiness.

Happiness is simple pleasures, is spending time doing what you love and spending time with those you love.

> Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you. - Lao Tzu

## rethinking necessities

- A car: If you live in a place with a decent transportation system, not needed.
- Meat. Just do it slowly, one day per week?
- Lots of clothes.
- House. Few shit = small house.

## minimal web

What we need: The text of an article, including headline, a good-sized, readable font, a column width optimal for reading, and perhaps the name of the site for context, and minimal navigation.

What to leave out: Ads, cookies, tracking, popups, sharing buttons, comments, multiple pages/slides per article, Facebook/other social widgets, a widget showing recent comments or tweets, tags or related posts, syndicated content, something screaming for the reader to sign up for your newsletter.

Also: Minimal images, logo of the site in CSS, not image, small page weight, short URLs.

The person coming to your site isn’t a customer, a potential mailing list subscriber, a consumer of advertising, a person who wants to be marketed to, a buyer of your affiliate products, a Facebook or Twitter follower … he’s a person who simply wants some information or entertainment from what you’ve written.

When you create an amazing reading experience for the reader, he or she will appreciate it. The reader will love your great content (I hope), and then decide whether to bookmark it, email it, share it, subscribe, whatever. But without the reading experience, all the rest isn’t happening.

All the other stuff is distracting. It detracts from the experience. Sure, maybe it’ll help you reach your goals as a writer/site creator, but it doesn’t help the reader reach her goals. So if you put the distractions in to meet your goals, what message are you sending? That your goals are more important than those of the person who has graciously consented to come to your site and give you the gift of her attention.

Comments: They detract from the reading experience. They're not necessary for reading. Good discussion of the post can be continued elsewhere.

Subscriptions: Short-term, yes, but long-term: How much did you delight the reader? How many readers did you lose because you disrespected them with a popup?

Sharing: They will share the article if it s actually good.

Making Money: Just build an audience by being useful and trustworthy, then help with books, courses, software, a service.
