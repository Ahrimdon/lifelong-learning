## Structured Procrastination

- Procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators do marginally useful things, like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it. *They do this because they are a way of not doing something important. A procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely, and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important.*
- Important tasks are at top, but there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list. *Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list.*
- If you have a few tasks on your list, they will by definition be the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.
- *Top of the list: They seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't), and they seem important (but really aren't).*
- One needs to be able to recognize and commit oneself to tasks with inflated importance and unreal deadlines, while making oneself feel that they are important and urgent.
