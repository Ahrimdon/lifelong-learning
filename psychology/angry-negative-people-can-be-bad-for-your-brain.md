# Angry/negative people can be bad for your brain

## Mirror Neurons

These activate in the same way when you're watching someone else do something as they do when you're doing it yourself. We learn from watching others. We learn from imitating others.

"Choose your role models carefully", "Watching Michael Jordan will help you get better", "Watch the experts". The behaviors of others we're around is nearly irresistible (and we get to do it pretty unconsciously).

When Robert wants to spend time hanging around "happy people" and keeping his distance from "deeply unhappy" people, he's keeping his brain from making--over the long term--negative structural and chemical changes.

*If you want to accomplish something that demands determination and endurance, try to surround yourself with people possessing these qualities. And try to limit the time you spend with people given to pessimism and expressions of futility. Unfortunately, negative emotions exert a more powerful effect in social situations than positive ones, thanks to the phenomena of emotional contagion."*

## Emotional Contagion

*"Anger and resentment are thet most contagious of emotions," according to Stonsy. "If you are near a resentful or angry person, you are more prone to become resentful or angry yourself. If one driver engages in angry gestures and takes on the facial expressions of hostility, surrounding drivers will unconsciously imitate the behavior--resulting in an escalation of anger and resentment in all of the drivers. Added to this, the drivers are now more easily startled as a result of the outpouring of adrenaline accompanying their anger. The result is a temper tantrum that can easily escalate into road rage."*

We respect for physical biological contagions, but we do not have much respect for physical emotional contagions. (Emotions represent literal physical changes in the brain.)

"Beliefs and behaviour can indeed spread through populations as if they were somehow infectious. Simple exposure sometimes appears to be a sufficient condition for social transmission to occur."

*"When we are talking to someone who is depressed it may make us feel depressed, whereas if we talk to someone who is feeling self-confident and buoyant we are likely to feel good about ourselves. This phenomenon, known as emotional contagion, is identified here, and compelling evidence for its affect is offered from a variety of disciplines - social and developmental psychology, history, cross-cultural psychology, experimental psychology, and psychopathology."*

We've all known at least one person who really did seem able to "light up the room with their smile," or another who could "kill the mood" without saying a word. We've all found ourselves drawn to some people and not others, based on how we felt around them, in ways we weren't able to articulate.

## Happy People

Are happy people just oblivious to the realities of life? Studies show that happy people are actually able to think logically. And happier people are healthier.

*"The fact that there is always a positive side to life is the one thing that gives me a lot of happiness. This world is not perfect. There are problems. But things like happiness and unhappiness are relative. Realizing this gives you hope." -- The Dalai Lama*

*In a gentle way, you can shake the world. It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves honoured by the humiliation of their fellow beings. -- Mahatma Gandhi*

"People who are easily angered generally have what some psychologists call a low tolerance for frustration, meaning simply that they feel that they should not have to be subjected to frustration, inconvenience, or annoyance. They can't take things in stride, and they're particularly infuriated if the situation seems somehow unjust: for example, being corrected for a minor mistake."

"It's best to find out what it is that triggers your anger, and then to develop strategies to keep those triggers from tipping you over the edge."
