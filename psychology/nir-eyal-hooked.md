Hooked By Nir Eyal (Sample Chapter) 

A 2011 university study suggested people check their phones 34 times per 
day.iii However, industry insiders believe that number is closer to an astounding 
150 daily sessions.iv 
Face it, we’re hooked

It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit 
YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still 
tapping and scrolling an hour later. It’s the urge you likely feel throughout your 
day but hardly notice.

For many products, forming habits is an imperative for survival. As infinite 
distractions compete for our attention, companies are learning to master novel 
tactics to stay relevant in users’ minds. Today, amassing millions of users is no 
longer good enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a 
function of the strength of the habits they create. In order to win the loyalty of 
their users and create a product that’s regularly used, companies must learn not 
only what compels users to click, but also what makes them tick

Companies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom 
line. These companies attach their product to “internal triggers.” As a result, 
users show up without any external prompting. 


Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their 
services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.vii A habit is at work when 
users feel a tad bored and instantly open Twitter. They feel a pang of loneliness 
and before rational thought occurs, they are scrolling through their Facebook 
feeds. A question comes to mind and before searching their brains, they query 
Google. The first-to-mind solution wins. In chapter one, this book explores the competitive advantages of habit-forming products

How do products create habits? The answer: They manufacture them. While 
fans of the television show Mad Men are familiar with how the ad industry once 
created consumer desire during Madison Avenue’s golden era, those days are 
long gone. A multi-screen world of ad-wary consumers has rendered Don 
Draper’s big budget brainwashing useless to all but the biggest brands.

Notable companies were making billions of dollars selling virtual cows on 
digital farms while advertisers were spending huge sums of money to influence 
people to buy whatever they were peddling. I admit I didn’t get it at first and 
found myself standing at the water’s edge wondering, "How do they do it?"

In 2011, I 
began sharing what I learned and started working as a consultant to a host of 
Silicon Valley companies, from small startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. Each 
client provided an opportunity to test my theories, draw new insights, and refine 
my thinking. I began blogging about what I learned at NirAndFar.com and my 
essays were syndicated to other sites. Soon, readers began writing in with their 
own observations and examples.

These years of distilled research and real-world experience resulted in the creation of the Hook Model: a four-phase process companies use to forms 
habits. Through consecutive hook cycles, successful products reach their 
ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly, 
without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging. 

1. Trigger: A trigger is the actuator of behavior - the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: External and internal. Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an email, a website link, or the app icon on a phone. "Something happend so I did this thing." Ex: Barbara sees a photo in FB of a family member from a rural part of the state. Her behavior is associated with our human need for social connection.

2. Action: The behavior done in anticipation of a reward. Simply clicking the picture takes Barbara to Pinterest. This draws upon UX to reveal how products drive user actions. Companies have to leverage the ease of perforing an action and the psychological motivation to do it.

3. Variable Reward: Yung "hindi ako sigurado kung makukuha ko to or not" is an insane and extremely powerful tool companies use to hook users. The neurotransmitter dopamine surges when the brain is expecting a reward. The part of the brain associated with judgement and reason is suppressed while the parts associated with wanting and desire is activated. Ex: Slot machines, lotteries, Pinterest (looking for cool stuff to scroll). (Pinterest is like 80% repins.)

4. Investment: User puts something in: data, effort, social capital, or money. This involves inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, learning to use new features. These are __commitments__ which can be leveraged to make the trigger more exciting.

As companies combine their increased connectivity to consumers, with the ability to collect, mine, and process customer data at faster speeds, we are faced with a future where everything becomes potentially more habit-forming.

But why are zombies suddenly so fascinating? Perhaps technology’s 
unstoppable progress — ever more pervasive and persuasive — has grabbed us 
in a fearful malaise at the thought of being involuntarily controlled.

“Choice architecture,” as described 
by famed scholars Thaler, Sunstein, and Balz, offers techniques to influence 
people’s decisions and affect behavioral outcomes. Ultimately though, the 
practice should be, “used to help nudge people to make better choices (as 
judged by themselves).”xv Accordingly, this book teaches innovators how to 
build products to help people do the things they already want to do but, for lack 
of a solution, don’t do

Hooked seeks to unleash the tremendous new powers innovators and 
entrepreneurs have to influence the everyday lives of billions of people. I believe 
the trinity of access, data, and speed presents unprecedented opportunities to 
create positive habits. When harnessed correctly, technology can enhance lives 
through healthful behaviors that improve our relationships, make us smarter, 
and increase productivity

## Behavior by Design Udemy

This is for the frustrated creator, we were frustrated when cx don't do the actions we want.

OMG? Businesses are able to explode, such as Twitter, FB, IG. Vitamins or painkillers? A painkiller is about selling obvious needs, and a vitamin is an emotional need ("I'm not so sure if this works but it makes me feel better").

In order for a habit to become a habit, it has to be something that you hate when you don't do.

The OMG sells us a pleasure-seeking (okay, it looks cool), and they also sell us the painkiller to solve it. We can create addicitive things because of:

1. Greater access to anyone.
2. Greater speeds
3. More data gathered.

Your interests have to be your users' interests. They HAVE to be aligned. But honestly though, there are more distractions, harder to find users, and viral channels are dying.

Trade-off wise, habits > viral. Even if your product is not super viral, you can create a habitual product (Amazon, Evernote).

Friendster and Myspace didn't understand human behavior. FB did.

#### Automaticity

Automaticity is an instant response to stimuli. It's closely connected to the dopamine pathways. Habits and automaticity are about how we can act faster. This is used to learn, it saves energy of effort, it speeds up decisions, it keeps us safe, it allows us to multitasks, and we can have this small area of the brain that does repeat tasks.

How to engineer this? Long way: Repetition. "Cx is okay with bad UX, such as craigslist, because it's just already there". Short way: Desire. We have this thing called the desire engine.

	Trigger -> Action -> Variable Reward -> Commitment.

Higher habit potential: Fast cycles (we want a cx to complete all 4 steps with each visit), or frequent revolutions. We want to use these products multiple times per day.

Triggers: We have a lot. Fear, ice cream, social

- External: Alarms, advertising, calls-to-action, emails, stories. These are external stuff. 
- Internal: Emotions, routines, situations, places, people. These are triggered within the user's own brain. The desire engine wants to move from External (ads) to Internal.

The most powerful is emotion, and specifically, negative emotion. Dissatisfied, indecisive, lost, tense, fatigued, inferior, boredom, lonesome, fear, confusion, powerlessness, discouraged. The same with cigarettes, it is physically painful at some point.

__Action: When doing is easier than thinking.__ 

Fogg's B = m.a.t.

- Trigger = Super easy, no cognitive load, super lots of triggers to get you to act upon something. User experience: How do we make it very clear for cx to know where to act. How can we make the product easier. Sometimes, features just complicate shit.
- Motivation = role of marketing.
- Ability = product design.

__Variable Reward.__

Ex: Casino. But in tech, ex: Differing rewards for browsing the site and getting something. We have this innate need to bring order to chaos. Satisfaction is not beneficial. Curiosity is beneficial. Figuring out how things work. That's what we want.

The search for rewards for the Tribe, the Hunt, and the Self.

- Tribe: We constantly search for acceptance, sex, power.
- Hunt/resources: We want food, money, information. We're obsessively looking at Twitter or stats is because of this.
- Self: Master, consistency, competency, purpose. (Dan Pink)

Flashing lights, etc. are triggers. Sports: Tribe. Hunt for the win: If I have the team colors, I can affect the outcome. Email/SMS: It's ridiculously hard to not view an unread message. I want to clear that unread message because my inbox will be clean. I also want to know what the message is!

Twitter's scroller is a strong reward mechanism. Boring, boring, boring, cool! It's the same as in pinterest: searching and searching, but never finding.

We can vary: Type (tribe/hunt/self), frequency, or amplitude (reward or punishment).

__Commitment.__

We need a reward first before we ask for a commitment with either time, money, social capital or data. The commitments make the next action more likely.

Little commitments, big results. A small commitment keeps you in track already. Commitments are about consistency of self-image. We hate people who change their minds! Being inconsistent causes cognitive dissonance. In product design, doing simple behaviors that get the people to commit increases the commitment of a user.

__Farmville.__

- Trigger: FB Feed.
- Action: Play
- VR: Points
- C: Commitment. Build farm, invite others, pay $

Farmville triggers you when you're bored... you're lonesome... and your anxiety with loss aversion ("your farm will die"). And they sell the painkiller.

__Email.__

- Icon on phone.
- Open unreade message.
- Tribe/hunt/self.
- Write back. Every time you use email, you commit to the system because you want to respond back.

__How to Use a Desire Engine.__

- Think of what the INTERNAL TRIGGER will be. What pre-existing habit are you attending to?
- Confirm the EXTERNAL TRIGGER touches the user has had in the existing habit. Ensure user understand what it's for.
- Prompot the intended ACTION - Make sure it's very simple and defined. Ex: We want the user to scroll.
- Add VARIABLE REWARDS.
- Ask for the COMMITMENT.

We want to increase the speed through each engine, or increase the number of engines in user flow. But also keep on creating things.

To break: Create steps, add space, add discomfort.

## [Knowing Your Behavior Type](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhfpHIFbua0)

An Amateur behavior: He wanted to do running: Things such as "

What worked: Make it simple and easy. Focus on fun. Do the minimum enjoyable action (walking), and trigger and track. "When I write on that paper, I do this. Then I am able to track my thing."

To improve amateur behaviors: Lifetime goals, small/slow changes, reward motivated, OK with OK (I don't want to be an athlete, I just wanted to be okay.)

When he wanted to do blogging, he had a different behavior type so he can't use the thing he used in running.

Skillful behaviors: Baseline competency, hard work, big change, outcome driven. Ex: Engineering, musical instruments, writing a blog.

To improve: Deliberate practice, grit, hard work, and coaching.

Now the problem is, we mix the behavior change method with the behavior change type. There are things which you need hard work, and things you need mehthe small/slow changes.

Amateur: You need a low degree of self-control. Skilled: You need a high degree of self-control.

To stop the behavior of eating carbs, he discovered Habitual Behaviors (to stop eating food, stop checking email, stop shopping).

Habitual behaviors have: Constant temptations (we can't stop eating completely), Pain of desire. It's about dealing with the stress of the dopamine system in our brains.

To work with this, he managed the pain of desire, created space, being mindful, and surfing the urge.

Bringing awareness to urge, 10-minute rule: "I can eat anything I want, as long as I wait 10 minutes before I ate", reminder of purpose ("why am I DOING THIS SHIT???"), self-compassion (allowing myself to fail).

Types

- "I want to do", low self-control requried: __Amateur__.
- "I want to do", high self-control required: __Skillful__.
- "I don't want to do", low self-control required: __Habitual__.
- "I don't want to do", high self-contro requried: __Addictive__.

Addictive: Self-destructive, binary (you are either clean or sober), and they are very hard to resist. To stop addictive behaviors: Total abstinence and root cause analysis.

So you can figure out what the behavior type is, and use the behavior thing to deal.

Tracking works when it is in expert/skillful behavior, not much for habitual.

When you want a bunch of things to change in your life, it's like "I dont' want the things I feel after you do."

He was able to get things to work because he did not have stress at work, after having sold the company. Better sequentially, yeah.

## [Ways To Get People To Do Things They Don’t Want To Do](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/02/how-to-get-people-to-do-things-they-dont-want-to-do/)

Though the auditor’s job is unique, getting others to do uninteresting tasks (specifically those that are infrequent and involve work done outside normal responsibilities) is a common challenge.

What made my daughter’s visit to the doctor so painless helps illustrate three tactics anyone can use to get people to do things they don’t inherently want to do.

1. One Prick At A Time: Stage tasks into small, conquerable chunks. Most users just want to know what to do next, and flooding with info is bad. You need the forethought to approximately stage the work can reduce this fear.
2. Reduce the Pain with Progress: If ever, you want these things to be done not sporadically. The nurse asked his daughter to count to five as she administered each shot, giving my daughter an idea of how long the pain would last and creating a sense of control. "Are we there yet" progres bars.
3. Get Out The Treasure Chest. Numerous studies have shown that extrinsic rewards — incentives that are separate from the activity itself — often backfire. Reinforcing behavior this way tends to extinguish the pleasure of doing something for its own sake. But while motivating through meaning is preferred, there are circumstances when prizes are in fact appropriate. When it comes to tasks people don’t want to do, specifically infrequent and uninteresting assignments, utilizing extrinsic rewards is safe because there is no existing behavior to de-motivate or extinguish.

## [Getting Your Product Into the Habit Zone](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/02/getting-your-product-into-the-habit-zone/)

Creating user habits leverages two critical factors that should be considered by every company attempting to build high-engagement products.

Action Without Cognition: Habits are one of the ways the brain learns complex behaviors. In order to allow us to focus our attention on obtaining new insights, neuroscientists believe habitual behaviors are moved to the basal ganglia, an area of the brain associated with actions requiring little or no cognition. Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating about the decision being made.

Like nail biting, many of the decisions we make in our daily lives are made simply because that’s the way we’ve found satisfaction in the past. The brain automatically deduces that if the decision was a good one yesterday, then it’s a safe bet again today.

The Mind Monopoly: In a recent study at the University College London, researchers followed participants as they attempted to form a habit of flossing their teeth. As one of its findings, the study concluded that the more frequently the new behavior occurred, the stronger the habit. Like flossing, frequent engagement with a web site or app increases the likelihood of forming new habits.

If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Though many aspects or Bing are identical to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be convert to learn something new. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually slows the user down and makes Bing feel inferior.

Habits as Strategy: For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain. 

Amazon seeks to become the solution to a frequently occurring pain point: the customer’s needs to find the item they’re looking for at the best possible price. By addressing the shopper’s price concerns, Amazon earns loyalty even if it doesn’t make the sale.

The tactic is backed by a 2003 study by Trifts and Hubl, which demonstrated that consumer’s preference for an online retailer increases when they are offered competitive price information. The technique has also been used by Progressive to drive over $15 billion of annual insurance sales, up from just $3.4 billion before the tactic was implemented.

Companies can begin to determine their product’s potential for forming a habitual behavior by plotting two factors: frequency (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility (how rewarding the behavior is in the eyes of the user). “The Habit Zone,” as I call it, is where an action occurs with enough frequency and perceived utility for it to become the default behavior.

## [Make Your Users Do the Work](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/22/make-your-users-do-the-work/)

the law that design should always decrease the amount of effort users expend doesn’t always hold true. In fact, putting users to work is critical in creating products people love.

expending effort on a task seems to commit us to it. For example, when buying a lottery ticket, players are able to either choose their own numbers or play a set of digits generated randomly. Certainly, choosing either option has no effect on the odds of winning. Traditional thinking would predict that the less effortful path would be the one users prefer.

However, the opposite is true. Despite the considerable effort required to pick the lottery numbers, a process reminiscent of filling out multiple choice questions on the S.A.T., players who choose their own numbers play more.

According to a classic study by Ellen Langler, even when players are explicitly told their chances of winning, they choose to trade worse odds for the ability to play the numbers they spent the time and effort picking.

Examples of how escalations of commitment makes our brain do funny things abound. Its power makes some people play video games until they keel over and die. It’s used to influence people to give more to charity. It has even been used to coerce prisoners of war to switch allegiances. Commitment is powerful stuff and it plays an important role in the things we do, the products we buy, and our perception of who we are.

Unlike actions in the standard feedback loop, investments are about the anticipation of rewards, not immediate gratification. The investment is a bit of work, which makes the user more likely to use the product in the future. In Twitter, for example, the investment comes in the form of a follow. After a few flicks through the stream have primed the user with titillating tweets, the user will find someone new and interesting to invest in. While there is no immediate reward for following someone, doing so makes the service more valuable and more likely to be used next time.

Stored Value: Every time users input data, they create stored value. Evernote, Salesforce, and Pandora provide examples of products which do not necessarily create burning desires, but create habits by getting users to do bits of work.

Other stored value technologies, like games, create rabid users by getting them to invest every time they play. Racking up higher scores, advancing to the next level, or earning and tending to virtual goods like a cow on a farm or the clothes on an avatar, are all examples of the power of commitment.

Network Value: Products that increase in value as a greater number of people use them have a network effect. Companies which display this characteristic give investors joyful palpitations because of their ability to become industry standards and crowd-out rivals.

## [Spotting The Next Facebook: Why Emotions Are Big Business](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/facebook-why-emotions-are-big-business/)

Like many of the astoundingly successful web companies of the last decade, it was hard to appreciate the value of Facebook at first glance. But one person who “got Facebook” early on was Noah Kagan, who in October of 2005 joined the company as one of its first product managers.

>“The Facebook success story is most interesting to me because of how daily offline social behavior drove usage of the site. There are plenty of activities in our daily life that could benefit from a complementary online product … Facebook demonstrates you have a great Internet service if offline behaviors can drive nearly daily usage online.”

acebook succeeded because it built new online habits around frequent offline behaviors. Originally, Facebook was designed to replace the physical face books undergraduates received their first week of school. 

TheFacebook.com, as it was originally known, offered users a digital way to feel connected to others throughout the day and from anywhere they could access the web. The power of this universal human need for social acceptance and connection helps explain how the company grew well beyond college campuses and now touches one in eight people on the planet.
