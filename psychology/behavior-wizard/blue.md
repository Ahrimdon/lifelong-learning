## PurpleDot Behaviors.

Many people seek Purple Path behaviors. They are already doing something good, like exercising, and they are ready to take it to the next level. This increased intensity or duration of a familiar behavior (like exercise) is what Purple Path is all about.

To achieve a Purple Path Behavior, it is necessary to alter at least one element from the Fogg Behavior Model:

Increase the number of triggers leading to the desirable behavior.
Enhance ability to perform the behavior (make it easier to do)
Amplify motivation for doing the behavior with intrinsic and extrinsic motivators.

## PurpleDot Behaviors: You want to increase the intensity or duration of a behavior not forever but just one time.

Ex: Health: Exercise for 30 minutes longer for today only.

Purple Dot Behaviors can stretch people. And by pushing limits people can get insight and confidence into increased performance in exercise, savings, diet, or other areas. Purple Dot can help people eventually increase the target behavior for a longer period of time.

Holidays encourage Purple Dot behaviors. X-mas: People are more charitable. Valentine's: People are more expressive of love. Thanksgiving, we emphasize our gratitude. These holidays all help us learn to perform the extreme behaviors. That's a good thing, it carries over to the other days of the year.

Purple Dot can be done for charity: "Race for a Cure", "AIDS Walk", "Walkathons/Telethons". __To achieve a Purple Dot, increase one of ability, motivation, or trigger.__

## PurpleSpan Behaviors: You want to increase the intensity or duration of a behavior not forever but for a period of time.

Ex: Environment: Increase days spent walking to work this month.

This is typical in campaigns, bootcamps, contests, retreats, "crash" courses, interventions. Span means more than one day. Span means increasing, let's say for 14 days.

To achieve a PS behavior, it is necc to alter one of the MAT.
