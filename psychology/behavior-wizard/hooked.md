Hooked By Nir Eyal (Sample Chapter) 

A 2011 university study suggested people check their phones 34 times per 
day.iii However, industry insiders believe that number is closer to an astounding 
150 daily sessions.iv 
Face it, we’re hooked

It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit 
YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still 
tapping and scrolling an hour later. It’s the urge you likely feel throughout your 
day but hardly notice.

For many products, forming habits is an imperative for survival. As infinite 
distractions compete for our attention, companies are learning to master novel 
tactics to stay relevant in users’ minds. Today, amassing millions of users is no 
longer good enough. Companies increasingly find that their economic value is a 
function of the strength of the habits they create. In order to win the loyalty of 
their users and create a product that’s regularly used, companies must learn not 
only what compels users to click, but also what makes them tick

Companies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom 
line. These companies attach their product to “internal triggers.” As a result, 
users show up without any external prompting. 


Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their 
services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.vii A habit is at work when 
users feel a tad bored and instantly open Twitter. They feel a pang of loneliness 
and before rational thought occurs, they are scrolling through their Facebook 
feeds. A question comes to mind and before searching their brains, they query 
Google. The first-to-mind solution wins. In chapter one, this book explores the competitive advantages of habit-forming products

How do products create habits? The answer: They manufacture them. While 
fans of the television show Mad Men are familiar with how the ad industry once 
created consumer desire during Madison Avenue’s golden era, those days are 
long gone. A multi-screen world of ad-wary consumers has rendered Don 
Draper’s big budget brainwashing useless to all but the biggest brands.

Notable companies were making billions of dollars selling virtual cows on 
digital farms while advertisers were spending huge sums of money to influence 
people to buy whatever they were peddling. I admit I didn’t get it at first and 
found myself standing at the water’s edge wondering, "How do they do it?"

In 2011, I 
began sharing what I learned and started working as a consultant to a host of 
Silicon Valley companies, from small startups to Fortune 500 enterprises. Each 
client provided an opportunity to test my theories, draw new insights, and refine 
my thinking. I began blogging about what I learned at NirAndFar.com and my 
essays were syndicated to other sites. Soon, readers began writing in with their 
own observations and examples.

These years of distilled research and real-world experience resulted in the creation of the Hook Model: a four-phase process companies use to forms 
habits. Through consecutive hook cycles, successful products reach their 
ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly, 
without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging. 

1. Trigger: A trigger is the actuator of behavior - the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: External and internal. Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an email, a website link, or the app icon on a phone. "Something happend so I did this thing." Ex: Barbara sees a photo in FB of a family member from a rural part of the state. Her behavior is associated with our human need for social connection.

2. Action: The behavior done in anticipation of a reward. Simply clicking the picture takes Barbara to Pinterest. This draws upon UX to reveal how products drive user actions. Companies have to leverage the ease of perforing an action and the psychological motivation to do it.

3. Variable Reward: Yung "hindi ako sigurado kung makukuha ko to or not" is an insane and extremely powerful tool companies use to hook users. The neurotransmitter dopamine surges when the brain is expecting a reward. The part of the brain associated with judgement and reason is suppressed while the parts associated with wanting and desire is activated. Ex: Slot machines, lotteries, Pinterest (looking for cool stuff to scroll). (Pinterest is like 80% repins.)

4. Investment: User puts something in: data, effort, social capital, or money. This involves inviting friends, stating preferences, building virtual assets, learning to use new features. These are __commitments__ which can be leveraged to make the trigger more exciting.

As companies combine their increased connectivity to consumers, with the ability to collect, mine, and process customer data at faster speeds, we are faced with a future where everything becomes potentially more habit-forming.

But why are zombies suddenly so fascinating? Perhaps technology’s 
unstoppable progress — ever more pervasive and persuasive — has grabbed us 
in a fearful malaise at the thought of being involuntarily controlled.

“Choice architecture,” as described 
by famed scholars Thaler, Sunstein, and Balz, offers techniques to influence 
people’s decisions and affect behavioral outcomes. Ultimately though, the 
practice should be, “used to help nudge people to make better choices (as 
judged by themselves).”xv Accordingly, this book teaches innovators how to 
build products to help people do the things they already want to do but, for lack 
of a solution, don’t do

Hooked seeks to unleash the tremendous new powers innovators and 
entrepreneurs have to influence the everyday lives of billions of people. I believe 
the trinity of access, data, and speed presents unprecedented opportunities to 
create positive habits. When harnessed correctly, technology can enhance lives 
through healthful behaviors that improve our relationships, make us smarter, 
and increase productivity

## Behavior by Design Udemy

This is for the frustrated creator, we were frustrated when cx don't do the actions we want.

OMG? Businesses are able to explode, such as Twitter, FB, IG. Vitamins or painkillers? A painkiller is about selling obvious needs, and a vitamin is an emotional need ("I'm not so sure if this works but it makes me feel better").

In order for a habit to become a habit, it has to be something that you hate when you don't do.

The OMG sells us a pleasure-seeking (okay, it looks cool), and they also sell us the painkiller to solve it. We can create addicitive things because of:

1. Greater access to anyone.
2. Greater speeds
3. More data gathered.

Your interests have to be your users' interests. They HAVE to be aligned. But honestly though, there are more distractions, harder to find users, and viral channels are dying.

Trade-off wise, habits > viral. Even if your product is not super viral, you can create a habitual product (Amazon, Evernote).

Friendster and Myspace didn't understand human behavior. FB did.

#### Automaticity

Automaticity is an instant response to stimuli. It's closely connected to the dopamine pathways. Habits and automaticity are about how we can act faster. This is used to learn, it saves energy of effort, it speeds up decisions, it keeps us safe, it allows us to multitasks, and we can have this small area of the brain that does repeat tasks.

How to engineer this? Long way: Repetition. "Cx is okay with bad UX, such as craigslist, because it's just already there". Short way: Desire. We have this thing called the desire engine.

	Trigger -> Action -> Variable Reward -> Commitment.

Higher habit potential: Fast cycles (we want a cx to complete all 4 steps with each visit), or frequent revolutions. We want to use these products multiple times per day.

Triggers: We have a lot. Fear, ice cream, social

- External: Alarms, advertising, calls-to-action, emails, stories. These are external stuff. 
- Internal: Emotions, routines, situations, places, people. These are triggered within the user's own brain. The desire engine wants to move from External (ads) to Internal.

The most powerful is emotion, and specifically, negative emotion. Dissatisfied, indecisive, lost, tense, fatigued, inferior, boredom, lonesome, fear, confusion, powerlessness, discouraged. The same with cigarettes, it is physically painful at some point.

__Action: When doing is easier than thinking.__
