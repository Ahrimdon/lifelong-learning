The unfortunate superpower ofthe negative is that it has a stronger impact than the positive. In fact, negative impact of setbacks in your work is three times as powerful in affecting motivation than positive progress. It's just easier to remember the bad stuff that happened to you during the day than the good.

We are wired to pay more attention to negative experiences (self-protective characteristics). However, we have the ability to break out of that negative feedback loop and we can actually rewire our brains to think positively. Understanding how the brain can refashion its own connections is the key to unlocking the durable power of positive thinking.

After playing Tetris, your mind still continues to play the game, even when you're physically not (you think about rearranging shelves and carts in the parking lot). The things you do during the day are things that you dream about at night.

A recent study found that playing Tetris (1.5 hours/week over 3 months) grew brain's cerebral cortex. The brain consumed less energy as mastery of the game rose. Every time you reactivate a circuit, synaptic efficiency increases, and connections become more durable and easier to reactivate. *Whenever you do specific tasks over and over again, they take up less of your brain power over time.*

## Positive Tetris Effect

"We can retrain the brain to scan for the good things in life--to help us see more possibility to feel more energy, and to succeed at higher levels." *People who did a "three good things" exercise for a week felt happier and less depressed after one month.* It's like learning a foreign language. It will be the most difficult and unnatural-feeling at the beginning.

- *Scan for the 3 daily positives.* At the end of each day, make a list of three specific good things that happened that day and reflect on what caused them to happen. Celebrating small wins also has a proven effect of powering motivation and igniting join. As you record your good things daily, the better you will get and feel.
- *Give one shout-out to someone (daily).* Take the positive things you're getting better at recognizing and let people know you've noticed. Take a minute to say thanks or recognize someone for their efforts, from friends and family to people at work.
- *Do something nice.* Acts of kindness boost happiness levels. Do something nice that is small and concrete like buying someone a coffee!
- *Make your mind.* Mindfulness is paying attention to the present moment with judgment. Opening our awareness beyond the narrowness of negativity can help bring back more balance and positivity into the picture.

The regular practice of mindfulness meditation has also been shown to affect the brain's plasticity increasing gray matter in the hippocampus.
