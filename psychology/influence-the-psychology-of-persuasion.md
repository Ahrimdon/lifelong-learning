## Influence â€“ The Psychology of Persuasion
[Reference](https://www.2uo.de/influence/)

- **Reciprocation:** making people want to do a favor to others who have already done a favor to them.,
- **Consistency:** making people lock onto one behavior and not abandoning it, even if this behavior turns out to be disadvantageous.
- **Social proof:**, having people orient themselves to the behavior of others.
- **Authority:** Where people accept orders by supposed experts or figures of authority.
- **Liking:** Making people tend to comply with others who they like.
- **Scarcity:** Making people crave that which they cannot easily have.

- Contrast effect: differences seem exaggerated when the different things are presented one after the other. Sell an expensive item first (a suit) and cheaper accessories afterwards.

- Reciprocation: Reciprocal concessions: you request something, have this request rejected, and then request something smaller.
  - Being indebted feels burdensome. We want to get rid of this obligation. This makes sense considering that this fosters cooperation between people.
  - Even uninvited gifts (like flowers) and those things that seem to be imposed on us after courteously declining.
  - Even if the requested favor-in-return is disproportionate.
- Commitment and Consistency
  - People are more likely to comply with a larger request after they have already complied with a trivial request.
  - When people own what they have written themselves, they identify with it and it's hard to change their stance later. This can be handy in more benign circumstances: a salesman that lets the buyer fill out the sales agreement will find that there will be fewer cancellations. People feel more bound by a contract when they have physically written part of it.
  - Is there a way to resist this psychological need for consistency? Of course, it is easier when you're aware of the effect. But the effect is only lessened and must actively be overcome by the rational mind, there's no way to really switch it off.
- Liking
  - Physical attractiveness
  - Similarity: same hobbies, same jobs.
  - It's very hard to avoid this liking effect, we can only recognize it and then force ourselves to separate the issue from the person.
- Scarcity
  - We feel a lot of pressure when we're made to believe that an opportunity would be lost a short time later. Therefore all those sales with time limits and offers only valid today. We feel we might miss out on some great deal.
  - But it gets really devastating when (perceived) scarcity meets rivalry. Only one car on sale, but there are two other people interested in it, and willing to buy immediately. Salesmen like to have several prospective buyers show up at the same time. So they schedule them at the same time.

- It's not just the flesh that is weak. The mind is just as weak, or at least malleable. We cannot switch off our evolutionary baggage and programming, but we can be aware of it and keep it at bay. In Daniel Kahnemann's parlance: we can activate System 2 to override System 1.
