## Procrastination

- **Idealistic.** "I want this task to..." - you want the situation to be perfectly conducive to success.
  - Readiness - "I will do it when I am ready".
- **Avoidant.** Tends to be based on emotions, especially negative emotion because your brain is trying to protect you from these emotions. **The root for your procrastination are your emotions.**
- **Operational.** "Unclear tasks" i.e. "finding a job" is so abstract.

### Finding a Solution

- **Idealistic.** Trying is in the middle of doing and failing, which prevents you from acting and taking the next step.
- **Avoidant.** What is the emotion that you are feeling or are trying to avoid feeling? If you had a friend who felt X emotion, what would I say to them?
- **Operational.** Chunk the task into its smallest constituent ones.

### How Gaming Affects Procrastination

- The problem is that a lot of the challenges that gamers suffer from are not close-ended problems — they are open-ended problems. These are problems that do not have a particular sandbox.
- An example of an open-ended problem is gaining financial independence. That seems so vague — what does financial independence even mean? It may involve certain pieces such as finding a job, moving out of your parent’s place, etc. But gamers seem to have trouble with problems that do not seem to have a particular set of tools or a particular goal. They struggle with abstract things.
- Gamers will say things like they are lazy or unmotivated, but what they do not realize is that open-ended problem solving is a skill that can be learned and taught. Since gamers spend so much time playing video games, they end up losing opportunities to learn this kind of problem-solving.
- **There is a part of the brain called the frontal lobe which is responsible for planning and executing actions. Gamers tend to have under-developed frontal lobes because games do the planning for them. In a game, you do not have to figure out which level to do first — the game chunks up the levels for you.**
- It is about developing a particular cognitive skill of taking an open-ended abstract problem and being able to chunk it up.
  - If you can sit down and consciously take a problem that you have and operationalize it i.e break it down into its parts and figure out what you need to do it each step of the way, then you will suddenly start to move forward in life.
- If you want to start moving forward in life, teach your brain how to take abstract problems and turn them into concrete ones.
  - The neat thing about gamers is that if they are given a concrete problem and a concrete set of tools, they will figure it out on your own.
- **If you find that you have this kind of thought process, then chances are that it is part of the reason why you are not able to move forward in life. You don't even give yourself a chance to try.**

### Solution to Outcome-Oriented Thinking

- Don't focus on the outcome of your actions. Try to focus on what you’re doing, not on what you’re getting. The more that gamers get hung up on outcomes, the more problems they run into. However, focusing on the action and ignoring the result moves you closer to the result.
- Change from an abstract goal into a more concrete one — so getting into shape can mean losing ten pounds. But even for that, do not focus on the goal, focus on the action. So instead of telling yourself to get into shape or lose ten pounds, tell yourself that you need to go to the gym three times a week.

### How Intelligence Affects Procrastination

- If a child thinks that they are smart, then they would want to do things that other people are gonna perceive as being smart. But if there are things that they are not very good at, and they feel stupid when they try it, then they are very unlikely to attempt it.
  - Over time, the smart kid only does things that make them appear smart, which means things that are generally easier. They stay away from things that are hard for them.
  - This works out fine until they reach third grade, fourth grade, or fifth grade because as a smart kid you do not have to spend a whole lot of time studying.
- A kid who is told that they are smart avoids challenging things and as they get older, that avoidance becomes baked in. It becomes a part of who they are and how they move around in the world.
- **The world values, as well as rewards, is experience and competence. A lot of people are really smart, but they don't amount to much.**
- When you try things and you accept that you are inexperienced, then failure becomes more and more acceptable. The problem that you have likely is that you cannot tolerate the idea of failing.

## Depression

**Is Depression a Mental Illness?**

- Clinical depression - even if you have a good job, family, relationship, and you wake up every day and you feel sad and empty, that is more consistent with CD. "This person should be happy."
  - Serotonin can be low. If we correct that serotonin imbalance, then they start to live the normal life that they are supposed to.
- Congruent depression: If you are stuck in life, then it makes sense for you to be depressed. However, you can also get clinical depression from that incident.
  - If the bad circumstance is fixed, the clinical depression will have episodes of depression that are independent of their circumstances (i.e. it becomes episodic).
  - **People who have congruent D often have a life that lacks purpose, they lack motivation, feel lonely and paralysed, they feel stuck. They feel like they are living their life on autopilot.**

### Origin of Depression

- **Default mode network** - gives people the capacity for self-awareness or self-reflection.
  - Deer do not have this - they can search for shit in the same place because they forgot about it.
  - **Those who are depressed tend to have an overactive DMN.** Any tiny external and unrelated thing can turn into personal fault or guilt. As a result, depressed people can say things like "I think my family is better off without me" because the overactive DMN observes an external unrelated situation and creates false narratives and conclusions about how they are the cause for it.
- If you can detach yourself from self-reflection, then your depression would actually lessen. This is clinically observed in patients that received ketamine as a treatment for depression - shut off the DMN, pause the self-reflection.

- The brain is designed for a simpler survival lifestyle. The current problems that society faces are more complex in mental need. In the past, survival was the only challenge that society faced, and family profession influenced the direction of your future career path.
- But now that most of our survival needs are met, the only thing people are missing is purpose. But there is little direction or no clear answer as to how you find purpose. Like the rich kings, despite having your needs met, you are simply left unhappy, and can turn to religion or spirituality.

### Dealing with Depression, Diet

- Mental health professionals. Meditation, yoga, proper diet, exercise.
- When the circadian rhythm is off, the body is in a pro-inflammatory state, and the body feels lazy and people do not want to do anything.
- Eat fruits and vegetables, and avoid processed foods.
- Check: Anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin D and B12.
- Depression is not a binary state and is a spectrum of feelings. Like a sinking boat, you can plug up the holes to stop water from coming in, but the boat can still be sinking because there is still water in the boat. It is just sinking at a slower rate because there is no water coming in that is dragging the boat down. So keep bailing water out of your ship, keep taking care of yourself, and keep seeking help because your depression became a waiting game.

### Dealing with Self-Doubt

- The solution to the fear of failure is exposure therapy and managing your fear.
- Sometimes, people face self-doubt because they have set up unrealistic overconfidence and anything can cause that overconfidence to topple over and shatter. Basically, they have high peaks and very deep slumps.
