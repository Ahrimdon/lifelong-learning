## Depression

**Is Depression a Mental Illness?**

- Clinical depression - even if you have a good job, family, relationship, and you wake up every day and you feel sad and empty, that is more consistent with CD. "This person should be happy."
  - Serotonin can be low. If we correct that serotonin imbalance, then they start to live the normal life that they are supposed to.
- Congruent depression: If you are stuck in life, then it makes sense for you to be depressed. However, you can also get clinical depression from that incident.
  - If the bad circumstance is fixed, the clinical depression will have episodes of depression that are independent of their circumstances (i.e. it becomes episodic).
  - **People who have congruent D often have a life that lacks purpose, they lack motivation, feel lonely and paralysed, they feel stuck. They feel like they are living their life on autopilot.**

### Origin of Depression

- **Default mode network** - gives people the capacity for self-awareness or self-reflection.
  - Deer do not have this - they can search for shit in the same place because they forgot about it.
  - **Those who are depressed tend to have an overactive DMN.** Any tiny external and unrelated thing can turn into personal fault or guilt. As a result, depressed people can say things like "I think my family is better off without me" because the overactive DMN observes an external unrelated situation and creates false narratives and conclusions about how they are the cause for it.
- If you can detach yourself from self-reflection, then your depression would actually lessen. This is clinically observed in patients that received ketamine as a treatment for depression - shut off the DMN, pause the self-reflection.

- The brain is designed for a simpler survival lifestyle. The current problems that society faces are more complex in mental need. In the past, survival was the only challenge that society faced, and family profession influenced the direction of your future career path.
- But now that most of our survival needs are met, the only thing people are missing is purpose. But there is little direction or no clear answer as to how you find purpose. Like the rich kings, despite having your needs met, you are simply left unhappy, and can turn to religion or spirituality.

### Dealing with Depression, Diet

- Mental health professionals. Meditation, yoga, proper diet, exercise.
- When the circadian rhythm is off, the body is in a pro-inflammatory state, and the body feels lazy and people do not want to do anything.
- Eat fruits and vegetables, and avoid processed foods.
- Check: Anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin D and B12.
- Depression is not a binary state and is a spectrum of feelings. Like a sinking boat, you can plug up the holes to stop water from coming in, but the boat can still be sinking because there is still water in the boat. It is just sinking at a slower rate because there is no water coming in that is dragging the boat down. So keep bailing water out of your ship, keep taking care of yourself, and keep seeking help because your depression became a waiting game.

### Dealing with Self-Doubt

- The solution to the fear of failure is exposure therapy and managing your fear.
- Sometimes, people face self-doubt because they have set up unrealistic overconfidence and anything can cause that overconfidence to topple over and shatter. Basically, they have high peaks and very deep slumps.
