Negotiation: "Whatever you want to pay me" is NOT the right question.

Was I prepared? Did I do what I think I could? The one word you want to avoid is the word "regret". So be prepared and do everything you can. It's crucial to negotiate your salary whenever you have the chance.

The new reality: Lifetime employment is no longer there. We live in a "gig economy". Millenials may change jobs 7 times in the 20s. We have side projects, etc.

1. When interviewing, put yourself on equal footing. You should also be interviewing them.
2. Don't get emotional. This is a business transaction. Prove your worth.
3. Don't use self-defeating language. You do not want to shoot yourself in the foot. Don't say "I don't know if your busy, I don't know if there's room in the budget, I don't know if I have enough". You're putting words in their mouth.
4. Defeat them with data. No one can argue information, anyway.

The HR Perspective: Recruiting new people is expensive. Employers *always* leave a range and wiggle room. They expect you to counter-offer. It's sometimes reasonable for HR to just grant the increase because they have to go through resumes again.

You have to spend a ton of time for the negotiation, because it's a test! The right answer could be worth thousands of dollars.

## Job Search Mindset Tips

- Don't get too low. Job searching can be awful, expect starts and stops.
- Don't get too high. Keep small wins in check.
- Lean on your network: Business network. 70-80% of jobs are found through the business network. Some people actually take a coffee and lunch fund to network with people. Find yourself with job seeker groups.
- It takes longer than you think. It's a long process to get this shit done. The follow-up question: "That sounds great, if I don't hear back from you by Friday afternoon, would it be ok if I followed up with you?" At least you won't be anxious because they've already gave you permission to do so.

## Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued

- If you were to be paid $100K if you did five minutes of poetry recital while standing on one foot, would you do it? *Of course you would. You would take a poetry class to make sure you got it right, or go to the gym to verify that you could do it.*
- Salary negotiation--same as this. It's an x minutes discussion.
- The mindset: people think haggling is done in a flea market, not in an office.
- Salary negotiations are more important than house negotiations. Rich, successful people negotiate. This is how they get, and stay, rich.
- Get into the habit of seeing employees as employers see them: in terms of fully-loaded costs. To hire someone, you need to pay for their salary, and you have to have taxes, benefits, retirement contributions.
- Bob the HR person: if he gets expensive employees, this is great for him, since he gets a high-powered peon which means he is a high-powered manager, which will help Bob get more budget next quarter.
- *You don't owe Bob for giving you this job opportunity. If a deal makes economic sense, it will happen.* Bob is also most probably far far less invested in this negotiation than you are.
- Your job search will be much better if you:
  - Establish a reputation in your field as someone who delivers measurable results vis-a-vis improving revenue or reducing costs.
  - Have a hiring manager talk with you specifically about an opening they want you to fill.
  - Talk informally and come to the conclusion that this would be a great thing if both sides come to a mutually fulfilling offer.
  - Let them take a stab at what that mutually fulfilling offer would look like.
  - Suggest ways that they can improve it so you can do well to improve their revenue and reduce their costs.
  - Give the guy hiring you a resume to send to HR, for their records.
- *Start talking to people who actually work for those companies. No company has a hiring process which is accurately explained by blog posts about the company.*
- Major popular tech employer offered desirable employee $X as a salary because "it was the max the HR department allows for that position."  He got hired that week at $2X.  All parties — hiring organization, HR, and employee — think they pulled one over on the other participants.
- "We can't hire engineers fast enough through our standard processes so, meh, I guess we'll circumvent them by just tossing $1 million per employee at whomever they currently work for.  Who cares, it isn't my million."
- *Only negotiate salary after you have agreement in principle from someone with hiring authority that, if a mutually acceptable compensation can be agreed upon, you will be hired.*
- You'll quickly reach the conclusion that the company has spent thousands of dollars just talking to you, and that doesn't even count the thousands they spent deciding to talk to you instead of whoever isn't in the room right now.  Walking away from the negotiation means that they lose all that investment.  (Yeah, sunk cost fallacy and all, but since people predictably act in this fashion you should, well, predict that they will act in this fashion.)  They really want to reach an agreement with you.
- *If you negotiate your salary, it almost always never gets worse.* You also want to start from a "Yes-If", not a "No-But". "No-But" means they are leaning to not hiring you, and you will compromise on negotiation to get them to hire you.
- *This means that any discussion of compensation prior to hearing Yes-If is premature.  If you’re still at the job interview and you’re talking price you are doing something wrong.*

### The First Rule Is What Everyone Tells You It Is: Never Give A Number First

- They already deal with every employee that they've ever had who was not a doormat at negotiations, which includes essentially all of the employees they really value.
- Ramit Sethi (more on him later) introduced me to a concept that he calls Competence Triggers: basically, *if you have to judge someone’s skill based on a series of brief interactions, you’re going to pattern match their behavior against other people who you like.*
- When people with hiring authority think of winners, they think of people like them who live and breathe this business thing. They negotiate things as a matter of course: that is a major portion of the value they bring to the company.
- "I really need a number to move the process forward." Say: "I'm more concerned to see if we are a mutual fit. If we're a great fit, then I can be flexible on the numbers with you and you can be flexible on the numbers with me. If we're not a great fit, then the numbers will be irrelevant, because your company only hires A players and I only work at roles I would be an A player at."
- "This form needs a number." -> Say: "Put in a random amount."
- "We want to figure out whether you're an appropriate candidate for the position." -> "It's so important to me that this is a good mutual fit for us--let's talk about why I'm a great fit for this position: I know you're concerned about X, I can do X and I have great ideas for what I'd do about that if I was working at your company."
- I appreciate that this is a little more money than you might have been thinking about, but this is an opportunity to get this position filled without delaying your business by another six months. What is the value of that six months of execution to you?

### Research

- What do they value?
- Who do they value within the company?  (Roles?  Titles?  Groups?)
- What does the career path look like for successful people within the company?
- Roughly speaking, how generous are they with regard to axes that you care about?
- Do they have any compensation levers which are anomalously easy to operate?  (For example, if you asked around, you might hear a few people say that a particular firm pushes back modestly on out-of-band increases in salary but they’ll give in-the-money option grants like candy.)
- Corporate culture?
- "What are the projects this company thinks are really key to its future and how would a motivated person go about getting on them?" are both a) totally fair game and b) will win you brownie points just for asking.  Similarly, a lot of employees will, out of company loyalty, attempt to sell you on taking the job with the company by trading you very useful information.)
- The more you know, the more options you have when doing negotiation, because you’ll have more things and more motivational things which you can offer in exchange for things you want.
- You are an expert in your own skill set, life story, and (ideally) value you can create for the company. However, the person you are talking to is not. If they ever resist about something which you want, consider reaching into the treasure chest that they are buying mostly blind and revealing one of the many glittering jewels inside. They are going to get them all anyhow if they buy the chest, but each one you bring out decreases the perceived risk of buying it and therefor increases its perceived value.
- Multi-dimensional preference set: vacation days. Say "X is interesting". This means it's not wonderful. You can also say "I will run that number with my family".
