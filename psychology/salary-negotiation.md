Negotiation: "Whatever you want to pay me" is NOT the right question.

Was I prepared? Did I do what I think I could? The one word you want to avoid is the word "regret". So be prepared and do everything you can. It's crucial to negotiate your salary whenever you have the chance.

The new reality: Lifetime employment is no longer there. We live in a "gig economy". Millenials may change jobs 7 times in the 20s. We have side projects, etc.

1. When interviewing, put yourself on equal footing. You should also be interviewing them.
2. Don't get emotional. This is a business transaction. Prove your worth.
3. Don't use self-defeating language. You do not want to shoot yourself in the foot. Don't say "I don't know if your busy, I don't know if there's room in the budget, I don't know if I have enough". You're putting words in their mouth.
4. Defeat them with data. No one can argue information, anyway.

The HR Perspective: Recruiting new people is expensive. Employers _always_ leave a range and wiggle room. They expect you to counter-offer. It's sometimes reasonable for HR to just grant the increase because they have to go through resume`s again.

You have to spend a ton of time for the negotiation, because it's a test! The right answer could be worth thousands of dollars.

## Job Search Mindset Tips

- Don't get too low. Job searching can be awful, expect starts and stops.
- Don't get too high. Keep small wins in check.
- Lean on your network: Business network. 70-80% of jobs are found through the business network. Some people actually take a coffee and lunch fund to network with people. Find yourself with job seeker groups.
- It takes longer than you think. It's a long process to get this shit done. The follow-up question: "That sounds great, if I don't hear back from you by Friday afternoon, would it be ok if I followed up with you?" At least you won't be anxious because they've already gave you permission to do so.
