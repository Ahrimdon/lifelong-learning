## Habit-Forming Technology Patterns

Products can profoundly change our behaviors. The companies that have changed our day to day habits seemed to start as toys and they are massively underestimated. What I've done last year is to figure out those products.

So you need to know if your product is a vitamin or painkiller. Painkillers are needed, vitamins are "nice to have". A habit is when not doing something causes you a bit of pain. What we think of habit-forming technologies start as pleasure seeking behaviors and they become pain alleviating behaviors. 

When I ask I head across the board, anxiety. Or what I call the itch. It's a psychological response to a non-existent stimulus, there is no message.

Images of chocolate bring both pleasure and stress to "cravers", but they ascribed that feeling not to the chocolate, but to themselves. The brain associates behaviors that provide a solution to whatever problem it encounters.

Uses come to seek pleasure, but the product soon becomes an important product in their lives. And these determine their technology habits: we seek a solution to their discomfort found in our product's use.

We know that STRESS is a precondition for addiction. When scientists removed the stress gland from mice, the mice don't want to drink alcohol. When they increased, the mice wanted to drink more. We don't want addiction, because that's bad. That's clearly self-destructive behavior. The same processes that form addictions also help us form . A habit is a behavior not done consciously. We want to create healthy habits.

## What does it take to form a habit?

There's just two things that matter when forming a habit:

__Frequency:__ People who flossed more often flossed more.

__Attitude change:__ People who perceived the behavior differently. If they saw flossing as something different "wow it just seems weird to not floss before going to sleep" they were more likely to floss.

#### Why

- Habits help create a higher lifetime value. They are adding to the bottom line every month and they have a higher lifetime value.
- We have a greater pricing flexibility if the user has a habit. We can change our pricing structure.
- It supercharges growth. __Without engagement, virality is not enough. Without enagement, we have a leaky bucket, they use the product a few times, then go out.__
- Creating consumer habits increases defensibility.

If your product requires habits (unprompted user engagement), then this course will have a design pattern, a la Lean Startup. Lean Startup: Build, Measure, Learn.

The most expensive part is in the building phase. Building is expensive. So we want to generate new hypotheses for what you should build. We want to learn the context of what people believe, but we want it to come from our consumers, and we want it to be beased on behavior psychology.

> The Hook Model We want to combine the users' problem with your product's solution with enough frequency to form a habit.

Why does our business require habits?

- What problems are users coming to solve?
- How do they currently sovle the problem and why does it need a solution?
- How frequency do you expect users to engage?
- What acton do you want to make into a habit?

__If the behavior less frequently than the span of about a week, it's hard to create new habits. Not impossible, but very difficult.__

## Finding Internal Triggers and Placing External Triggers

Trigger -> Action -> Reward -> Investment -> Trigger

Trigger: Habits are built upon like the layers of a pearl. You can't just will a habit to occur out of thin air. These tell us what to do next.

External triggers: The information for what to do next is within the triggers: Buttons, police officers, billboards, word of mouth, emails.

Optimizing external triggers = Growth hacking. Product designers are good there, but not in internal triggers. 

Internal triggers: The information for what to do next is informed through an association: Emotion. 

Emotions, in particular negative emotions, are powerful internal triggers. How we feel plays a very large role in what we do. This is because it doesn't feel good! We don't want the bad feelings. 


People who are depressed check email more often. They literally use the web differently. It turns out that depressed people felt "down" more often, and in order to boost their mood, we use technology.

When we are lonely, we use Facebook. When we are unsure, we use Google. When we are bored we use Youtube, Pinterest, Glam, or the news, and these all alleviate the itch of boredom.

So, do we know the cx's internal trigger?

> "If you want to build a product taht is relevant to folks, you need to put yourself in their shoes and you need to write a story from their side." - Jack Dorsey

Jack talks about this narrative always. He literally builds out a play on how the cx might interact with his products. So everyone understands these user narratives. 

What triggers made Instagram so habit forming? Instagram is powerful in Instagram. Powerful external trigger = Facebook/Instagram.

Instagram solves the pain of losing the moment. This is a super solid itch. An association is formed this way. 20-30 years ago it was Kodak (The Kodak moment). Instagram is also a social network. People use it when they are feeling lonely, or have FOMO (fear of missing out).

#### Build Your Narrative

- Who is the user?
- What are they doing right before your intended habit? Where are they? What is the context?

Come up with 3 trigger hypotheses (emotions, routines, situations).  Which internal trigger occurs most often? Every time -----, the user feels -----.

Every time they feel bored, insecure, the user ---. "Every time the user feels lonely, they open Facebook". "Every time they feel insecure in their financials, they open Mint.com."

We have to attach the external trigger when the internal trigger fires.How can we be in the line of site to hit the figure? How might we be in front of the user at that time?

Think of crazy ideas, because it turns out that what's crazy today is possible in the future.

## Action

The simplest action in anticipation of a reward.

How simple is simple? A scroll on Pinterest (cool pics), a search on Google (information), a push of Play on Youtube gives you rewards.

>For any behavior to occur, we need MOTIVATION, ABILITY, and a TRIGGER.

Edward Deci: The energy for action  (how much we want to do something).

#### Factors: 

- Seeking pleasure (Sex stuff targetted to a teenage boy)
- Avoid pain
- Seeking hope (Obama campaign poster)
- Avoiding fear
- Seeking acceptance
- Avoiding rejection

This is used in ADVERTISING! Ads want to change intending outcomes and behaviors.

Ability: Six factors. Time, money, physical effort, brain cycles (how difficult something is to understand), social deviance (how often do we see other people doing the behavior), non-routine.

Non-routine: Just the fact that I've done something similar before means that I would like to do it again in the future. We call this __practice__, or "I've been doing this so long that this is what I do."

Ex: Using Google. People are so averse to switching from Google because anythine else "just looks weird". So novelty is a liability. When the interface is too new, it's hard to use. Ex: QR code. It was just too new and too outside the routines of how people use their phones.

>Simplicity is a function of your scarcest resource at that moment.

Does the user have enough time? Is money a barrier? Does it have a high cognitive load? Or is it simply too deviant? What is the user's most lacking resource, and how do we supplement it?

Should designers move motivation or ability first? Ability first. It is VERY DIFFICULT to increase motivation. When we design the path for the user to be simple, to be easy to use, we're using the existing gravity for the user to use.

So banking on ability is the context of what we want to do. Big brands can't make their products easier to buy because they've already reached full penetration already, so the only other axis they can move is to make people more motivated to use.

In technology, we always want to focus on ability.

Twitter: The intended behavior is to get the user to sign up. Just two very very clear actions: "Sign in" or "Sign up". 2009, it was a "what is Twitter". If the intended action is to learn what Twitter is, then the landing page should have stuff that helps peopel know what it is.

Consider the path that users are when they want to solve the problem. Internal trigger -> Product Interface -> Reward/Pain Alleviation.

Ex: Quora. Internal trigger is boredom (curiosity). When the user feel bored, they open the app. Product interface is (log-in), then they just start scrolling and reading. The boredom is alleviated already. There is something entertaining to occupy them.

Map the path user take to scratch their itch.

What is the scarcest resource? Where is the action most difficult?

Time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, non-routine/new.

## Variable Rewards

Nucleus Accumbens: Part of the brain that is activated when we crave: sex, objects of desire, (junk) food, and technology.

Were Olds & Milner simulating pleasure? No, actually. __It is not about providing pleasure, but simulating the stress of desire. Our reward system activates when it _anticipates reward_, not when the reward actually comes. This is the itch that we want to scratch.__

The unknown is fascinating. When the question was asked, maybe your attention perked up, and that's exactly why stuff such as movies/books capture our attention, because of the mystery.

B.F. Skinner, when he offered rewards on a predictable schedule, the pigeon would quit the lever when they were hungry. When the food pellet was intermittent, the rate of response that Skinner observed the behavior actually increased. When there is mystery, the stress increases. Habit forming technology uses these type of rewards:

#### Tribe: Social Rewards.

The search for social rewards: They have a variable component that come from other people. Empathetic joy, partnership, competition, sex. Things that have an element of mystery that you feel good from other people, are awesome. Social networking, when Mark Zuckerberg got married, 1.2M liked it. There is a lot of variability in social media: "how many likes", "what comments appear".

In sports, we associate with other people. We wear colors, pay more for hotdogs, etc. We value recognition and cooperation: check out Stack Overflow. We feel that when someone posts in Stack Overflow, you get points, and you get badges, and the most valued contributors work on the site. Thousands of people administer the site, the badges are not for decoration, they are for status, and they are an embodiment of how people respect you, in the tribe of engineers.

_Social rewards must come from people, not machines._ Receiving a reward from the machines wasn't actually a meaningful reward. Ex: Google News, the reward is inauthentic and not meaningful because it wasn't from the tribe, whereas in Stack Overflow, it comes from people you care about.

#### Hunt: Material Rewards.

Money! When a gambler plays on the slot machine, there is a variable component to what they receive. A job also has a variable material reward, based on "what will the bonus will be".

Ex: "Ross Dress For Less", this company has done well. JC Penney, when every variable reward was removed, its sales tanked. At Ross, you shop by your size, and you see single, individual items that are different. It entices the customers into "the treasure hunt", or variable rewards of the hunt, special deals for the individual item.

__This is why scrolling feed is super popular, because it is the hunt for variable rewards. And if I want more, all I need to do is just flick! Scrolling is much like pulling the lever on a stock machine.__ The master of this is Pinterest. It is "searching and searching for what the next reward might be".

##### Self: Search for Self-Achievement.

These are things that feel good. Leveling-up in games reflects MASTERY and COMPETENCY. The same with filtering through email in a phone.

Autonomy. People need to be in control. We feel this reactance reflex when we hate it. When the product is too intrusive, people hate it. If users feel that they are tricked, then game over. Things have to be "I want to", rather than "I have to".

Finally we want to have infinite variability. We get to do things longer. Ex: Social networking. Infinity varaiblity sustains interest longer. Feeds are almost always replaced by something else. Build variable rewards that satiate the users' itch, but leave them wanting more.

## Investment

This is getting the person back to the hook. We want a multiple-use product. We want people to come back habitually, with little or no conscious thought.

Users "invest (money, personal data, social capital, time, effort, emotional commitment)" into the products to increase the likelihood of using the product in the future.

>Investments load the next trigger of the hook.

There are certain investments that the user can make to get the user back. Ex: Email or SMS, they are loading the next trigger when you send the message out. There are no messages, you just do it in anticipation of a future reward. When someone sends a message back, it gives you an opportunity to re-engage.

Ex: The Pinterest Pin It button on Chrome's browser makes it  easier for people to pin directly into Pinterest. This is brilliant because they identified the "fear of missing out", and they coupled the Pin It button with Chrome's Bookmark button. Remember: New habits aren't created, they are just built upon.

#### Pinterest Hook for a Consumer

- Trigger: Facebook, Twitter, word of mouth.
- Actions: Scroll. Very hard not to do.
- Reward: See interesting objects (hunt).
- Investment: Repin, follow, comment.

#### Pinterest Hook for a Curator

- Trigger: External trigger: Emails and notifications. Internal trigger: Fear of losing content, boredom. Also, "I want to know what Jenny did!"
- Action: Log in.
- Reward: What did friend post? (Tribe) Any interesting objects? (Hunt)
- Investment: Install Pin It button, Pin, Re-pin, follow, comment.

The more I do this, the more I satiate the fear of losing content, and it also resolves boredom.

>The Investment phase stores value, improving the product with use.

This is important because in the real world, stuff depreciates, but in the virtual world, stuff actually appreciates. The more content you store in your music library, the better it becomes. The more data I load into Mint.com, the better it helps in dealing with my personal finances. The more followers, the more valuable Twitter becomes to me, and the more incentive for me to retweet. Finally, reputation, the more stored value I have means I can literally use the store to make more money on the sales of my products and services. The more I use a product, the higher my services become.

>Investments create preference.

It turns out that our investments literally change our perceptions of our behavior. __Asking users to do a bit of work _at the right time_ can be crucial.__ This is _after the reward_, we are putting something after the reward happens.

## Final Thoughts

We havea certain responsibility when changing our user behavior. The world is full of problems to fix. Help others sfind meaning. Engage them in something important. The tactics in Hooked have been used for time-wasting and for nefarious processes. Build the change you want to see in the world.






What are 3 testable ways to make the action easier?




Brain cycles/physical effort.


Review your flow: Is the reward fulfilling, yet leaves the user wanting more?

Brainstorm 3 ways users search for the variable reward.

- Tribe: Gratification from others.
- Rewards of the Hunt: Things, money, or information.
- Rewards of the Self: Mastery, completion, competency, consistency.


What can we ask our users to do to keep them returning? It's crucial that it happens after the reward.

What investment can we put into our user experience?

- Load the next trigger.
- Store value.
