- Trivia: When you are bored in face-to-face conversations or don’t want to interact with others, do you slowly start using your phone and divert your attention away from the person?
- Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way.
- *Not all phone use is a sign of addiction, even if the volume of use is high. A loss of control in how the phone is used and psychological dependency is an indicator of addiction.*
- People often get addicted to the phone because they want to escape from reality, gain social karma, cope with stress caused by social anxiety and low self-esteem, follow their greed for social validation, likes, and other types of rewards, or play rewarding games.

## Indicators of problematic phone use

- You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.
- You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.
- Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.
- You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.
- You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.
- Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.
- You feel bad about yourself and you go online to feel good but you end up feeling worse looking at what others are doing. Such compulsive phone use is likely to emerge from other mental health issues.

## Statistics

- According to a 2019 report, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. The quarantine has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.
- The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.
- Phone addiction goes hand in hand with anxiety and that anxiety often lowers the motivation to engage with people in real life. This is a huge problem because re-connecting with people in the offline world is a solution that improves the quality of life. The unnecessary drop in motivation because of addiction makes it that much harder to maintain social health.

## Overcoming

- Schedule a time for unmonitored phone use. Rewards will occur at an exact time.
- Interrupt your habitual routine - identify the context in which the habit occurs, the trigger that kick-starts the habit, and the narrative about the habit ("I can use a strategy to use my phone in a limited way so I don't stay an addict and still enjoy it.")
- Introspect about your expectations: Why are you doing what you are doing? Is it a rewarding experience? Is it a social interaction? Are you waiting for some to approach you? What psychological needs are your phone compensating for, is it the need for belongingness, social approval, or a need to feel desired. Try to satisfy those needs in healthier ways.
- Delete apps if there is something particular that triggers usage.
- Categorise your phone activities and assign a time per activity.
- Try to have a good time in a way you feel your social needs are met. Avoid satisfying all your social needs on social media. Social media use and mental health have a complex relationship, you might want to learn more about that here.
- Manage your need for distractions and stimulation - you can give your brain a better, richer replacement like learning a new skill, socializing, healthy gaming, sports, dating, grooming, cooking, reading, journalling.n

## Hacker News

- Inconvenience based solutions don't address the problem: using apps to restrict phone use, physically hiding the phone etc. Once you leave those carefully constrained conditions, you are more vulnerable than ever. Not to mention the contradiction with the core issue that it's a symptom rather than a cause.
- It's easier to think of it as an addiction to browsing rather than an addiction to the phone itself. You have to catch yourself during any browsing moment in any context to eventually make progress. Be intentional in almost every action instead of going on auto-pilot, although obviously resting at the end of the day is fine. It's more a general philosophy than a hard rule meant to exhaust you.
- *The eventual goal is a rich life where you no longer feel the need to distract yourself.*
- Habits are related to our environment. Your brain is probably wired to your current living arrangements and taking a vacation- with the added caveat that you know you have no internet- means no behaviors. This is why people can easily get sober in rehab and then come home and instantly relapse.
- Quit services cold turkey when you can. "Use in moderation" sets you up for failure. This is because the services learn about your habits every day and they become extremely good at guessing what content keeps you in. E.g. Youtube has recently switched to a new search function that improves its search results based on your previous searches. It's scarily accurate. Many of my peers said they noticed it too but didn't think too much of it.
- This also applies to games. Your AoE villagers didn't announce "+1 wood" when their axes hit a tree. Consider such features in a game an attempt to manipulate you. If you can't disable the them in game, think of it as the insult to your intelligence it is, and uninstall it. If necessary, once such features are disabled, it's easier to see if the content of the game is a good way to relax and balance out the day's hard work.
- This article and the HN thread were two of the most informative and entertaining things I've read in a while. And it led to some immediate action. I deleted Instagram (the only social media app I had) and I deleted or unpinned the browsers. I already had all notifications turned off. Honestly, if you're going to do just one thing do that. My friends who haven't honestly look like Pavlov's dogs.
