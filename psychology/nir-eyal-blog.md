## How to Clear Your Computer of Focus-Draining Distraction

- People performed poorly on cognitive tasks when objects in their field of vision were in disarray as opposed to neatly arranged. Same with digital environments.
- Extra distractions act as triggers, causing us to do unimportant tasks--costing us wasted time and focus.
- Sluggish computing: every open tab on your web browser uses your machine's processing and memory resources.
- Removing triggers: Bartender app.
- The more tabs open, the less likely I was to reboot my machine and web browser, preventing updates and further slowing down my computer.
- Articles to read later go to Pocket.
- Open tabs I think I might need some day go to Evernote.
- Every Friday: Friday "flush" to clear out clutter.

# [HOOKING USERS IN 3 STEPS: AN INTRO TO HABIT TESTING](http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/04/hooking-users-in-3-steps.html)

The truly great consumer technology companies of the past 25 years have all had one thing in common: they created habits. This is what separates world-changing businesses from the rest. Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter are used daily by a high proportion of their users and their products are so compelling that many of us struggle to imagine life before they existed.

## HABIT TESTING

Habit Testing fits hand-in-glove with the build, measure, learn methodology espoused by the lean startup movement and offers a new way to make data actionable. Habit Testing helps clarify three things: 1) who your devotees are; 2) what part of your product is habit forming, if any; and 3) why those aspects of your product are habit forming.

Once you have a site or app live, you can begin collecting data. Habit Testing does not necessitate collecting data about everything — just the right things — so setting up the appropriate analytics is critical. In order for Habit Testing to be successful, you need to date stamp the path users take while using your site.

“Who are the habitual users?” First, what is a devoted user? Ask yourself how often a user “should” use the site. That is to say, assuming that some day all the bugs are worked out and the product is perfectly lickable, how often would you expect a habitual user to be on the site?

A good short-cut might be to take an average of how often you and the people in your office use your own product. Of course, more is better. Twitter was born within Odeo, the company Biz Stone and Jack Dorsey originally founded, because the engineers couldn't stop playing with it.

One thing to note: the more frequently your product is used, the more likely it is to form a user habit. That's not to say that web products that are used rarely can't be good business, they just aren't habit forming and thus have different characteristics. Viable, though non-habit forming businesses tend to be more transactional and require constant outreach to customers to stay top-of-mind.

*Expedia, Travelocity, and the rest, are used too infrequently by their average customers to form a habit, so they constantly compete for attention.* These are viable, even profitable companies, but since they are non-habit forming products they are open to greater competitive threat. Products used daily naturally create barriers to entry in their markets.

This is where hiring a stats whiz can prove exceedingly helpful. Instead of pulling your engineers away from their crucial jobs building the product or even worse, getting your business people to do it, consider hiring a grad student fluent in statistics to help you quantify how many of your users are hooked.

## CODIFY

But how many devotees is enough? My rule of thumb is 5%. Though your rate of active users will need to be much higher to sustain your business, 5% is a good benchmark to being Habit Testing.

However, if at least 5% of your users don't find your product valuable enough to use as much as you predicted they should, you have a problem. It may be time to go back to the drawing board and rework your vision. But assuming you've exceeded that bar and you've identified your habitual users, the next step is to codify the steps they took using your product so you can understand what hooked them.

Sift through the data to determine if there are similar behaviors that emerge. What you’ll hopefully discover is a “Habit Path”, a series of similar behaviors shared by your most loyal users.

For example, in its early days, Twitter discovered that once new users followed enough other members, they hit a tipping point which dramatically increased the odds they would keep using the site. Every company has a different set of actions that devoted users take; the goal of finding the Habit Path is to determine which of those steps were critical for creating devoted users.

Now that you know the Habit Path, the next step is to create hypotheses about what it was along that path that tipped users from passers-bye to devotees. This phase is also a good time to talk to users in person to learn more about why and how they use the product. Habit Testing is meant to illuminate what is unique about these “earlyvangelists” and find insights that can be generalized to the rest of your users.

# Why Do Fads Fade?

At the heart of each episode is a problem the characters must resolve. Challenges prevent the resolution of the conflict and suspense is created as the audience waits to find out how the storyline ends. Invariably, each episode's central conflict is resolved near the end of the show, at which time a new challenge arises to pique the viewer's curiosity.

*The cycle of conflict, mystery, and resolution is as old as storytelling itself, and at the heart of every good tails is uncertainty. The unknown is fascinating, and strong stories hold our attention by waiting to reveal what happens next.*

Researchers have shown that people who read a story about a character actually feel what the protagonist is feeling. As we step into the character's shoes we experience his or her motivations. We empathize with characters because they are driven by the same things that drive us.

Why do people lose interest in a few days or weeks? Why does the power of these variable rewards seem to fade away? Ex: Zynga.

*Online games like FarmVille suffer from what I call "finite variability", an experience that becomes predictable with use.* While Breaking Bad built suspense over time, eventual interest in the show waned when it finally concluded. With plot lines known and the central mysteries revealed, the show just wouldn't seem as interesting the second time around.

*Businesses with finite variability must constantly churn out new content and experiences to cater to their customers' insatiable desire for novelty.* Contrast with companies making products with infinite variability, like games. Games played to completion offer finite variability while those played with other people have higher degrees of infinite variability.

Content consumptions is finitely variable, but content creation is infinitely variable. Platforms like Youtube, Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter all leverage user-generated content to provide visitors with a never-ending stream of newness.

# Is Some Tech Too Addictive?

- The attributes that make certain products engaging also make them potentially addictive.
- There is no way to separate the fun of gaming, for example, with its potential for abuse.
- Social media is exciting principally because it utilizes the same variable rewards that make slot machines compelling.
- Spectator sports or television watching, enjoyed by billions of people, share common traits with the primary function of illicit drugs — they provide a portal to a different reality.
- If what we’re watching is engaging, we experience the high of being mentally elsewhere.
- Sports bar people: they will be in a state similar to "the zone".
- Only 3% of users walk the 25,000 daily steps Dr. Chance was logging. Continued repetition of a behavior despite adverse consequences is very small. Studies show that relatively few people are susceptible to addiction and that even those who do get addicted quit their dependencies when they change life stage or social context.
