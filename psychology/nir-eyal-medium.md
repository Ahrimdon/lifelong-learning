A potential driver for the growth of the Kardashian game is a tactic that exploits user error and can unwittingly post messages to players' Twitter accounts.

It's called the *viral oops.*

Unlike viral loops, which are actions users take in the normal course of using a product to invite new members, viral oops rely on the user effing-up.

Example of Viral loop: If a user wants to send cash to another, the receiver generally opens a Paypal account to redeem the funds. When the new user wants to send money themselves, they'll usher in more new members and the loop continues.

*In viral oops, the user doesn't realize what they've just done.*

When you follow someone in the fake Twitter in the game, you also follow the real-world Twitter. The game also posts "I am now an E-list celebrity in Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Come join me and become famous too by playing on iPhone!", and includes a link to download the app.

# Why Behavior Change Apps Don't Work

A few words, placed at the end of a request, are a highly effective way to gain compliance, doubling the likelihood of people saying "yes."

*"But you are free to accept or refuse."*

The "but you are free" technique demonstrates how we are more likely to be persuaded when our ability to choose is reaffirmed. This also works over email.

Schell said the difference comes down to whether the behavior is a "wanna" versus a "hafta." The difference between things we want to do and things you have to do is, according to Schell, is "the difference between work and play … slavery and freedom … efficiency and pleasure."

Furthermore, Schell believes maintaining a sense of autonomy is critical to enjoying an experience. Schell points to the work or Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, whose Self-Determination Theory identifies a belief in one's own freedom to choose as a key requirement for sustained motivation.

Too many well-intentioned products fail because they feel like "haftas", as opposed to things they "wanna" do. When faced with "haftas," our brains register them as punishments so we take shortcuts, cheat, skip-out, or in the case of many apps or websites, uninstall them or click away in order to escape the discomfort of feeling controlled.

MyFitnessPal: It was forcing him to log down everything that he was eating, and he didn't want to do it, especially if he forgot to log or he ate something bad.

Fitocracy: There were other people who send over virtual encouragement and asking etc. You get connected with like-minded people and sharing words of encouragement, exchanging advice, and receiving praise are rewarding. In fact, a recent study in the Netherlands found social factors were the most important reasons people used the service and recommended it to others.

*Social acceptance is something we all crave and Fitocracy leverages the universal need for connection as an on-ramp to fitness, making new tools and features available to users as they develop new habits. The choice for the Fitocracy user is therefore between the old way of doing an existing behavior and the company’s tailored solution.*
