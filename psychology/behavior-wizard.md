## GreenDot Behaviors

Green Dot behaviors are often used in the beginning stages of complex behavior inductions. For example, if a company is interested in creating a loyal, repeat customer, they might start off with a small introductory offer. This can then lead to more extensive, prolonged relations and, eventually, habitual purchasing behavior.

If you want someone to do a new behavior just one time, you are seeking a Green Dot Behavior.

Ex: Health: Eat quinoa for the first time.

Since Dot behaviors occuro only once, the suject must have enough knowledge to successfully complete the action on the first step. Otherwise, frustration/quitting may occur.

To achieve a Green Dot behavior, you must Trigger the behavior when the person is both Motivated and Able to perform it. If any of these three eleemtns are missing, the behavior will not occur.

Either you can: add a motivational element, increase the ability of the subject by providing a guide, or increase the motivation of the subject by explicitly highlighting the benefits of the action.

## GreenSpan Behaviors: You want somesone to commit to a behavior for a period of time.

Ex: Health: Commit to use new toothpaste for a week.

To succeed, you should boost motivation (downplay factors that demotivate), increase the ability to make the commitment, and deliver the trigger when motivation and ability are high.

Frame the new behavior in a way that reduces costs (money, effort, time, etc.) and increases benefits.

Re optimal time remember that fear (or negative expectatons) is the perimary reason people resist Green Span Behaviors. Will the new activity take up too much time? How much effort does the ongoing behavior require? And, what if I change my mind?

Savvy persuaders downplay these fears. 

The transition from a new habit to a familiar habit is not automatic and often not very predictable. What we need is to break down the habits into simpler smaller Green habits that are easier to perform.

## GreenPath Behaviors: You want someone to commit to a new behavior for the long term.

These imply a life change: Marriage, or something smaller. Remember + Motivation + Ability + Triggers. What you can do is to couple the trigger with an existing habit, increase the perceived ability by making the behavior easier to do, and to reduce demotivation by making the behavior more familiar.

Simplify the behavrio. Ex: Consuming flaxseed oil. explain where flax seed oil is kept in the grocery store, and give suggestions how to use this oil. INSTRUCTIONS AND SIMPLIFICATION ARE VITAL FOR MOST GREEN PATH BEHAVIORS.
