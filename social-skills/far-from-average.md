## HOW TO TALK TO GIRLS | NEVER RUN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY | KEEP A CONVERSATION GOING
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSeCitB1co8)

Starting a Conversation:

- Statement, question, or statement + question.
- Conversation between guys is closed. Conversation between girls is open-ended.
- Everything a girl says to another girl is another bridge that leads to another part of the conversation.
- Nail polish -> "I wish I got my nails done."
- Start practicing everything someone says as a bridge to the next part of the topic.
- Opening her up: if she replies with one or two word answers, this will close the conversation. The best way to open a girl up is with long statements + questions.
- Voice tonality, speech rate, and volume are important: girls make instantaneous judgments about you re: confidence. What they check for: them thinking if you think that she's out of her league, being insecure via being too quiet/soft.
- Speech rate: when they're nervous, guys speak faster than normal. Confident: speaking slow and naturally.
- Remove filler words: by removing those, your talk will seem purposeful and direct.
- Keep the conversation of the girl.
- Keep the conversation emotional. She wants to talk about things she feels strongly about. All girls think primarily with their emotion.

- External confidence: praise from other people. The boost you get when you wear new shoes. Fleeting.
- Internal confidence: when you ask your brain and it says "yeah I can do that."
- Life is just like a video game, if you fail you get experience points and you get stronger.
- When you master multiple skills, this is how you get the supreme confidence.
- External tools: new clothes, haircuts.
- When you're thinking about doing something, your brain asks yourself how to do things, and it makes a calculation based on what it knows before.
- In real life, failing a social situation doesn't kill you. You learned what you did wrong, so you can do it better next time. As long as you continue to fail in a skill, you get better at it with time.
- "Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage."
- Just like a game, when you reach a level of skill, you can't lose it.
- All-around confidence: the humble self-assurance that attracts others.
- Start with your biggest insecurities and master them.
- Self-esteem is how you value yourself. The more skills you have, the more you have to offer.
- Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit at home and think about it. Go out and get busy.
