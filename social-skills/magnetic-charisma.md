## Charisma Deconstructed

- You feel intimidated if you haven't trained for the proverbial charisma marathon.
- This is an accumulation of experience, practice, and only some natural ability. Charisma comes from `charis`, which means "gift of grace".
- Humans avoid discomfort and seek pleasure. We are just capitalizing on human nature and conforming our actions to what gives people more pleasure. If given the choice, you will probably prefer to stand in front of a cupcake store versus a cow farm.
- Focus, visionary, kindness, authority charisma.
- **Focus charisma:** When you make people feel that you are solely focused on them, and you two exist in a world of your own.
- **Visionary charisma:** When you believe in a greater cause and can rally people to see and believe in that cause.
- **Kindness charisma:** You make people feel like you truly care and can understand their emotions. Their empathy is attractive.
- **Authority charisma:** You give the impression that you are infallible, have the answers, and deserve to be followed.
- People and relationships are the currency of happiness in our lives.

### Devote Your Attention

- The core of devoting your attention is to be present with someone and be engaged in them, the moment, and what's happening around you. It has nothing to do with what you look like or what you're wearing. It doesn't even have anything to do with the people themselves.
- Conan: The guest is the center of Conan's world, and everything for the next 10 minutes is geared toward focusing on the guest and making them feel as comfortable and welcome as possible.
- FOMO will prevent you from enjoying any present moment because you'll constantly be comparing it to something better (which will always exist).
- **We don't like people who are otherwise preoccupied and make us feel small.**
- When someone is speaking, look into their eyes 80% of the time, and when you are speaking look into their eyes 50% of the time.
- More eye contact is not necessarily better. The more you use without a break, the more uncomfortable you will make someone.
- Distinct emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust.
- **Those who use it are universally seen as more confident, trustworthy, and honest. We know this to be not necessarily true, so eye contact is really about appearances and perception.**
- **Clear signal of attention: Nod more.** Use nodding as a non-verbal punctuation by nodding slowly, and nod at only the appropriate times when someone is speaking.
- Following up is the art of asking question after question of people--and disregarding what you want to say and focusing on their topic or thoughts.
- **You can make more friends in two months by becoming truly interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. -Dale Carnegie**

### Show Your Confidence

- Powerful because charismatic or charismatic because powerful?
- **Power comes from the way you carry yourself, how you respond to people, and how much self-confidence you possess.**
- You don't need to be rich to be perceived as powerful, as long as people sense that money isn't an issue and you have the ability to make things happen.
- You don't need to be strong to give the impression that you are physically powerful, as long as people perceive you to have the ability to take care of physical issues and acts.
- When we appear confident, we are more attractive and draw people to us.
- Self-confidence, where does it come from? It is the belief that no matter what comes your way, you will be able to handle it in one way or another, and accept the outcome.
- Take a moment to shed your modesty filter and think about what you're objectively better at compared to most people. What are the steps required to reach that stage? **Regardless of what you're good at, you likely went through a difficult process to arrive at your state of mastery and experience.**
- The narrative you tell yourself about yourself is likely wrong. Logically, you might know your narrative is incorrect, but internalizing that knowledge emotionally is a much bigger challenge.
- Since the lack of confidence is an emotional roadblock, you are going to need an exponential amount of evidence to counterbalance it.
- Appearing intelligent: A widely recognized marker for status and power. Know a little bit a bout a lot. It's easier to gain a dearth of knowledge versus deep domain knowledge. You don't have to know everything, but you should have a passing knowledge of everything you feel might come up in conversation.
- Body language: take up space with your body. Think that you are imitating a model.
- Avoid nervous behaviors such as fidgeting, protecting your face and neck, shifting your weight from foot to foot, or slumping over and hiding behind handheld objects or fixtures in the room.
- Speaking: More slowly, and more scarcely. Speak from your diaphragm clearly and powerfully, and at a volume where no one will have to ask you to repeat yourself. Create the perception that you have carefully weighed your words before you speak them, and that they carry significance.
- Other people are supremely uncomfortable with silences and will rush to fill them.
- People who are weak and insecure tend to feel compelled to interact with their environment by verbally throwing spaghetti at the wall. In other words, they keep chattering in an attempt to capture people's attention.
- **You aren't out to impress anyone, so don't act like it.** The subconscious meaning of these words is that your words count. When you speak, something will happen. When you speak, you speak with power.
- Power isn't financial, nor is it tied to authority or position. The truth is people respect and aspire to those with power, and there are many ways you can create a sense of personal power around you to become more charismatic.

### Exude True Warmth

- Attention and focus without a warm, emotional element just becomes a job interview. It's cold, clinical, and can make people uncomfortable.
- True warmth stems from a complex understanding of people and the ability to deeply empathize.
- Read more fiction: feelings are never outright said, they are described in detail, and we may encounter many situations that cause our protagonist distress or joy. But the feelings are never named, so how do we know what they are feeling?
- Fiction. Getting into the heads of the characters. That's because that's where all the good stuff happens--you find motivation, emotion, and reasons for all of their actions that shape the story.
- Visualize alternate lives. Orwell: people aren't poor because they are drunk and lazy, they have real problems.

### Choose a Role Model

- The Fresh Prince: the epitome of a charismatic personality. He says what he wants, is amazingly likeable, is comfortable being the center of attention, is confident to the point of being arrogant, can verbally spar with anyone, and is flat-out hilarious.
- Asking what your role model would do diverts your attention from the situation at hand.
- Modeling: It is a method where people learn by observation and subsequent imitation alone, without instruction or explicit guidance. We have a tendency to emulate behavior.

### Be a Role Model

- Unflappable. We enjoy spending time with someone who inspires us to be better an makes us feel like everything will just be okay.
- Becoming comfortable with the awkward parts of life is the understanding that not much good happens inside your comfort zone, and there are always proverbial vegetables in the meal of life.
- Positivity. To be a role model, focus on working toward something and aspiring toward something. Work on seeing the good in anything and the side benefits, small as they might be.
- Charismatic people wear their hearts on their sleeves. There is a level of genuineness when people do not hold back on expressing what they are feeling inside. There is a filter for tact, but there is still a very direct line from their thoughts to their words. People will feel you are consistent and trustworthy because you express what you think.
- When you put yourself out there first and don't appear to care, others will follow your emotional lead. Vulnerability is when you allow your weaknesses and flaws to show and accept them.

### Shine Your Spotlight

- Politicians: make their constituencies feel heard and validated.
- Compliments: the things that people have made a conscious choice about. Compliment them on their clothing, fashion style, hairstyle, and living space. These are personal and impactful. **By complimenting someone on something they've clearly chosen with purpose, you acknowledge and validate the statement they have chosen to make about themselves.**
- Compliment: Manners, the way they phrase certain ideas, their opinions, their worldview, and their perspective.
- Reacting: follow them emotionally. When you figure out the primary emotion someone is trying to convey, show it to them as they are conveying it. When you notice that they are getting heated at certain points, get heated with them.

### Goal Alignment

- The goal you set for yourself influences all of your actions.
- If your goal for the current year is to maximize your income through whatever means possible, you are going to work more, apply for more jobs, and have fewer free time.
- If your goal is to carpe diem, then you are probably going to work as little as possible, perhaps even quit your job, and use your weekends to the max.
- Job interview: all of our stories involve us as the good guy. Everything will have a positive slant, and we will glaze over our flaws or spin them into strengths somehow.

#### Self-amusement and entertainment

- Make it fun for yourself and make it fun for other people. Your goal when you speak to other people in a social setting should be to engage them and make it not boring for them and yourself.
- We want to be around people who make us feel engaged, happy, and positive. You could even call that an alternate definition of charisma.
- Be proactive and manufacture the type of interaction you want by making the first move.
- Everyone has a quirky and fun side--they are people too, and they have friends who act in silly ways. And yet, people tend to act in a freer and more unfiltered manner with anyone besides their coworkers.
- **To be entertaining (to others) and amusing (to yourself), it's your duty to dig below the surface and find what makes people beautifully abnormal or noteworthy.** Share your unconventional methods or views on a subject. This strays from the norm, and will make people react in ways that break their scripts and templates. In other words, a conversation they haven't encountered before, and one that isn't boring.
- You don't become friends with someone because they meet your ideals or standards. You just find each other amusing and entertaining, and that's the entire basis of friendship at the outset.
- Self-amusement begins with viewing others as opportunities to joke around. Develop the mindset of interacting with people and things in your daily life just to see what happens when you poke them, and it will serve you well in conversations.
- Self-amusement: you initiate it. You can't rely on others to do the work for you, nor expect to be entertained by others like a sultan.
- Taboo topics: more personal in nature, so in addition to creating an interesting line of conversation, you've just made it more personal and deep.

#### Build trust and comfort

- Tell the truth, and make it appear that you value the truth. It's important to be precise and exact with facts and numbers. Commit to dealing with the exact and precise truth and then dealing with in head-on, instead of hoping that it won't come up and dealing with the messy aftermath.
- Hold yourself and others accountable, and don't blame others or deflect responsibility.
- Element of genuineness so you don't appear fake, and show sincere reactions. It shows that you are making judgments off of what you see, and that you aren't biased or making judgments based on preconceptions.
- When you refuse to talk about someone behind their back, you'll appear to be more loyal and show an awareness of what is right and wrong. When you can create a safe space for people to inhabit, they'll lower their guards.

### Speak Their Language

- Evolution: Favoring the familiar/people who are similar to us. We tended to stay alive more frequently when we stayed close to humanoid shapes and shadows.
- If you feel that someone is the same status as you, or even higher, you're simply going to want to make a good impression on them and connect more. This bodes well for any conversation.
- Mirroring: Reflecting on elements about things that you are similar to them about. If you conduct yourself in a way that you talk like them or you use the same tone of voice and mannerisms, it is easier for them to relate to you because they feel that you are familiar enough to include in their comfort zone.
- Analogies.
- Speak their language.

### Charisma No-Nos

- Just let go/Belief Police. You're a part of the BP if you have a strong need to be right, you can't stand it when people disagree, and you become consumed by imposing your thoughts on others.
- You can correct people, and you can assert your opinion. But there are ways of doing that in a less abrasive way than outright telling people they are wrong.
- Worst case scenario: defensiveness. **Relinquish your membership in the BP and let people think different thoughts from you. There is nothing at risk besides your pride and ego.**
- Sharing too much/too little. Too much: talking but not communicating.
- Be aware if people don't want to talk anymore.

### Quickness and Violations

- Better to just reply immediately, then correct yourself, rather than take time to come up with a correct answer.
- If you meet someone and they're talking about a problem they have at work, they don't expect you to solve their problem. They put it out there for the sake of conversation.
- Violations/humor: subjective, and is rooted in language.

### Effective Listening

- Divorces: not because of infidelity or money issues, but because of a failure to communicate and ineffective conflict resolution.
- People like to think they are being communicative, when in reality, they are doing the bare minimum to assuage their own feelings of guilt or obligation.
- Conversations that make people uncomfortable are often avoided, but most of them could be made far less painful if there was more effective listening.
- Listening: synthesizing what someone tells you and dropping any pretense, responding to what they said and nothing less.
- Listening isn't about you, no matter how related it is, or how funny of a joke you can make about it. It's about suppressing your urges and relinquishing the center-stage to someone else completely.
- Listen with intent: Listening for the purpose of helping the other person. Following up: putting yourself in their emotional state.
- There's often no logical explanation that will satisfy people in the light of an emotional event.

### It's Not What You Say

- Facial expressions are muscle contractions that involve the jaw and the mouth, but smiles also involved the eye muscles.
- It was only authentic smiles that would make the eyes squint.
- Posture: bad posture is when you're appearing to be shrinking so people can't see you and will ignore you. Good posture: standing tall, proud, and unafraid of attention.
- Absence of eye contact = lack of trustworthiness. It is the non-verbal equivalent of: "Hi, how are you?"
- Social touch: non-verbally showing your charismatic presence and sense of welcoming and openness. Touching socially = triggers feelings of intimacy, happiness, and openness.
- Giving high fives = correlated with team and individual success.
