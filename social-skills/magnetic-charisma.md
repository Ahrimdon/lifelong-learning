## Charisma Deconstructed

- You feel intimidated if you haven't trained for the proverbial charisma marathon.
- This is an accumulation of experience, practice, and only some natural ability. Charisma comes from `charis`, which means "gift of grace".
- Humans avoid discomfort and seek pleasure. We are just capitalizing on human nature and conforming our actions to what gives people more pleasure. If given the choice, you will probably prefer to stand in front of a cupcake store versus a cow farm.
- Focus, visionary, kindness, authority charisma.
- **Focus charisma:** When you make people feel that you are solely focused on them, and you two exist in a world of your own.
- **Visionary charisma:** When you believe in a greater cause and can rally people to see and believe in that cause.
- **Kindness charisma:** You make people feel like you truly care and can understand their emotions. Their empathy is attractive.
- **Authority charisma:** You give the impression that you are infallible, have the answers, and deserve to be followed.
- People and relationships are the currency of happiness in our lives.

### Devote Your Attention

- The core of devoting your attention is to be present with someone and be engaged in them, the moment, and what's happening around you. It has nothing to do with what you look like or what you're wearing. It doesn't even have anything to do with the people themselves.
- Conan: The guest is the center of Conan's world, and everything for the next 10 minutes is geared toward focusing on the guest and making them feel as comfortable and welcome as possible.
- FOMO will prevent you from enjoying any present moment because you'll constantly be comparing it to something better (which will always exist).
- **We don't like people who are otherwise preoccupied and make us feel small.**
- When someone is speaking, look into their eyes 80% of the time, and when you are speaking look into their eyes 50% of the time.
- More eye contact is not necessarily better. The more you use without a break, the more uncomfortable you will make someone.
- Distinct emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust.
- **Those who use it are universally seen as more confident, trustworthy, and honest. We know this to be not necessarily true, so eye contact is really about appearances and perception.**
- **Clear signal of attention: Nod more.** Use nodding as a non-verbal punctuation by nodding slowly, and nod at only the appropriate times when someone is speaking.
- Following up is the art of asking question after question of people--and disregarding what you want to say and focusing on their topic or thoughts.
- **You can make more friends in two months by becoming truly interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. -Dale Carnegie**

### Show Your Confidence

- Powerful because charismatic or charismatic because powerful?
- **Power comes from the way you carry yourself, how you respond to people, and how much self-confidence you possess.**
- You don't need to be rich to be perceived as powerful, as long as people sense that money isn't an issue and you have the ability to make things happen.
- You don't need to be strong to give the impression that you are physically powerful, as long as people perceive you to have the ability to take care of physical issues and acts.
- When we appear confident, we are more attractive and draw people to us.
- Self-confidence, where does it come from? It is the belief that no matter what comes your way, you will be able to handle it in one way or another, and accept the outcome.
- Take a moment to shed your modesty filter and think about what you're objectively better at compared to most people. What are the steps required to reach that stage? **Regardless of what you're good at, you likely went through a difficult process to arrive at your state of mastery and experience.**
- The narrative you tell yourself about yourself is likely wrong. Logically, you might know your narrative is incorrect, but internalizing that knowledge emotionally is a much bigger challenge.
- Since the lack of confidence is an emotional roadblock, you are going to need an exponential amount of evidence to counterbalance it.
- Appearing intelligent: A widely recognized marker for status and power. Know a little bit a bout a lot. It's easier to gain a dearth of knowledge versus deep domain knowledge. You don't have to know everything, but you should have a passing knowledge of everything you feel might come up in conversation.
- Body language: take up space with your body. Think that you are imitating a model.
- Avoid nervous behaviors such as fidgeting, protecting your face and neck, shifting your weight from foot to foot, or slumping over and hiding behind handheld objects or fixtures in the room.
- Speaking: More slowly, and more scarcely. Speak from your diaphragm clearly and powerfully, and at a volume where no one will have to ask you to repeat yourself. Create the perception that you have carefully weighed your words before you speak them, and that they carry significance.
- Other people are supremely uncomfortable with silences and will rush to fill them.
- People who are weak and insecure tend to feel compelled to interact with their environment by verbally throwing spaghetti at the wall. In other words, they keep chattering in an attempt to capture people's attention.
- **You aren't out to impress anyone, so don't act like it.** The subconscious meaning of these words is that your words count. When you speak, something will happen. When you speak, you speak with power.
- Power isn't financial, nor is it tied to authority or position. The truth is people respect and aspire to those with power, and there are many ways you can create a sense of personal power around you to become more charismatic.

### Exude True Warmth

- Attention and focus without a warm, emotional element just becomes a job interview. It's cold, clinical, and can make people uncomfortable.
- True warmth stems from a complex understanding of people and the ability to deeply empathize.
- Read more fiction: feelings are never outright said, they are described in detail, and we may encounter many situations that cause our protagonist distress or joy. But the feelings are never named, so how do we know what they are feeling?
- Fiction. Getting into the heads of the characters. That's because that's where all the good stuff happens--you find motivation, emotion, and reasons for all of their actions that shape the story.
- Visualize alternate lives. Orwell: people aren't poor because they are drunk and lazy, they have real problems.

### Choose a Role Model

- The Fresh Prince: the epitome of a charismatic personality. He says what he wants, is amazingly likeable, is comfortable being the center of attention, is confident to the point of being arrogant, can verbally spar with anyone, and is flat-out hilarious.
- Asking what your role model would do diverts your attention from the situation at hand.
- Modeling: It is a method where people learn by observation and subsequent imitation alone, without instruction or explicit guidance. We have a tendency to emulate behavior.

### Be a Role Model

- Unflappable. We enjoy spending time with someone who inspires us to be better an makes us feel like everything will just be okay.
- Becoming comfortable with the awkward parts of life is the understanding that not much good happens inside your comfort zone, and there are always proverbial vegetables in the meal of life.
- Positivity. To be a role model, focus on working toward something and aspiring toward something. Work on seeing the good in anything and the side benefits, small as they might be.
- Charismatic people wear their hearts on their sleeves. There is a level of genuineness when people do not hold back on expressing what they are feeling inside. There is a filter for tact, but there is still a very direct line from their thoughts to their words. People will feel you are consistent and trustworthy because you express what you think.
- When you put yourself out there first and don't appear to care, others will follow your emotional lead. Vulnerability is when you allow your weaknesses and flaws to show and accept them.

### Shine Your Spotlight

- Politicians: make their constituencies feel heard and validated.
- Compliments: the things that people have made a conscious choice about. Compliment them on their clothing, fashion style, hairstyle, and living space. These are personal and impactful. **By complimenting someone on something they've clearly chosen with purpose, you acknowledge and validate the statement they have chosen to make about themselves.**
- Compliment: Manners, the way they phrase certain ideas, their opinions, their worldview, and their perspective.
- Reacting: follow them emotionally. When you figure out the primary emotion someone is trying to convey, show it to them as they are conveying it. When you notice that they are getting heated at certain points, get heated with them.
