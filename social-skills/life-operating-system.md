[Reference](https://lifeoperatingsystem.com/overcoming-loneliness-101/)

- Human connection is finding a commonality with another person or group of people. It's finding something that you both agree on or have experienced or are experiencing at the same time.
- When you have some identified commonality with another person, you have a connection to them. That's what connection is in it's simplest form.
- Why do you feel lonely?
  - You are focusing on the wrong kind of connection.
  - You have an inefficient mechanism for connection.
- You want deep, real, and meaningful connections. Literally everyone craves and wants this. They don't sit around pondering how they can form meaningless connections with more people than they can count. They crave true depth and significance in their connections, just like you.
- Geographical, cultural, demographic are surface level (people live in the same cities and countries and share the same demographics, yet still feel isolated).
- You can form deep and meaningful connections with people by holding the same beliefs and values. The depth of your connection will depend greatly on the emotional significance of that particular belief or value, but finding the right one will leave you feeling connected.
- Same with desires - identifying deep, personal, and emotionally significant desires will help you experience a real and significant depth of connection.
- Your vision of your ideal life is the one psychological desire where the depth or commonality really doesn't matter. If someone else holds the same vision of the life they want to live, there's a pretty good chance that you'll experience a connection with them. A life vision is a very personal and emotionally significant part of someone's life and so if they have that vision and it matches yours, there's a good chance you'll connect with them on a real and significant level.
- If you're both experiencing emotions, you will feel connected to them.
- If you're currently not experiencing connection, it could be because you're focusing on the wrong kind of connection. You might be focusing on geographic, demographic, historical, or maybe less-significant psychological connections rather than the deep, real, and personal types of connection.

- *Inefficient mechanisms for connection.*
  - When you connect on an insignificant value, make that a gateway to dive deeper and develop real and significant connections.
  - Have to figure out the times to connect on a deep and real level (not the nightclub, not in the office). Sure, you feel lonely and want to connect, but doing so in these locations and people just won't be in th mood, so.

- *Connecting with Anyone*
  - Quick fix: "And how was that like for you?" "Were you excited?" "Were you scared?" "Were you relieved?"
  - "I've never done something like that before, but it sounds terrifying/exciting/boring/rewarding. How did you find it?"
  - If they share, share in return. Talk about someone you've done where you experienced the same emotional rollercoaster. Identify your commonality and let them experience the connection by sharing that commonality with them. If they don't open up that's fine. Move on. No everyone is consciously aware of their personal experiences or feels comfortable expressing them.
  - Long term: *It's about filling your life with like-minded people who you naturally and effortlessly connect with through your shared vision of your ideal life.*
