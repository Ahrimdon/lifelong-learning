- And conscientiousness is a personality trait that can be subdivided into orderliness and industriousness and is a predictor of long term success. I
- Conscientious people are often planners. They like structure, they’re disciplined, they have their lives sorted out; they’re basically the ones that a formerly disorganized person like myself perceives as superhuman machines.
- Conscientious people aren't always the most fun people to be with. Their orderliness comes with an increased disgust sensitivity. Not just disgust for chaos, but also for people at the bottom of the hierarchy, and their miserable fate is a motivator for them to stay away from the bottom. This disgust sensitivity may be at the expense of compassion.
- They’re most likely judgemental towards others. They can’t stand others being so lazy and not taking responsibility, and they have a low tolerance for people violating norms and rules. However, they’re also very judgemental towards themselves. Not functioning properly themselves fills them with shame and guilt; that’s why they’re more prone to the fear of failing.
- But they could structure their lives in a way that their goal – that star in the sky – stays visible at all times and illuminates the path to reach that goal, instead of changing goals and ambitions every two weeks. It also helps them to weed out the excesses of their lively social existence, and form a small group of good friends that assist them in their journey.

## Orderliness

- When I create ‘order out of chaos’ I look at life in three different areas: (1) my outside world, (2) my ego extensions, and (3) my mind.
  - Creating order in our surroundings will make our lives at least a bit more predictable. Create order among the aspects of our lives we correspond with - finances, relationships with people, a job or an education.
  - Ego extensions - cleaning our room means cleaning ourselves etc. Same thing with a partner.
  - The mind: Keep our minds in the present moment and let go of worry and rumination. When our minds are calm, we can focus more easily on tasks, and get things done, which is the next aspect of conscientiousness - industriousness.
- Discipline:
  - Act of doing the same things over and over and over again. 100,000 words can be broken down into many small sessions.
