- "How's it going" => "How's life" (how is the side project going along, how is your family doing, how are they managing the workload.
- "What's the latest on so-and-so?" *A one-on-one is not a reporting session. It's not an accountability tool. It is a way to unearth what's going on in your team, and what an employee is thinking and feeling.* => "Can you tell me about what's been most surprising about working on X so far?"
- Instead of "how can I help you", suggest "I think I'm being too hands-on this project. Should I back off and check-in with you only bi-weekly? What do you think?"
- "How can we improve?" => the problem with this vague question is they invite vague answers.
  - "What do you think is the most overlooked area of the business?"
  - "Where do you think are we behind in, that other companies are excelling at?"
