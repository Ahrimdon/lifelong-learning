# Gracious, A Practical Primer on Charm, Tact, and Unsinkable Strength

- We dedicate so much time and energy to make sure the world is aware of us--look, here's a picture of my breakfast. Here are my thoughts on that stupid thing someone said on Twitter! I take up physical space and matter in the universe and my opinions matter, I like to think.
- *The world remains indifferent to us, and yet we take it so personally. And this bit of existential dissonance is reinforced constantly as we move through life indifferent to the humans around us.*
- Every human is just as human as you are--they did not begin existing at the moment you hear their ringtone on the bus. Thought it is very easy to assume otherwise, each person you will encounter is just as much in their own head as they in yours.
- They have a favorite food, a lucky pencil, a happiest moment, a worst moment.
- Writing the newspaper Sunday profile--she got to follow people around doing the thing they liked.
- People who were nominated to be profiles--they had a real interest in people that they were with and the ability to be fully present during their interactions.
- *How do you live a life where kindness and assurance, instead of anxiety and irritation, are the emotional guideposts?*
- There is an intoxication to the gracious people among us, a charisma that originates not from a perfect smile or any of the outside trappings of beauty, composure, or coordination. What I began to realize in the course of these interviews is that these gracious people moved through the world radiating an invisible but beautiful space of compassion and caring, one that they are happy to share with any human who wants to be a part of it.
- Best Society is not a fellowship of the wealthy, it is an association of gentle-folk, of which good form in speech, charm of manner, knowledge of the social amenities, and instinctive consideration for the feelings of others are the credentials.
- *Graciousness is about finding a way to be comfortable in your own skin, and then using that security to make others feel comfortable, too. It is an outlook leading to actions that lets you feel good about the day or at least your actions in it.* Graciousness is about facing the world with kindness and compassion rather than with ambivalence or just suspicion.

## Graciousness, What's Its Deal

- Grace: to favor. Grace applies to all sorts of things--how you move through the world physically, socially, emotionally, but it almost always implies performing whatever you're doing well and seemingly effortlessly.
- It is not:
  - Being born with a certain amount of money, born in a certain place, ethnicity, gender, class, etc.
  - A gracious person is not a doormat. They give everyone what they want but only because they do so as a by-product of the strong sense of who they are, what they want, and how they live life.
  - It is not an inherent trait, like your shoe size or eye color. It is a skill, and you have to work at it.
- Dictionary: Marked by kindness and courtesy, marked by tact and delicacy, urbane, characterized by charm, good taste, and generosity of spirit.
- I want to be the person when someone is being awful and needs to be called out, but also recognizes that this is a human being who deserves to be treated humanely.
- I want to feel comfortable gliding through scary social situations ranging from walking into party by myself to hosting a big event.
- I want to be able to make friends wherever I go; to welcome guests graciously to my house and never let them see me set.
- I want to feel at ease whenever I'm talking to hog farmers or Savannah society.
- I want to defend my ideas and my freedom of speech in a way that leads to understanding rather than Twitter catfights.
- *She said that as she moves through life, she tries hard to always deposit something positive, something kind, something uplifting, something helpful in her wake.* Am I leaving something lovely, something unremarkable, or something ugly?
- I am capable of impressive ungracious acts. (Brief example: Just today, my best friend was telling me about her very painful breakup, and I interrupted her to reference a completely unrelated YouTube video. WHY DID I DO THAT?!)
- We all do and say things we regret—rushing through life with our head down, rarely giving the present moment—and people—the thought and care they deserve. That kind of attention is rare enough that when you are with someone gracious, you know it. Or, more accurately, you feel it. You feel smarter, kinder, more loving, more capable.
- We live in a time when it’s so easy to be rude, so easy to always think about ourselves first. We spend a lot of time talking about ourselves at each other, and not as much time listening.
- But I have learned that graciousness is a skill that anybody can develop—like all skills, you develop it by practice—despite how quickly our individual worlds are spinning on any given day.

### Why Be Gracious

- People will want to be around you.
- A sense of personal integrity and comfort within your own skin.
- You will be shocked by how much of it will be reflected right back at you, by how kind other humans are when they are given the slightest opportunity or opening.
- Being water-resistant to the sadness and meanness of those around you. You will not feel personally hurt every time someone doesn't treat you exactly the way you'd like to be treated.

- The laws of graciousness are basically the same, and one of those laws is recognizing the humanity of whoever is next to you at that moment.
- You encounter people who:
  - People whom you love with all your heart, never disappoint you.
  - People whom you love with all your heart who do let you down.
  - People whom you sometimes love, sometimes other.
  - Indifferent people.
  - Unfriendly people.
- The most boring action: think of borrowing a book at the library, how many people had to take a certain kind of action (studied at librarian school, went to the office) in order to facilitate every single thing that happens to you all day. The people who created the library, the roads, the food, shelter, etc.
- To be gracious is to live in a way that acknowledges all these extremely convenient miracles that allow you to get the books, products, and services that you desire. *No matter what else is going on, you will find yourself a lot happier and less stressed if you take a few moments every day to remember how many things had to go right in order for you to get that cup of coffee that took a few more minutes than you wish it had.*
- Though your time with Others may be at most temporary, no one is disposable. To treat people otherwise dishonors not only them but also this entire neat system that we live in, in which we depend on one another in ways both tiny and unimaginably huge. It dishonors the heart of what you, and what all of us, tend to want: to be treated as though we matter, with civility.
- *No matter who chaotic the universe is, we can be peaceful in the middle of that if we know what is and what is not up to us.*
- When you approach each person and situation without expectations or entitlement, but rather just with the principles that you want to live by, then whatever you get back is just fine with you.
- To be gracious is to bring ease and comfort into a world that is anything but easy or comfortable, and you feel that ease most acutely within your own skin.
- Nora: Someone who is just always so happy ("I can't believe it!").
  - The fact that homemade toffee is available to eat.
  - The wonders of a Soda Stream.
  - A holiday wreath I made.
  - That we are enjoying a tasty pork dish.
  - The fact that I was going to be in LA for a few days.
- Coming from a place of humility and wonder, she is dying to hear about your life when you sit down with her. For Nora, there is nothing more interesting in the world than other people.
- "If you thought constantly about yourself, I think you might not be a very interesting person."
- The foundations of graciousness: gratitude, attention, and caring for other people.

### The Seven Saboteurs of Graciousness

- Correcting the behavior of others is not gracious, but we do need to react to other people's behavior, even when that behavior is perhaps less than perfect.
- *The self-absorbed.* Also manifests as self-loathing.
- *The combative.* This can be temper, or it may be the need to play devil's advocate to the point where it become an excuse to say things they know will hurt others under cover of "exploring every angle."
- *The thoughtless.* Prone to saying off-color or hurtful. "They mean nothing by it."
- *The crude.* Purposely says or does things that are completely inappropriate to the situation and makes everyone feel ill at ease.
- *The meddler.* Has so many thoughts on what you should do, "that is totally unacceptable." Offers unsolicited advice.
- *The resentful.* Happiness is zero-sum, someone else's joy means there is less available for them. They never stop keeping score.
- *The enigma.* ???

### Think in Terms of "Us"

- You can tell a marriage is over when the couple isn't thinking in "us" terms anymore, but rather as a you and me who have different, competing objectives.
- This has to happen in ever relationship, no matter how brief.
- What action on your end helps the "us" in the rental car counter example meet both your need to get a car and their need to do their job completely?
- This is a very gracious position: you are neither people pleasing, nor are you thinking just about what you want in this given moment regardless of how that impacts the person on the other end of the transaction.

### Theories of Grace

- The actual word for "grace" in Hebrew is `chen`. `Chesed` is more like compassion or loving-kindness, and they go together.
- If you understand God as existence itself, then grace is bestowed equally upon everyone. It's simply reality, and it's not always pleasant.
- If you're hung up on judgment, then you're stuck in the binary of "I like this, I don't like that." I think that results in a tightening of the body and the breath and therefore the mind and the heart, and you find yourself incapable of moving graciously through any of it.
- *Even though I can have compassion toward you being trapped, I don't have to stick around and deal with it.*
- Radical hospitality is the acceptance of whatever is happening--thoughts, feelings, sensations, behaviors--of whatever is around us without resisting.
- *We have rights as well as you, one of which is to exclude from our circle all persons whose manners or habits are distasteful to us. You talk of rights. You cannot blame others for exercising theirs.*

## Virtually Gracious

- Graciousness is about focused attention, kindness, and empathy and about moving deliberately in accordance with your values. The Internet is none of those things.
- It gives us so much whenever we want it. It loves us. It hates us. It tells us how to get where we're going, it tells us that we will never get there. It is in short, a perfect addiction, and we all could probably use a little less of it.
- *We could use less of the parts that take time away from what we are actually here to do. Those include wallowing in the hateful opinions of anonymous strangers, comparing everyone's outsides with your insides, getting in fights with people we have never even seen, and encouraging you to live a life that looks great on paper.*
- Answers to "who are these people?"
  - It doesn't matter, their ire is theirs, not mine, and not my business or concern.
  - They, like all of us, fear death and know it could happen to them or the ones they love, and if they can figure out a reason why this completely unreasonable thing happened, then they can blame the victim and transfer that fear into scorn, which is a much easier emotion to feel.
  - Because a lot of people are really terrified and hurting, angry that their lives are very different than what they thought they would be, and while the real cause of everything in life is so complicated and multi-faceted, it's much easier to feel angry than powerless.
  - Nothing, but that doesn't matter when you feel like something terrible is happening and no one is listening to you. Because we all need to feel like we are heard, like we are humans. We need others to know we exist and if we feel like they don't, then the fastest way to get there is the Internet equivalent of screaming at a waitress because they are worried about your marriage.
- *Tattlers are always listeners and are frequently the atrocious writers of anonymous letters, for which they should be expelled from society.*

### Overarching Principles of Gracious Internet Communication.

- Decide what you need from it every time you sit down.
- What you say is forever, make sure you can stand by it.
- If you don't have something useful to say, you don't need to listen. Like you would never go to a KKK meeting so why lose sleep over every nasty comment made by anonymous strangers.
- Always watch your hostess. The Internet is still too young anyway.
- Do not let the Internet control any more of your life than you choose.

### Internet Experiment to Perhaps Try

- Every time you touch the Internet, ask yourself why are you going to that website.

#### Principle 1: Decide what you need from it every time you sit down.

- You outputting yourself: Combination diary, photo album, newsletter, which is okay, unless you measures an experience by the online reaction to it. If it is not posted on Instagram, did it even happen?
- Checklist:
  - Did I say what I wanted to say clearly and without personal attacks that would undermine or let people ignore the heart of my argument?
  - Am I saying this to the correct audience, whether that's completely public or a select group of friends?
  - Do I need to say this now? If so, why now instead of in 30 minutes, an hour or tomorrow?
  - Am I prepared for a variety of responses to this, many of which I will find helpful/supportive and a few which I may find absolutely repugnant?
- What do I want my reader to feel? What do I want them to think? What do I want them to do?
- *Is this meant to inspire jealousy or envy? Are you trying to demonstrate something about yourself and your life? Is this post useful, funny, smart, true?*
- What you take from the Internet: What do you feel after consuming a website? Sad, frustrated, lonely, angry? Are these emotions a reasonable response to whatever you're consuming? More importantly, are these emotional reactions doing something for you or the world?
- Reading an in-depth article about a cause or injustice that you care about. You feel bad reading about it but it makes you grow your compassion for the world and hopefully you will be moved to take some action in your own life to make a change.
- You are feeling bad about yourself, so you fall down the hole of looking at everyone else's presentation of their life on social media. You feel resentment and then you decide to hate-read something, knowing that it will upset you and not bring you anything but further anger.
- We cannot control very much in life--there will always be unhappy people who wish to spread the affliction, terrifying things happening in our country and the world.
- You can control what you read, whom we respond to, and how we react.
- *The next time you are in this dark place, let your best self gently whisper in your ear, "Daryll, what or whom is this helping?". If the answer is "nothing, except my foul mood", then it's time to shut that laptop or set the phone down.*

#### Principle 2: What you say is forever; make sure you can stand by it.

- Private messages and e-mails are never, ever private.
- "I'm not afraid to engage with people I disagree with because I'm curious about their lives and their views."
- "I don't post anything about what I am going through in a given moment. Until you have perspective on your own experiences, you're not a good judge of what's going on in the here and now."
- If you have Facebook friends that disagree with you on certain things, then maybe you don't have to post this for everyone.

#### Principle 3: If they don't have something to say, you don't need to listen.

- "In every aspect of life, there are unsavory people and situations that you have to deal with. If you can take a step back and remove yourself from the immediacy of the situation and remember it's not the end of the world, it helps."
- There are some people who are just going through rough times, and there are also some people on the Internet who are mentally ill.
-. If you're not getting anywhere, you’re not getting anywhere, and you need to stop expending energy where it's not going to be useful. Plus, admit it: You’re not there to have your mind changed, either.

### Principle 4: Always watch your hostess.

- Email:
  - A short but timely response is almost better than a long, delayed one.
  - Be extra careful with your tone, because there is just only the text.
  - Do you really need to send the email? Maybe a phone call can solve this.
- Facebook:
  - Privacy settings and groups are your best friend.
- Instagram:
  - Not everyone wants every picture taken of them on the Internet.

#### Do not let the Internet control any more of your life than you choose.

- We are not hired to be e-mail-responding robots.
- After-hours, if you have a phone, excuse yourself, and set expectations if a call or important email will be arriving during a visit with someone.
- Tell people that I don't check my email everyday, and if there is something urgent, I would appreciate a text at the number I have just for that purpose.
- If on hiatus from social media, then broadcast that at the top of your profile or page.
- "At the end of my life, when I look at how I spent my time, my contribution to the world, my body of work, will I be proud of that, or will I feel regret?"
- The Internet is your tool. You can reclaim it and use it or not use it however you want.
- You don't have to make it permanent—decide and post that you are on a 2-week or a month-long break. You will continue to exist. You may miss out on a few things, but they are very unlikely to be of essential importance to your life. And who knows what you will notice, achieve, and experience when you're using all of that brain space that's currently taken up with the ever-updating feed.

### Theories of Grace

- For me, grace is the always-present, never-ending love of God for all humans, for all creation. It’s God willing the best for us. The world now is too dangerous and too beautiful for anything but love.
- When my daughter was born, I knew I would love this person and there was nothing she could do to change it. I can only look at her through her beauty and the potential of whom she was created to be. The rough edges and the meanness and the occasional cruelty are anomalies. It’s not her, it’s her wrestling with her demons.
- *If I'm capable of loving a little bit like that, then I understand that when we sin, God isn't angry that we misbehaved. He’s heartbroken that we’re paralyzed and not fully dancing in the kingdom as we should be.*

## Grace Under Fire

- Life will throw every last thing it can at you, darlings, and I wish it wouldn't, but I promise it will. You don't get to choose what, when, or how the trouble looks, but you do get to choose who you are through these moments, tiny or enormous.
- Challenges:
  - Someone is being unkind.
  - You must stand up for something you believe in.
  - Things do not go the way you thought/wished/assumed/needed them to.
  - You are caught in the middle of others' conflicts.
  - Something is leaving your life, or you are leaving theirs.
  - The center cannot hold.
- *The less I understand why something is happening in the moment, the more understanding and growth will ultimately come to me.*
- We don't know what our capacities are until they are tested, and learning how to approach difficult situations with a sense of calm is an invaluable skill.

### Someone is Being Unpleasant, Unkind, or Unfair

- "I think the vast majority of rude or offensive behavior is unintentional; it almost always comes from lack of awareness."
- Try to give others the benefit of the doubt, because you don't know where they're coming from.
- "I'm sorry you're upset. Is there something I can do to help you?", then "Sorry, I wish there was something I could do to help."
- Co-workers: "Is there something I can do to improve the relationship between us?"
- Cruel betrayal: Make sure they realize how much they have hurt you and give them a chance to explain themselves. "I don't want anything to do with you, and I'm sure you know why." "Why did you do that?"
- Forgiveness: You can forgive them or not, and resume, not resume, or resume relations at the moment.

### You Must Stand Up For Yourself

- Most people don't have to play roles in your life, and if what they're saying isn't useful to you, then you don't have to listen. Nor do you have to educate them.
- Boss: "I don't have much to say about XYZ and would prefer to chat about anything but XYZ." "I know we have different views on this."

### Things Are Not Going Your Way

- The worst: "The gulf between How You Think Life Should Be versus How It Actually Is."
- Let go of expectations you have that you know will never be met.
- "What's the worst thing that can happen? So what? You'll survive."
- The Ring Theory:
  - One person is most affected by Susan's cancer, and that's Susan, and the next ones are her family and friends.
  - The person in the center can complain to anyone, and the more you are affected, the more you can complain.
  - This is why you cannot just say that you support so and so if you are not a member of the marginalized group.

#### Big Problems

- What is not up to you:
  - Whether you meet the right person
  - Whether you can have biological children
  - When people die
  - Whether another person behaves the way you wish they would
- What i up to you:
  - Whether you spend a large portion of your time lamenting what you do not yet have instead of working to make a life that you enjoy and is full of loving people
  - Whether you give yourself time to grieve, whether that loss is of a person or the idea of what you thought your life was going to be
  - Whether you accept and allow someone to be cruel to you on an ongoing basis
  - Whether you accept without judgment anything you may feel
  - Whether you choose to stay in the present rather than fly backward into regret or forward into fear
  - Making the conscious choice to turn your attention toward gratitude and grace.

- "I know you're really angry, but I love Susan too, so maybe I'm not the best person to talk about this."
- Whatever happened happened between them, and you will never get an entirely objective account. Nor would it matter even if you had one.
- *The more emotion is involved, the further we move from the story of what actually happened and more into the narrative of our hearts.*
- What people need is "I get it. I hear you.", and even if you haven't been through something, conveying that you have a sense of what they're going through and giving empathy. That doesn't mean you have to agree with them.
- *"I have a friend who was in prison for a long time for a violent felony. And he said to me, 'Imagine if, for the rest of your life, everyone's perception of you and every detail boiled down to the one worst day of your life, the most horrible moment, the worst thing you ever did, and that's it, that’s all you are.'"*

#### Negotiation

- *Remember the definition.* Discussion aimed at reaching an agreement.
- *Know your goals.* Know your must haves, like to haves, and deal breakers, that way, you can be focused on what you want instead of being anchored by their initial offer.
- *Do your research.* Salary calculators.
- *Empathy.* Frame the request in terms of how it benefits your counterpart and it will be more likely that you get what you want and it will make them feel that you are considering their perspective.
- *Practice.*
- *Know your counterpart.* Do they like numbers or narratives?
- *Get comfortable with silence.* Make your ask and then drop the mic.
- *Listen.*
- *Ask questions.* "Did I understand you correctly that ...?"
- *Follow up.* Don't underestimate the power of a quick thank-you note.

### The Center Cannot Hold

- Also remember that the only thing you ultimately have control over in this crazy world is yourself, and no matter how bad things get, you will serve yourself best by being gentle, kind, and patient—with those around you and most of all with yourself.
- We want to rely on an institution or other people to fix our problems, and we assume they can. When I realized the medical world didn't know how to fix his problem, it felt like everything was crumbling underneath me.
- The combination of being able to temper your own anxiety and fear and being willing to ask for help is a pretty good plan.
- There's a defensiveness that causes us not to ask for help, because we don't want to be seen as vulnerable. But one of the most beautiful things you can do is to allow someone to help you. Before it happened, I valued my privacy and wanted to handle it on my own, but once I realized I was in over my head, I was pretty open about it.
- Argh.
  - Acceptance: Accept where you are and what’s ahead of you, whatever it is.
  - Resilience: You choose to be resilient, you choose to show your strengths.
  - Gratitude: For people around you, for everything.
  - Happiness: Happiness is a choice.
- "When my kids were killed, I didn't want to live. I just wanted to die. And my sister came and spent a week or so with me and she was sitting in my house, and I wasn't talking, wasn't doing nothing, and she said, "What's the matter with you?" and I said, "I'm waiting to die. The Lord took my kids and now he can take me; I'll wait."
- If you do all you can do, I don't care what you've got to go through, you can stand it. You might not like it, but you can get through it, if you're doing your part.

## How To Be Gracious To Yourself

- Graciousness is about kindness and generosity to humans; since you are a human, you should therefore reap the benefits of being treated well by yourself and be able to accept the kindness offered to you by others without trying to talk them out of it. True graciousness begins with feeling at home in your own skin.
- It's very hard to feel comfortable in a room when somebody is berating your every gesture, and when that somebody is living in your head, it can feel like there's not place in the world to relax and experience a bit of peace.
- At a party, the host sets the tone. And since you are the host of your own life, everyone in it is going to have a lot more fun if you can relax a little bit and enjoy yourself.
- In order to make others feel comfortable and loved, you must feel comfortable and loved. This is what separates graciousness from compulsive people-pleasing, which in the end, almost never works and is a swift path to madness.
- *If you aren't going to say the types of things you say to yourself to your friend, then you are probably self-abusing yourself.*
- Treat yourself like your soulmate. You will always be with yourself. You are your own Wilson.
- "My students are always talking about how, when they started looking at the way their mind works and what their thoughts are, how much of it is criticisms of themselves."
- Mindfulness: Sitting quietly, and observing your thoughts without judgment or criticism. Mindfulness really is just listening to your own brain. Then do it again and again, until your brain quiets down a little bit and you start being able to let the negative thoughts pass you by rather than getting stuck in a spiral.
- When you find yourself ABSOLUTELY NEEDING RIGHT NOW to correct something about yourself, ask yourself: "What about this bothers me? Why is this a problem? Am I feeling unnecessary guilt and shame? Does this actually make sense and is this actually real? See where this might be coming from.
- "I treat myself like a sensitive friend--fragile, emotional, and perhaps sometimes disturbed best friend you've had. Maybe she's been through a lot, and maybe she continues to go through a lot, but you really, really like her."
- If it's not helpful, I don't say it, or at least I don't focus on it. "No, if you're not going to learn from this, then move on. Or if you are going to learn from it, do that, then move on."
- Dwelling on the Past: You are not a magician, so don't. We cannot change it, and what do we accomplish by dwelling? Right.
- Does hating ourselves for things we did in the past sound productive? Right. This is why running from self-abusive thoughts is what one should do.
- It's like holding to a dead squirrel. Bury the squirrel. Put down that dirty plate.
- There is nothing wrong with technical thinking (things like how to bake a cake, how to solve a physics problem), but opinions, judgments, memories, dreaming about the future, they have no essential reality.
- Example, when cleaning the oven, why not just clean the oven instead of thinking of stupid internal monologues.
- Practice labelling your thoughts as a way of understanding what your internal monologue actually consists of. "I am having a thought about the past. I am having a thought about being angry. I am having a thought about myself." This helps you realize how stupid those inner thoughts are.
- What is the story you are telling yourself?
- If I'm doubting myself or my desirability to men because I'm a single gal and I'm looking for a lifelong partner--I reflect back on the story of my life.
- "I've had wonderful relationships over the years that did not end in marriage or partnership because I hose that." I try to focus on what I know to be true while still being humble and reasonable.
- *Viewing yourself as a person worthy of dignity and respect makes it easier to be your highest self.* It will allow you to stand up for yourself in ways that don't unnecessarily hurt others. It will allow you to go to bed at night knowing that you've acted and communicated in accordance with your values. It gives you the ability to step away from yourself for a moment, to know that while yes, you feel sad right now, that's okay, you won't feel sad forever.

### Saboteurs

- "I'm going to take action and apologize right now. Doing those things now. Done. I've done what I can do, and we need to move on, because the rest of the world has."
- "Why does THAT person appear to have something that you don't have?" "Cool. Let's pause and remember that comparison is the thief of joy. Instead of throwing my emotional energy into that sinkhole, I will turn my thoughts to five things that I'm grateful to have in my life."
- (Whatever nasty thought about a group of people you don't belong to that embarrasses you as you think it.) "Thanks, but I have enough of a job worrying about myself. I'll let this group pass their way since it's none of my business."
- (Random stupid thoughts.) "Noted."
- (Self-absorbed thoughts.) "That's a thought about me, all right! Now, back to living in the actual world.
- "If only this other person..." "Well you can't control other people. Work on yourself. That's a full-time job, okay?"
- "WHY DID YOU DO THAT?" "Uh this feels like a little too much punishment for so and so. Whatever."
- "I think the art of grace, for me, comes not in doing those things that come naturally but in those situations where you find yourself tested and stressed and conflicted and you're still doing the right thing and still exhibiting grace."
- To me, service to others is the rent you pay for living on earth, and you have a fundamental obligation to give back, especially those of us who have been afforded the opportunity to be in a situation where we can advocate for ourselves and advocate for others.
- *Make a difference to those around you by changing the game.* Don't be content doing what has always been done. *Think of how you can make it better, how you can make it more efficient, how you can leave it better than it was when you found it.* Everything that I do, even in my personal life, I think, How do I leave this better than when I found it? Is there any tangible evidence of me having been here? What can I point to that I can say I changed the results of the situation?
- If you are gracious and kind and polite, people will help you. If you are rude and obnoxious and overbearing, why would anyone want to help you do anything? You can catch a lot more flies with honey than vinegar. You can be true to who you are.
- "I always dress nice because I don't want there to be any confusion on who is in charge when I walk in the building."

## Gracious In, Around, & Generally Regarding the Home

- I love walking into my house, because it's mine and because I've learned a lot of valuable lessons.
- Your house is yours, and you get to control this space. You probably love it because it:
  - It keeps you warm and dry!
  - It contains almost everything you own and love!
  - People whom you don't care for are not allowed to come inside!
  - You can waft around naked, say stupid things, and not get judged.
- For every object in the house:
   - "Do I love this?"
   - "Why do I let this remain in my personal space?"
   - "Where does this item live?"
- People should match their homes.
- When someone walks in the door, what will they see? If they're going into the living room, what would their eyes land on? And then I take that little spot and make sure there is something beautiful there for them.
- Having flowers at home are awesome. Plant them in the garden and bring them inside.
- You want the seating to be comfortable.
- The things on the wall don't match up perfectly, but all of them have a story. These are the places and the people I've loved, they remind me who I am. They also tell my guests something about me, create an opportunity for starting a conversation, and set a tone for what kind of home a traveler has just meandered into.
- Gracious home: Welcoming, cared for, tidy, comfortable, lived in, full of interesting things.
- Lighting/dimmers: With lamps, you can have exactly as much light as you want, where you want it.
- The true aces up your sleeve for smells: expensive candles.
