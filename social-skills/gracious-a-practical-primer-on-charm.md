# Gracious, A Practical Primer on Charm, Tact, and Unsinkable Strength

- We dedicate so much time and energy to make sure the world is aware of us--look, here's a picture of my breakfast. Here are my thoughts on that stupid thing someone said on Twitter! I take up physical space and matter in the universe and my opinions matter, I like to think.
- *The world remains indifferent to us, and yet we take it so personally. And this bit of existential dissonance is reinforced constantly as we move through life indifferent to the humans around us.*
- Every human is just as human as you are--they did not begin existing at the moment you hear their ringtone on the bus. Thought it is very easy to assume otherwise, each person you will encounter is just as much in their own head as they in yours.
- They have a favorite food, a lucky pencil, a happiest moment, a worst moment.
- Writing the newspaper Sunday profile--she got to follow people around doing the thing they liked.
- People who were nominated to be profiles--they had a real interest in people that they were with and the ability to be fully present during their interactions.
- *How do you live a life where kindness and assurance, instead of anxiety and irritation, are the emotional guideposts?*
- There is an intoxication to the gracious people among us, a charisma that originates not from a perfect smile or any of the outside trappings of beauty, composure, or coordination. What I began to realize in the course of these interviews is that these gracious people moved through the world radiating an invisible but beautiful space of compassion and caring, one that they are happy to share with any human who wants to be a part of it.
- Best Society is not a fellowship of the wealthy, it is an association of gentle-folk, of which good form in speech, charm of manner, knowledge of the social amenities, and instinctive consideration for the feelings of others are the credentials.
- *Graciousness is about finding a way to be comfortable in your own skin, and then using that security to make others feel comfortable, too. It is an outlook leading to actions that lets you feel good about the day or at least your actions in it.* Graciousness is about facing the world with kindness and compassion rather than with ambivalence or just suspicion.

## Graciousness, What's Its Deal

- Grace: to favor. Grace applies to all sorts of things--how you move through the world physically, socially, emotionally, but it almost always implies performing whatever you're doing well and seemingly effortlessly.
- It is not:
  - Being born with a certain amount of money, born in a certain place, ethnicity, gender, class, etc.
  - A gracious person is not a doormat. They give everyone what they want but only because they do so as a by-product of the strong sense of who they are, what they want, and how they live life.
  - It is not an inherent trait, like your shoe size or eye color. It is a skill, and you have to work at it.
- Dictionary: Marked by kindness and courtesy, marked by tact and delicacy, urbane, characterized by charm, good taste, and generosity of spirit.
- I want to be the person when someone is being awful and needs to be called out, but also recognizes that this is a human being who deserves to be treated humanely.
- I want to feel comfortable gliding through scary social situations ranging from walking into party by myself to hosting a big event.
- I want to be able to make friends wherever I go; to welcome guests graciously to my house and never let them see me set.
- I want to feel at ease whenever I'm talking to hog farmers or Savannah society.
- I want to defend my ideas and my freedom of speech in a way that leads to understanding rather than Twitter catfights.
- *She said that as she moves through life, she tries hard to always deposit something positive, something kind, something uplifting, something helpful in her wake.* Am I leaving something lovely, something unremarkable, or something ugly?
- I am capable of impressive ungracious acts. (Brief example: Just today, my best friend was telling me about her very painful breakup, and I interrupted her to reference a completely unrelated YouTube video. WHY DID I DO THAT?!)
- We all do and say things we regret—rushing through life with our head down, rarely giving the present moment—and people—the thought and care they deserve. That kind of attention is rare enough that when you are with someone gracious, you know it. Or, more accurately, you feel it. You feel smarter, kinder, more loving, more capable.
- We live in a time when it’s so easy to be rude, so easy to always think about ourselves first. We spend a lot of time talking about ourselves at each other, and not as much time listening.
- But I have learned that graciousness is a skill that anybody can develop—like all skills, you develop it by practice—despite how quickly our individual worlds are spinning on any given day.

### Why Be Gracious

- People will want to be around you.
- A sense of personal integrity and comfort within your own skin.
- You will be shocked by how much of it will be reflected right back at you, by how kind other humans are when they are given the slightest opportunity or opening.
- Being water-resistant to the sadness and meanness of those around you. You will not feel personally hurt every time someone doesn't treat you exactly the way you'd like to be treated.

- The laws of graciousness are basically the same, and one of those laws is recognizing the humanity of whoever is next to you at that moment.
- You encounter people who:
  - People whom you love with all your heart, never disappoint you.
  - People whom you love with all your heart who do let you down.
  - People whom you sometimes love, sometimes other.
  - Indifferent people.
  - Unfriendly people.
- The most boring action: think of borrowing a book at the library, how many people had to take a certain kind of action (studied at librarian school, went to the office) in order to facilitate every single thing that happens to you all day. The people who created the library, the roads, the food, shelter, etc.
- To be gracious is to live in a way that acknowledges all these extremely convenient miracles that allow you to get the books, products, and services that you desire. *No matter what else is going on, you will find yourself a lot happier and less stressed if you take a few moments every day to remember how many things had to go right in order for you to get that cup of coffee that took a few more minutes than you wish it had.*
- Though your time with Others may be at most temporary, no one is disposable. To treat people otherwise dishonors not only them but also this entire neat system that we live in, in which we depend on one another in ways both tiny and unimaginably huge. It dishonors the heart of what you, and what all of us, tend to want: to be treated as though we matter, with civility.
- *No matter who chaotic the universe is, we can be peaceful in the middle of that if we know what is and what is not up to us.*
- When you approach each person and situation without expectations or entitlement, but rather just with the principles that you want to live by, then whatever you get back is just fine with you.
- To be gracious is to bring ease and comfort into a world that is anything but easy or comfortable, and you feel that ease most acutely within your own skin.
- Nora: Someone who is just always so happy ("I can't believe it!").
  - The fact that homemade toffee is available to eat.
  - The wonders of a Soda Stream.
  - A holiday wreath I made.
  - That we are enjoying a tasty pork dish.
  - The fact that I was going to be in LA for a few days.
- Coming from a place of humility and wonder, she is dying to hear about your life when you sit down with her. For Nora, there is nothing more interesting in the world than other people.
- "If you thought constantly about yourself, I think you might not be a very interesting person."
- The foundations of graciousness: gratitude, attention, and caring for other people.

### The Seven Saboteurs of Graciousness

- Correcting the behavior of others is not gracious, but we do need to react to other people's behavior, even when that behavior is perhaps less than perfect.
- *The self-absorbed.* Also manifests as self-loathing.
- *The combative.* This can be temper, or it may be the need to play devil's advocate to the point where it become an excuse to say things they know will hurt others under cover of "exploring every angle."
- *The thoughtless.* Prone to saying off-color or hurtful. "They mean nothing by it."
- *The crude.* Purposely says or does things that are completely inappropriate to the situation and makes everyone feel ill at ease.
- *The meddler.* Has so many thoughts on what you should do, "that is totally unacceptable." Offers unsolicited advice.
- *The resentful.* Happiness is zero-sum, someone else's joy means there is less available for them. They never stop keeping score.
- *The enigma.* ???

### Think in Terms of "Us"

- You can tell a marriage is over when the couple isn't thinking in "us" terms anymore, but rather as a you and me who have different, competing objectives.
- This has to happen in ever relationship, no matter how brief.
- What action on your end helps the "us" in the rental car counter example meet both your need to get a car and their need to do their job completely?
- This is a very gracious position: you are neither people pleasing, nor are you thinking just about what you want in this given moment regardless of how that impacts the person on the other end of the transaction.

### Theories of Grace

- The actual word for "grace" in Hebrew is `chen`. `Chesed` is more like compassion or loving-kindness, and they go together.
- If you understand God as existence itself, then grace is bestowed equally upon everyone. It's simply reality, and it's not always pleasant.
- If you're hung up on judgment, then you're stuck in the binary of "I like this, I don't like that." I think that results in a tightening of the body and the breath and therefore the mind and the heart, and you find yourself incapable of moving graciously through any of it.
- *Even though I can have compassion toward you being trapped, I don't have to stick around and deal with it.*
- Radical hospitality is the acceptance of whatever is happening--thoughts, feelings, sensations, behaviors--of whatever is around us without resisting.
- *We have rights as well as you, one of which is to exclude from our circle all persons whose manners or habits are distasteful to us. You talk of rights. You cannot blame others for exercising theirs.*

## Virtually Gracious

- Graciousness is about focused attention, kindness, and empathy and about moving deliberately in accordance with your values. The Internet is none of those things.
- It gives us so much whenever we want it. It loves us. It hates us. It tells us how to get where we're going, it tells us that we will never get there. It is in short, a perfect addiction, and we all could probably use a little less of it.
- *We could use less of the parts that take time away from what we are actually here to do. Those include wallowing in the hateful opinions of anonymous strangers, comparing everyone's outsides with your insides, getting in fights with people we have never even seen, and encouraging you to live a life that looks great on paper.*
- Answers to "who are these people?"
  - It doesn't matter, their ire is theirs, not mine, and not my business or concern.
  - They, like all of us, fear death and know it could happen to them or the ones they love, and if they can figure out a reason why this completely unreasonable thing happened, then they can blame the victim and transfer that fear into scorn, which is a much easier emotion to feel.
  - Because a lot of people are really terrified and hurting, angry that their lives are very different than what they thought they would be, and while the real cause of everything in life is so complicated and multi-faceted, it's much easier to feel angry than powerless.
  - Nothing, but that doesn't matter when you feel like something terrible is happening and no one is listening to you. Because we all need to feel like we are heard, like we are humans. We need others to know we exist and if we feel like they don't, then the fastest way to get there is the Internet equivalent of screaming at a waitress because they are worried about your marriage.
- *Tattlers are always listeners and are frequently the atrocious writers of anonymous letters, for which they should be expelled from society.*

### Overarching Principles of Gracious Internet Communication.

- Decide what you need from it every time you sit down.
- What you say is forever, make sure you can stand by it.
- If you don't have something useful to say, you don't need to listen. Like you would never go to a KKK meeting so why lose sleep over every nasty comment made by anonymous strangers.
- Always watch your hostess. The Internet is still too young anyway.
- Do not let the Internet control any more of your life than you choose.

### Internet Experiment to Perhaps Try

- Every time you touch the Internet, ask yourself why are you going to that website.

#### Principle 1: Decide what you need from it every time you sit down.

- You outputting yourself: Combination diary, photo album, newsletter, which is okay, unless you measures an experience by the online reaction to it. If it is not posted on Instagram, did it even happen?
- Checklist:
  - Did I say what I wanted to say clearly and without personal attacks that would undermine or let people ignore the heart of my argument?
  - Am I saying this to the correct audience, whether that's completely public or a select group of friends?
  - Do I need to say this now? If so, why now instead of in 30 minutes, an hour or tomorrow?
  - Am I prepared for a variety of responses to this, many of which I will find helpful/supportive and a few which I may find absolutely repugnant?
- What do I want my reader to feel? What do I want them to think? What do I want them to do?
- *Is this meant to inspire jealousy or envy? Are you trying to demonstrate something about yourself and your life? Is this post useful, funny, smart, true?*
- What you take from the Internet: What do you feel after consuming a website? Sad, frustrated, lonely, angry? Are these emotions a reasonable response to whatever you're consuming? More importantly, are these emotional reactions doing something for you or the world?
- Reading an in-depth article about a cause or injustice that you care about. You feel bad reading about it but it makes you grow your compassion for the world and hopefully you will be moved to take some action in your own life to make a change.
- You are feeling bad about yourself, so you fall down the hole of looking at everyone else's presentation of their life on social media. You feel resentment and then you decide to hate-read something, knowing that it will upset you and not bring you anything but further anger.
- We cannot control very much in life--there will always be unhappy people who wish to spread the affliction, terrifying things happening in our country and the world.
- You can control what you read, whom we respond to, and how we react.
- *The next time you are in this dark place, let your best self gently whisper in your ear, "Daryll, what or whom is this helping?". If the answer is "nothing, except my foul mood", then it's time to shut that laptop or set the phone down.*

#### Principle 2: What you say is forever; make sure you can stand by it.

- Private messages and e-mails are never, ever private.
- "I'm not afraid to engage with people I disagree with because I'm curious about their lives and their views."
- "I don't post anything about what I am going through in a given moment. Until you have perspective on your own experiences, you're not a good judge of what's going on in the here and now."
- If you have Facebook friends that disagree with you on certain things, then maybe you don't have to post this for everyone.

#### Principle 3: If they don't have something to say, you don't need to listen.

- "In every aspect of life, there are unsavory people and situations that you have to deal with. If you can take a step back and remove yourself from the immediacy of the situation and remember it's not the end of the world, it helps."
- There are some people who are just going through rough times, and there are also some people on the Internet who are mentally ill.
-. If you're not getting anywhere, you’re not getting anywhere, and you need to stop expending energy where it's not going to be useful. Plus, admit it: You’re not there to have your mind changed, either.

### Principle 4: Always watch your hostess.

- Email:
  - A short but timely response is almost better than a long, delayed one.
  - Be extra careful with your tone, because there is just only the text.
  - Do you really need to send the email? Maybe a phone call can solve this.
- Facebook:
  - Privacy settings and groups are your best friend.
- Instagram:
  - Not everyone wants every picture taken of them on the Internet.

#### Do not let the Internet control any more of your life than you choose.

- We are not hired to be e-mail-responding robots.
- If someone doesn't
