[Reference](https://booking.design/the-importance-of-feedback-74a41170dc21)

- Continuous feedback: helps us stay aligned with our personal and team goals.
- Good internal communication = key to success. We have to take the time to give each other useful feedback, so much so that he company offers extensive training in that skill.
- Motivational vs developmental: motivational = 4x the developmental. Then in the developmental feedback, provide the Options for improvement and suggest how things could be done differently.
- How to give feedback
  - Based on facts.
  - The right timing: if close to the time you observed the behavior, then do so.
  - When someone gives it to you, it should be received as a gift. "Yo man, thanks for the feedback."
- How not to give feedback
  - Don't judge.
  - Don't be vague. "I see often that when you talk to your colleagues your communication style is not appropriate."
  - Don't base your feedback on other people's opinions.
  - Don't use generalizations like "always" and "never".
  - Don't psychoanalyze.
  - Keep the feedback short.
  - Sandwich the improvement point between positive feedback.
- Using it in your daily life
  - "That's so cool, any way we can scale that to the whole company?"
- Comments
  - If I cannot give a real life example, then I might not want to deliver the feedback. It might be inaccurate and just create confusion.
