# The Being True To Yourself Approach to Change
[Reference](https://www.succeedsocially.com/truetoyourself)

- In social situations, it's better to be true to whatever your "default settings" are. People have different orientations towards socializing, and one isn't better or worse than another.
- Some common areas where people want to be true to themselves are:
  - Liking alone time
  - Not being into rote/superficial types of socializing
  - Having interests that most people don't have
  - Not being interested in things many people like, like team sports or pop culture
  - Having a quirky personality
  - Core beliefs
- If you can swing it, being true to yourself is the best way to go.
- Is it feasible to be totally, completely true to yourself at all times?
- Whatever you're like, whatever you're into, you can probably find a group of like-minded people to fall in with if you look hard enough.
- Most people have aspects of themselves that don't fit into the norm.
- Variety makes life more interesting.

# Ways People Can Be Seen As "Nice" In The Bad Sense Of The Word
[Reference](https://www.succeedsocially.com/nice)

- When you've been called "nice", it could just be a generic positive adjective, just not someone you'd choose to be friends with.
- Nice = bland and boring. They haven't done anything to really show me what their personality is like. They haven't told me anything they would lead me to believe they have interests or opinions they feel passion for. Clothes, grooming are blah and they give me no hints about what makes them tick. If you're nice in that way, you need to express yourself more and show people what you're about. Give them something to go on, even if not everyone decides they want to get to know you better, at least you're not being overlooked because you create no impression at all.
- Nice = not enough edge. In general, people like to hang out with friends who have a similar level of edge to them. A lack of edge could be like you're too wholesome (but that's subjective).
- Nice = too much of a wimpy people pleaser.
  - Putting other people's needs ahead of theirs.
  - Being too afraid of upsetting people or hurting their feelings, even if it involves something they'd rather not.
  - Being overly agreeable and going along with what other people think or want, and holding back their opinions and preferences.
  - Always appearing cheerful and friendly, even in situations where a typical person would be annoyed or sad.
  - Having a hard time saying no.
  - Having trouble standing up for themselves. People can treat them like crap or take their friendship for granted and they'll smile and laugh it off.
  - Feeling overly responsible for the emotions and decisions of other people.
  - People don't respect a person who acts too deferential and spineless. Getting past these problems involves a combination of learning assertiveness skills and accepting that it's okay, and much healthier, to put your needs first.
- Nice = Being overly giving, thoughtful, and considerate as a way to get people to want to spend time with you. They've started to believe that being nicer is a valuable social commodity that will pay off in the form of friendships, romantic relationships, promotions, appreciation, respect.
  -  Most people don't place a huge amount of value on above-and-beyond niceness. *Most humans are pretty nice. Being fairly nice is a bare minimum social expectation. Once someone meets that standard, additional niceness isn't given a ton of weight. When they're choosing to be friends with, people place importance on having similar interests and value, sharing the same sense of humor, whether they have fun together.* Extremely nice, giving people can be taken advantage of.
  - People feel uncomfortable when someone gives them too many unsolicited gifts and favors. They don't like feeling like they've been forced into a position where they're obligated to pay them back in some way.
  - Be as nice as the next person, but nothing more. Learn to draw people to you through other aspects of your personality. Get in the habit of digging into and monitoring your motivations and change course if you catch yourself thinking, "If I do these nice things for this person, I'll get something out of it."

# Behaviors That Are Non-Sexually Creepy
[Reference](https://www.succeedsocially.com/creepy)

- No need to take feedback seriously - some people use that specific word way too loosely, they call someone creepy when what they really mean is lame, odd, or unexpected. Some people say that because of an inaccurate stereotype. And some people think that harmless, everyday behaviours are creepy.
- Consider whether their complaint is legitimate or not. If it is, figure out what you need to change, or you can decide to just live your life.
- Seeming as if you're monitoring someone's activity or movements. "Like, why did they know that I did so-and-so?"
- Unintentionally sneaking up on people. This sets off the "I'm being stalked by a predator" part of a person's animal brain.
- Showing that you're trying to dig up info on someone.
- Showing you have dug up info on someone.
- Asking a lot of probing, invasive personal questions.
- Having too good of a memory for minor details about someone you barely know.
- Moving too fast with a friendship. Even if you hit it off with someone, don't be too eager about expressing those feelings or trying to move too quickly.
- Being an overly-attached, smothering friend.
- Coming across as angry and biter/like a ticking time bomb.
- Overreacting to rejection.
- Being happy and chipper in a forced way.
- Extreme oversharing.
- Casually approaching or chatting to someone in a setting where most people would be on guard.
- Being overly pushy and persistent, and not taking no for an answer.
- Being unable to take a hint about being rejected.
- Forcing unwanted physical contact on people.
- Taking photos of people without their permission.
- Making tons of jokes about hurting people.
- Having a mean-spirited, sadistic sense of humor.
- Seeming to use manipulative social techniques.
- Being extremely quiet.
- Lingering on the edge of an event and watching people, but not talking to anyone.
- Being super secretive.
- Dressing in a bad way.
- Being really into weapons, into death, into conspiracy theories, classically creepy stuff, new age shit, being in a group or organization that has a reputation to be cult-like  (but only if they are also not a normal person).

# Social Mistakes Intellectual People Can Make
[Reference](https://www.succeedsocially.com/intellectual)

- If a kid has been told from a young age that he's special for being smart, then he could base his whole sense of self-worth around that, and that his intelligence makes him better than other people.
- Sharing random trivia - it's not that other people are offended, it's just weird.
- Getting discouraged when people aren't enthusiastic about their interests. Even fellow intellectuals aren't keen to discuss every topic. People accept that they can't talk about everything they want to with everyone.
- Being showy and arrogant.
  - Cultivating an air that you're extremely intelligent. Thinking you have the answers. Stereotyping people as mindless. Toying with people and trying to lead a dumb person into unwittingly saying something embarrassing.
- Inappropriately correcting people.
- Being an overly argumentative debater.
- Being intellectually competitive in conversations.
- Being too blunt and abrasive. Typical people apply tact to everything they say, and nerds do the opposite.
- Being overly skeptical and cynical.
- Being too negative and critical. Some intelligent people think that by pointing out the flaws in everything, they're impressing everyone with how perceptive and analytical and insightful they are. They see it as a sign of intelligence to be able to spot what's wrong with something when no one else has.
- Being too much into the idea that intelligence and social skills are incompatible. You should not think that interpersonal skills and intelligence are an either-or thing.
- Overthinking and overanalysing how the world works.
