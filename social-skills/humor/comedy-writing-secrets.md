# Introduction to Humor Writing

- Humorists have one cardinal rule: Don't be inhibited. When writing, write freely. Remember: "Nothing sucks! Nothing does suck!" If you shoot down your ideas before you try to write, you will destroy any chances of creating something funny.
- Imagination: Brainstorm all the possibilities of what an object could be, and don't worry if your ideas seem absurd, the exercise is to get your imagination in gear. *Imagination is intelligence having fun.*
- "What if?" imagination allows you to realign diverse elements into new and unexpected relationships that surprise the audience, and surprise makes people laugh.
- Humor - the broad term that covers satire, sarcasm, irony, and parody. Comedy - mindless jokes meant to cause laughter. Comedy writers craft jokes that are pleasurable but insignificant.
- "I knew that I wanted to do comedy when I discovered irony. For those of you who don't know, I actually discovered irony when I was seven, which is when my mom started beating me with my own trophies."
- "I knew comedy was for me when I was the only Asian in high school who failed math."
- Benefits of Humor Writing:
  - Earn respect - To attract attention, you can be outstanding or unconventional, but they are all impacted positively with humor. It's such a powerful social lubricant because it immediately earns the speaker's respectful attention. It's psychologically impossible to hate someone with whom you've laughed.
  - Cause your words to be remembered. "On one issue at least, men and women agree: They both distrust women."
  - Reduce stress and promote relaxation
  - Earn great financial and personal rewards.

# Why We Laugh

- Two primary reasons why we laugh: we laugh out of surprise, and we laugh when we feel superior.
  - Other reasons: instinct, incongruity, ambivalence, for release, when we solve a puzzle, and to regress (react).
- Surprise: One of the most universally accepted formulas - a joke is a story, and a surprise ending is usually its finale.
  - Triggering surprise: misdirection (trapping the audience) and incongruity (when the audience is fully aware of all the facts, but someone they are observing is not).
- Superiority: Humor often ridicules the intelligence, social standing, and physical/mental infirmities of those we consider inferior to ourselves.
- *Audience members are happiest when his subject matter and technique encourage them to feel superior.*
- Incongruity: Unconventional pairing of actions or thoughts. When someone behaves in a manner that is suddenly ill-suited to the logic of the occasion. Ex: For shows like Just for Laughs, it's funny because we watch people trying to maintain dignity in bizarre circumstances. *The audience laughs the hardest when it knows all the facts of the situation, and therefore feels superior to the perplexed victim of the joke.*
  - Ex: When someone hides in the closet, it's funny because the audience knows all the facts, and therefore feels superior.
- Ambivalence: Nervous laughter to cover our recognition of rigid conventions that make us appear foolish.
- Release: It releases life's tensions and inhibitions.
  - Theory: If we feel the need to laugh, it's because we've been whipped by the day's battles and we'd like to hear or see a few others get smacked around. Misery loves company, but only if we can laugh at them and they can't laugh back at us.
