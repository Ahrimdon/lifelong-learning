# Introduction to Humor Writing

- Humorists have one cardinal rule: Don't be inhibited. When writing, write freely. Remember: "Nothing sucks! Nothing does suck!" If you shoot down your ideas before you try to write, you will destroy any chances of creating something funny.
- Imagination: Brainstorm all the possibilities of what an object could be, and don't worry if your ideas seem absurd, the exercise is to get your imagination in gear. *Imagination is intelligence having fun.*
- "What if?" imagination allows you to realign diverse elements into new and unexpected relationships that surprise the audience, and surprise makes people laugh.
- Humor - the broad term that covers satire, sarcasm, irony, and parody. Comedy - mindless jokes meant to cause laughter. Comedy writers craft jokes that are pleasurable but insignificant.
- "I knew that I wanted to do comedy when I discovered irony. For those of you who don't know, I actually discovered irony when I was seven, which is when my mom started beating me with my own trophies."
- "I knew comedy was for me when I was the only Asian in high school who failed math."
- Benefits of Humor Writing:
  - Earn respect - To attract attention, you can be outstanding or unconventional, but they are all impacted positively with humor. It's such a powerful social lubricant because it immediately earns the speaker's respectful attention. It's psychologically impossible to hate someone with whom you've laughed.
  - Cause your words to be remembered. "On one issue at least, men and women agree: They both distrust women."
  - Reduce stress and promote relaxation
  - Earn great financial and personal rewards.

# Why We Laugh

- Two primary reasons why we laugh: we laugh out of surprise, and we laugh when we feel superior.
  - Other reasons: instinct, incongruity, ambivalence, for release, when we solve a puzzle, and to regress (react).
- Surprise: One of the most universally accepted formulas - a joke is a story, and a surprise ending is usually its finale.
  - Triggering surprise: misdirection (trapping the audience) and incongruity (when the audience is fully aware of all the facts, but someone they are observing is not).
- Superiority: Humor often ridicules the intelligence, social standing, and physical/mental infirmities of those we consider inferior to ourselves.
- *Audience members are happiest when his subject matter and technique encourage them to feel superior.*
- Incongruity: Unconventional pairing of actions or thoughts. When someone behaves in a manner that is suddenly ill-suited to the logic of the occasion. Ex: For shows like Just for Laughs, it's funny because we watch people trying to maintain dignity in bizarre circumstances. *The audience laughs the hardest when it knows all the facts of the situation, and therefore feels superior to the perplexed victim of the joke.*
  - Ex: When someone hides in the closet, it's funny because the audience knows all the facts, and therefore feels superior.
- Ambivalence: Nervous laughter to cover our recognition of rigid conventions that make us appear foolish.
- Release: It releases life's tensions and inhibitions.
  - Theory: If we feel the need to laugh, it's because we've been whipped by the day's battles and we'd like to hear or see a few others get smacked around. Misery loves company, but only if we can laugh at them and they can't laugh back at us.
- Ask yourself and your own psychology: why did I laugh at this joke and not others?
- *Grand Unified Theory of Comedy: Laughter occurs when there is a violation of something benign. Slapstick, insults, strange behaviours represent transgressions of personal, social, and moral norms. To be considered funny, the violation must be harmless or at least perceived as benign.*

## Analysing the Funny

- 2 most important humor principles: Surprise and superiority. Identify how the element of surprise is used and the ways in which the audience feels superior.
- Favourite humor article or column, and highlight funny sections - how does the author use surprise to deliver the punch?
- Watching a funny comedy - why and how did humor work?
- Examine funny personal stories and anecdotes that you share with your friends to confirm how surprise and superiority play a role in the humor.

# The Recipe for Humor

- Consistency and targeted material. If you are consistent, you can make people laugh repeatedly - the ability to write funny isn't a one-time thing.
- Once you can consistently make people laugh, it's essential to target your material so you don't waste precious time preparing the wrong material for the wrong performer, to be delivered to the wrong audience, for the wrong purpose. This is true for all forms of humor writing.
- Material, audience, performer, purpose.
- Required elements: Target, hostility, realism, exaggeration, emotion, and surprise.
- Target: Humor is an attempt to challenge the status quo, but targeting must reaffirm the audience's hostilities and prejudices. Egocentric humor targets - "my girlfriend, my parents, my sex organ". Successful humorists - select targets with universal appeal. Ex: target being a mother, not specific eccentricities of your family.
  - Self: Least offensive target. Comics usually open by ridiculing their shortcomings: their physical characteristics, finances, intelligence, success. Once the audience is laughing, it's time to move on to hotter issues.
  - Sex: Men's greatest sexual concerns generally center around size, the ability to get an erection, performance, the amount of sex they're having, premature ejaculation, impotency.
  - Celebrities/politicians, places, products.
- Hostility: All of us have some hostility toward some people, thing, or idea.
  - Authority: Nihilistic humor: there is no person or thing so sacred as to be beyond ridicule.
  - Money and Business: Since everyone has personal money problems, focusing hostility on financial matters is one of the best ways to show the audience you share their problems.
  - Family affairs: family members and household affairs.
  - Angst: fear of death, coping with deformity, deprivations, neurosis.
  - Technology: Software, portability of technology that threatens our routines, surveillance, and how we can't control our environment.
  - Group differences: We hope to maintain some sense of superiority by ridiculing abnormal characteristics of others. We fear control and intimidation by people of different colors or religions, and we attempt to stereotype their physical appearances, ethnic mannerisms, colloquial speech, any unique characteristic we find odd.
- Realism: Jokes bend the truth but can also sort of lie about it.
  - Humor results from the contrast between a things as it is and ought to be, and a thing smashed out of shape, as it ought not to be.
  - This is why some children's humor is fun, because it gives us some kind of benevolent superiority. So humor should be as realistic as possible.
- Exaggeration.
  - "I saw this today in the window of Victoria's Secret: a camouflage thong. On what battlefield are you finding it necessary to disguise yourself as shrubbery with a great ass?"
- Emotion: Burst the bubble.
  - There must be a buildup of anticipation in the reader or audience. This is really nothing more than the writer's skill in using emotion to produce tension and anxiety. The writer's goal is to see that the balloon bursts with laughter, not hot air.
- Surprise.

# Play on Words

- "Two word-joke: dwarf shortage. If you're offended, grow up."
- Creating jokes from scratch: imagining what-if situations and then playing with words.
- Majority of all humor is based on plays on words. Twist on a popular cliche, aphorism, book, movie, song title, quote, slogan.
- The success of written and performed comedy based on POW depends on the performer's mannerisms and inflections and the audience's knowledge of the nuances of the language.
- Funny words: words with "K" in them are funny. Why does the "k" sound funny? Research indicates that babies associate the sound with comfort and joy.
- Names: There are just some names which sound funny because they match our stereotypical expectations.
- Cities and places.
- Foods and products: tutti-frutti, frankfurter, kumquat, Whopper, Spam, Kotex.
- Ethnic expressions.
- Numbers.
- Creating words:
  - "Truthiness" => truth that comes from the gut, not books.
  - Replacing one or two letters: "we skid you not", "Wok and roll", "Mustard's Last Stand", "Aesop's Tables".
  - Redundancies: "added bonus", "exactly right", "sum total", "free of charge".
- Double entendre: 2 meanings.
- "It" is the most popular double entendre word. "Boy, am I going to get it when I get home. Or maybe I'm not going to get it when I get home."
- "In" is the second most common double entendre word. "Isn't it great to be in June? Yes, but her sister Barbara was even better."
- Malaprop (malapropism) is an unintentional misstatement or misuse of a word or phrase, or an accidental substitution of an incorrect word for a (similar) correct one - to humorous effect.
  - "You wouldn't have won if we had." "If people don't want to come, nobody can stop them."
  - We can laugh when we feel superior about somebody mangling their English.
  - "A witness shall not bear falsies against thy neighbor. What do I look like, an inferior decorator?"
- Oxymoron: a contradiction in terms. "Fast idle, loud whisper, near miss, almost pregnant, explicit innuendo, true lies".

# More POW

- Cliches are shortcuts to comprehension we use when creatively lazy or mentally bankrupt. Humor writers can use audacious and surprising interpretations of cliches to shock an audience into laughter.
  - To achieve surprise, do a last second switch.
- The simple truth: a technique for creating humor by considering the implications of the literal meaning of such expressions, without the context of logical assumption.
  - "I was very lucky I married 'the one'. On a scale of one to ten, he was the one."
  - "How do we get there? We walk this way."
- Simple-truth construction: reexamine every major word in a phrase, reject its most common meaning within its context, and reinterpret it literally.
  - "I slept like a log last night. I woke up in the fireplace."
  - "When I got divorced, I missed my husband, but I'm getting to be a better shot."
- Comedy writers are not philosophers. We are linguistic specialists concerned with exactly what the literal logic of a word conveys.
- "I have a paper cut from writing my suicide note. It's a start..."
- "The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouthpart of the face."

# Reverses

- Add a contradictory tagline to the opening line of a standard expression or cliche.
- "I'd like to have kinds. I get those maternal feelings. Like when I'm lying on the couch and I can't reach the remote control. It's like, "Boy a kid would be nice right now."
- Reverses - practical for deflecting insults.
  - "I'm not being condescending, I'm too busy thinking about far more important things you wouldn't understand."
  - "People say to me, you're not very feminine. Well, they can suck my dick."
- Reverse construction: Set up a point of view that is cancelled out by the last few words.
- "I had the best day ever. I ran into my ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend-with my car."
- "I hate to travel. I guess it's because my father used to beat me with a globe."
- "I was driving like a maniac to get here on time. I took a wrong turn, and I see a sign that says, 'Caution: Small Children Playing.' SO, I slowed down. Then it occurs to me-I'm not afraid of small children."
- Painting humor:
  - Paint a picture with words, affording the listener or reader the chance to visualize the joke.
  - Humor can provide the writer great latitude to embellish or exaggerate with imagery.
  - Play on words depends on language subtleties to produce surprise, so only half the brain experiences the joke. When imagery is incorporated, both hemispheres are stimulated, and the result is a full-brain humor.
  - To enhance the visual nature of humor, use specificity. Candy bar = less likely to conjure up a visual cue than a specific reference (Snickers bar).

# Triples

- Three examples, three comments, or three categories.
- Setup, anticipation, punch line.
- Truth - the most effective humor is reality-based, genuine, and true. If a setup is exaggerated, insincere, or untrue, then you lose the ability to bend reality to produce the surprise punch line.
- Emotion - a solid setup includes a factual statement, opinion, or observation with a stated or implied emotion. The emotion is usually anger or hostility driven by the stupidity, absurdity, or weirdness of the premise.
- Explicit - specific and readily understood by others.
- Homer Simpson:
  - Bart, a woman is like a beer. They look good, they smell good, and you'd step over your own mother to just get one!
  - I want to share something with you: The three little sentences that will get you through life. "Cover for me." "Oh, good idea, boss!" "It was like that when I got here."
  - Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.

# Realism, Exaggeration, and Shock

- "My dad's pants kept creeping up on him. By sixty-five he was a pair of pants and a head."
- Facts and conclusions are exaggerated to build tension and surprise.
- Exaggeration: embellishing that which you've seen or heard. It's almost instinctive.
- Humor mus contain some element of truth if people are to care. If everyone knows from the beginning of a joke that any likeness to anyone living or dead is purely coincidental, they won't care, and they won't laugh.
- Humor only comes when the exaggeration is logical. Simply being ludicrous or audacious is not a skill, it's amateur.
- You have to determine how far in any direction the truth can be exaggerated without destroying credibility.
- Exaggeration also works as an understatement, which is an excellent technique for self-deprecating and insult humor.
- Overstatement and understatement:
  - "In the beginning, there was nothing. God said, 'Let there be light!' And there was light. There was still nothing, but you could see it a whole lot better."
- Shock and awe - while there is a difference between being rude and being funny, obscenities are sometimes the perfect words. When they are, they should be used. A work is not just a sound or a random combination of printed letters, each word in humor is carefully designed to penetrate the mind and create a specific impact.
