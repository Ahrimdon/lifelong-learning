- Humor is power. Humor helps build connections and relationships in ways that few other social interactions can. It makes all participants feel good, and it brings people together in shared positive expreicnes that are memorable and lasting.
- If you act like things are funny, then it's more likely to be funny and for you to get the reaction you are looking for.

- Literal, serious, and predictable comments are never funny. Tap into your inner child and learn to play more.
  - Instead of "yeah, it's too hot", just say "yeah I feel like I just walked into the Amazon rainforest".
  - Exaggerating things inspires further playful conversation. Funny people are always looking for alternative, playful ways to comment and engage in conversations.
  - Direct questions like "Where are you going" or "What are you doing" are perfect opportunities for experimenting with unanticipated humorous responses. When people expect literal answer, a lighthearted and funny response could result in easy humor because it's unexpected.
  - Rather than describe a situation in literal terms, with the right tone, timing, and body language, you can always say something with a fun, exaggerated twist.
  - *You're not going to make someone laugh every time with every humor technique, but the point is to position the social interaction near or within the play zone so you at least have a chance at creating humor. And that stars with not being literal all the time.*
  - *Humor and fun don't live in the safe and predictable. You have to be okay with a handful of randomness and a pinch of silliness. Robin Williams: "You're only given a little spark of madness, you musn't lose it.*
  - You may not always have fun, but you have to put yourself in a position to have fun. Take things on chances that aren't predictable.

# Laugh at Yourself First

- Most comedians rely on self-deprecating humor-they know their own weaknesses or shortcomings and aren't afraid to point it out in a humorous way. It's easily one of the most common comedic techniques.
- *Likeable and easy-going people are usually comfortable in their own skin and have embraced their character flaws. They are okay with being a little bit vulnerable. Such people are the first to admit they aren't perfect and are happy to laugh at their personal quirks. They're quick to admit funny mistakes or episodes of forgetfulness. They use their flaws to their advantage.*
- Beautiful actors with arrogant personalities don't attract many fans. Being okay with your own flaws helps you let your guard down, and it lets others take their guards down, too. It's a small reminder that nobody's perfect and that we're all in this together, and that's okay.
- Don't take yourself too seriously if you want to be funny. There is value of being able to laugh at yourself, it's a foundational requirement if you want to make others laugh.
- Start with honesty. Be transparent first, and the funny will come. When you take down your facade, you help others loosen up as well. The social tensions melt away, and the playfulness and fun seep into the interaction.
- Recovering from verbal blunders? Recover and make light of it next time.
- When you take advantage of mistakes instead of ignoring them, you're more likely to venture down fun and engaging tangents rather than experiencing awkward moments.

# Don't Be an Energy Vampire

- The success of a joke or story always comes down to how the words are delivered and not just the words themselves. The more playful energy and enthusiasm you put into a social interaction, the more of it you'll see reflected back from the other person.
- Ask yourself, do you more often add energy to a social interaction, or suck it away like an energy vampire? If you're sucking the energy out of situations, or if you're hard to hear or understand, nothing you say will make a difference.
- Visual body language also matters - are you stiff as a board, or are you animated?

# The Humor's in the Details

- People can say the same basic thing but receive a much better reaction cause of - a different timing, emphasis, intonation, energy, personal style. Keywords can make or break a phrase, joke or story.
- Colorful words trigger emotions and mental images. Boring words do not. However, everything you say doesn't need to be colorful or bursting with flavor. The goal is to strike a balance between a few boring words and too many detailed words.
- Absolute language: "No one should ever get a burgundy-colored birthday card." Same with the more visual and inherently fun-sounding keyword "burgundy". Instead of "I'm a chemistry teacher", how about "I basically teach kids how to play with poisons".
- "That swanky bar is where all the rich people go to." "Sure, I can smell the swank from here!"
- Homework: What's another way to say that you're cold, something is expensive, someone is old, sick, or someone's beard is messy?

# Paint Better with Metaphors

- Corporate buzzwords are endless opportunities to make fun of cliches, take them literally, or distort their meaning in some absurd way.
  - "Piece of the puzzle", "deep dive", "wrap my brain", "Jill's bucket", "muddies the water", "walking into a minefield".

# Exaggerate More

- Good exaggerations often trigger quick mental visuals of the exaggerated event. If it's not remotely possible, people have difficulty suspending any disbelief. It just makes normal situations more interesting than they really are.
