- Humor is power. Humor helps build connections and relationships in ways that few other social interactions can. It makes all participants feel good, and it brings people together in shared positive expreicnes that are memorable and lasting.
- If you act like things are funny, then it's more likely to be funny and for you to get the reaction you are looking for.

- Literal, serious, and predictable comments are never funny. Tap into your inner child and learn to play more.
  - Instead of "yeah, it's too hot", just say "yeah I feel like I just walked into the Amazon rainforest".
  - Exaggerating things inspires further playful conversation. Funny people are always looking for alternative, playful ways to comment and engage in conversations.
  - Direct questions like "Where are you going" or "What are you doing" are perfect opportunities for experimenting with unanticipated humorous responses. When people expect literal answer, a lighthearted and funny response could result in easy humor because it's unexpected.
  - Rather than describe a situation in literal terms, with the right tone, timing, and body language, you can always say something with a fun, exaggerated twist.
  - *You're not going to make someone laugh every time with every humor technique, but the point is to position the social interaction near or within the play zone so you at least have a chance at creating humor. And that stars with not being literal all the time.*
  - *Humor and fun don't live in the safe and predictable. You have to be okay with a handful of randomness and a pinch of silliness. Robin Williams: "You're only given a little spark of madness, you musn't lose it.*
  - You may not always have fun, but you have to put yourself in a position to have fun. Take things on chances that aren't predictable.

# Laugh at Yourself First

- Most comedians rely on self-deprecating humor-they know their own weaknesses or shortcomings and aren't afraid to point it out in a humorous way. It's easily one of the most common comedic techniques.
- *Likeable and easy-going people are usually comfortable in their own skin and have embraced their character flaws. They are okay with being a little bit vulnerable. Such people are the first to admit they aren't perfect and are happy to laugh at their personal quirks. They're quick to admit funny mistakes or episodes of forgetfulness. They use their flaws to their advantage.*
- Beautiful actors with arrogant personalities don't attract many fans. Being okay with your own flaws helps you let your guard down, and it lets others take their guards down, too. It's a small reminder that nobody's perfect and that we're all in this together, and that's okay.
- Don't take yourself too seriously if you want to be funny. There is value of being able to laugh at yourself, it's a foundational requirement if you want to make others laugh.
- Start with honesty. Be transparent first, and the funny will come. When you take down your facade, you help others loosen up as well. The social tensions melt away, and the playfulness and fun seep into the interaction.
- Recovering from verbal blunders? Recover and make light of it next time.
- When you take advantage of mistakes instead of ignoring them, you're more likely to venture down fun and engaging tangents rather than experiencing awkward moments.

# Don't Be an Energy Vampire

- The success of a joke or story always comes down to how the words are delivered and not just the words themselves. The more playful energy and enthusiasm you put into a social interaction, the more of it you'll see reflected back from the other person.
- Ask yourself, do you more often add energy to a social interaction, or suck it away like an energy vampire? If you're sucking the energy out of situations, or if you're hard to hear or understand, nothing you say will make a difference.
- Visual body language also matters - are you stiff as a board, or are you animated?

# The Humor's in the Details

- People can say the same basic thing but receive a much better reaction cause of - a different timing, emphasis, intonation, energy, personal style. Keywords can make or break a phrase, joke or story.
- Colorful words trigger emotions and mental images. Boring words do not. However, everything you say doesn't need to be colorful or bursting with flavor. The goal is to strike a balance between a few boring words and too many detailed words.
- Absolute language: "No one should ever get a burgundy-colored birthday card." Same with the more visual and inherently fun-sounding keyword "burgundy". Instead of "I'm a chemistry teacher", how about "I basically teach kids how to play with poisons".
- "That swanky bar is where all the rich people go to." "Sure, I can smell the swank from here!"
- Homework: What's another way to say that you're cold, something is expensive, someone is old, sick, or someone's beard is messy?

# Paint Better with Metaphors

- Corporate buzzwords are endless opportunities to make fun of cliches, take them literally, or distort their meaning in some absurd way.
  - "Piece of the puzzle", "deep dive", "wrap my brain", "Jill's bucket", "muddies the water", "walking into a minefield".

# Exaggerate More

- Good exaggerations often trigger quick mental visuals of the exaggerated event. If it's not remotely possible, people have difficulty suspending any disbelief. It just makes normal situations more interesting than they really are.
- Literal or factual comments will never be as visual, emotional, or dramatic as exaggerated comments. Think about what comments you can make about "old", "full", "hungry".
- Describing something in a new or more exaggerated way can serve as a good response. Then, people can build on another person's previous comment. Just use superlatives: the biggest, the best, the longest. Superlatives make everything more dramatic and interesting. "He may have the worst serve in the history of men's tennis."
- Exaggerated idiosyncrasies and quirks are usually very entertaining. Exaggerate the impact something has. Not every exaggerated comment will take off, but they at least open the door to playfulness and create an opportunity for fun and humor.

# React More Like a YouTuber

- People who don't react much to anything are boring. Reacting is not just good for humor, it's also good for engagement. You can't make people laugh without being an active participant in the social situation. Boring people react seriously and soberly to everything. Act a little, for yourself first.
- Knowing how to make interesting observations is the next important technique, and the funniest reaction-video YouTubers are masters at observational humor. They know how to look for and point out the ridiculous or interesting in the mundane, all without necessarily being exceptionally witty or clever. Study how they make observations. Your ability to engage people, maintain a fun conversation, and make people laugh will improve tenfold by engaging and reacting to the ordinary aspects of day-to-day life more dramatically.

# Add Some Flavor to Your Opinion Soup

- When you introduce more subjectivity, you start creating more interesting conversation and moving closer toward humor. Instead of saying, "that's a naked statue", you can add more subjectivity and strength to the observation: "that's an R-rated statue", "I think that once you become a status, you should be allowed to show any body part you want".
- *Save your stronger opinions for trivial topics so you mitigate the chance of offending someone.* All humans are fascinated with superlatives, incorporate more hyperboles, categorical, and absolute statements.
- Playful opinions about other people and the nuances of human behaviour constitute a large area ripe for exploring. "He's supposed to be Elvis? My mom looks more like Elvis than that guy." "I think you may have an addiction to chocolate-covered almonds. I know a good 12-step program if you need help.
- You have to be good at describing things.

# Stick a Label on It

- "You can categorise 90% of my male listeners by one of three summer activities: there's boat guy, there's golf guy, and there's cabin guy."
- Make up new meanings for words or new words entirely:
  - Walking up and down stairs every day for work? "Corporate aerobics."
  - Daughter visiting wildlife in the backyard? "Squirrel whisperer."
  - Holding the door? "Bellhop", "underpaid doorman".
  - Friend making fun of cargo pants? "Pocket envy."
- Develop an eye for noticing subtleties in human behaviour and appearance. Talk about the idiosyncrasies of the human condition. Question why people act the way they do. Point out your own experiences and quirks. If you can, re-enact the behaviour or mannerisms you've observed.
- When labelling, make sure your label is blatantly wrong, or someone may think there's truth to it, and they become confused instead of amused.
- Label yourself: "I feel like a soccer mom...", "I don't want to sound like a get off my lawn guy", "I'm a fancy guy".

# That Looks Like

- Figurative language is usually more entertaining and enjoyable than literal language. Metaphors, similes, and other figurative language is your ticket to more colorful and imaginative commentary.
- "I feel like x right now".

# Imagine the Impact

- Talk about the potential impact some action or comment has on you, someone or something else. How might someone feel, how might someone else react?

# Imagine a Playful Explanation

- "Your son has been so good this whole time" => "Thanks, someone probably gave him a few beers from the fridge!"

# Talk About the Almost

- Talk about what "almost" occurred. The "almost" moments are sometimes more interesting because they open the door to hypothetical possibilities.

# Seek Hypothetical Solutions

- Ex: When losing hair, think about bringing powdered wigs back.

# Hit Them With the Right Hook

- Interesting angle: introduce drama or intrigue into the story and is often what hooks someone in. Interesting angles consider unique perspectives or compelling viewpoints. Tap into the emotional side of the human brain, instead of its analytical side.
- Good journalists are good at transforming dry information into interesting stories. They've mastered the art of engagement and know what gets your attention.
- The skill of making people laugh starts by creating opportunities for laughter. Like how hypothetical statements need a strong observation precursor, many fun comments need to be "set up" before the situation is ripe for comedy.

# Look for Contrasts

- Contrasting statements inherently create interesting angles and hook people in.
- Even things like "Yes, I mean no!" make people smile lol.
- Rule of Three: The first two things create a pattern, the third thing breaks the pattern.
- Ex: "I really loved it", vs "I didn't think it would be any good, but I actually really loved it!"
- Contrasts can be formed by contrasting against the comment before it.
- "I had some great tacos from a food truck down the street, and it wasn't even a fancy one, it was one of those old ones, too!"
- "You went easy on me in there. I thought you were going to crucify me about being late!"
- "I started working out of my house, until I realised that working out of your house will make you go crazy and start talking to the dog all the time!"
- "I hope they `___`, because last time they `___`."
- "I was/wasn't expecting `___`, but `___` occurred."
- "I wasn't sure about `___`, but I think I'm going to `___`."
- "I didn't think I would like `___`, but it turned out to be `___`."

# Look for Disagreements and Exceptions

- "Oh, I'll eat anything, I'm not picky at all, except mushrooms. I don't go near fungus!"
- Strong initial comment often results in a better contrast.
- "Although I spilled soda all over my pants, but other than that, it was a blast!"
- "I love you man, even if you smell like vinegar."
- "I mean, it did look like sewage water, but it still tasted good!"
- "The surest way to failure is to try to please everyone."

# Play with the Premise

- Humor often relies on misdirection. Whenever there is an understood assumption, premise, or expectation, there is an opportunity for a humorous contrast of that assumption, premise, or expectation.
- It's better to save the punchline of any type of joke or funny comment for the end. You want to allow for enough build-up of anticipation to occur.
- "The best tool in my garage is my wallet." is better than "My wallet is the best tool in my garage".
- The more literal, serious, and predictable you are; the more likely you're not saying anything funny. It also has to not be nonsensical.
- Applying the Technique:
  - Consider the underlying premise/subtext of the situation.
  - Consider what someone probably expects to happen next.
  - Instead of saying/doing what is expected, move along the premise and reversing the initial expectation.

# Make It Trivially Significant

- Treating a significant situation as trivial, or a trivial situation as significant is an easy-to-cook recipe for humor. In either case, the premise is being played with to create a contrast.

# Observational Humor

- Zooming in on the mundane, finding the commonality we all experience, and finding the absurd aspects of it. If you find something strange or nonsensical, it's likely others will too if you describe it accurately. Share more of the quirky subtleties of your life experiences and observations of everyday things.
- Look for an insignificant thing that could take on a larger role, exaggerate its characteristics, question why it exists, and provide supporting examples to prove your point if applicable.
- A lot of humor relies on pretending to sweat the small stuff.
- "This laptop is burning me. I think the top of my pants are melting. I can smell the slight burning of my thigh skin."
- Self-observations are the safest kind because it's difficult to offend anyone if you're targeting yourself, which leaves the door wide open for extreme exaggerations and embellishments. Talk about yourself and your silly quirks more. Share more funny stories about your life.
  - "I'm always late to `___`. I end up pissing everyone off because I `___`."
  - "I never eat `___`. It grosses me out that they `___`."
  - "I'm kind of obsessed with `___`. Don't tell anyone, if anyone found out, I'd `___`."
- Pay more attention to what you find interesting in the world. Look for patterns or strange coincidences. Analyze those moments where you stop and say, "Huh, that's interesting." Expand on it, why is it interesting?

# Sneak in Some Sarcasm

- Make funnier comments with understatements or overstatements.
- When presented with any situation: you can either overstate, state the facts exactly, or understate.
- Sarcasm is not too hard to get right, it's not too risky, and it sometimes makes people smile or laugh.

# Add Hypothetical Statements to Your Opinions

- "I love reading. I'd live in the basement of a bookstore if they'd let me."
- "It costs 50K? That's expensive. That's a down payment on a house!"
- "That's risky, I'm not doing that. You'd have to buy me lunch at Panera every single day for three months straight."
- "It has 50 grams of sugar? You might as well be drinking a glass of corn syrup!"
- "That's a lot of signs" => "I don't know if they have enough signs." Exaggerate the absurdities of everyday life. If you look for absurdities, you'll find them.
- You can call out someone's pattern of behaviour with a beautiful and hilarious hypothetical metaphor:
  - Conan: "Corralling you is, wow, very difficult. You’re like a kitten at a rave, you’re just all over the map. You’re distracted by colors… you’re spinning… you’re pawing at the air. People are picking you up, you get loose, and you run around again. I am trying to get a cogent interview and it’s impossible."
  - "You’re always so laid back and chill. You’re a guy who shows up, and you’ve got your Panama hat and your boardshorts. And you’re wearing your saratchos… clubatos… I’m making up words now."
- You can also make up some fun secret motivations. "You're secretly a ..."
- Secret intentions: attribute human traits to animals or objects.
