# The Comic Toolbox: How to be Funny Even If You're Not

# Introduction

- The mere act of doing the unexpected thing created one funny moment after another.
- Stop trying to ask yourself how you can make your creative process fresh and new. Break old habits, even the ones that work. Write in bed, paint in the park, draw cartoons on walls, the more you do this, the funnier you'll be. If nothing else, you'll have the experiences of doing something new, and the new thing is almost always worth doing, if for nothing but the newness alone.

# Comedy is Truth and Pain

- Leslie Parker: Comedy is truth and pain. The truth of love and the pain of love lost.
- Traveling salesman: truth that they want the sale, pain that they won't get it. Same with dirty/sex jokes.
- Relations between the sexes are problematic.
- Truth: all men, sometimes, are henpecked, and the pain is that some men are stuck with it.
- Truth: Death, like sex, is fundamental to the human experience.
- Religion: We want to believe, we're just not sure we do. Truth: some people strive for faith. Pain: Not everybody gets there. ***When people don't get a joke, or they take offense at it, they feel that way because they don't accept the "truth" that the joke presents.***
- What makes a thing funny is how it impacts the generally held beliefs of the audience hearing the joke.
- ***The trick is to make sure that your audience has the same points of reference as you.***
- Any human experience, no matter how large or small, can be made to be funny if its truth and its pain are readily identifiable to the target audience.
- Class clown: tells jokes everyone gets, class nerd: tells a joke that only he gets. Comedy is not just truth and pain, but universal truth and pain.

# The Will to Risk

- If people aren't funny, then there are usually two things lacking:
  - Understanding what's funny and what's not
  - The will to risk
- False assumptions: "this joke won't work, they won't like it".
- Faulty association: "we have a great deal to lose if this joke's not funny".
- ***People aren't thinking how you look to them. They're far too busy worrying how they look to you.***
- Faulty association: "when they don't like me, I can't like myself".
- For every ten jokes you tell, nine will be trash. For every ten ideas you have, nine won't work. This just means that at some point you lose the toxic expectation of succeeding every time.
- Ex: Think of ten funny sports names
- Concentrate only on the task at hand: writing the word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, chapter.
- ***Applaud every small victory, because every time you do, you create an environment in which a larger victory can grow.***
- What's important with thinking up of "10 example of funny blah blah" is you finish the exercise. You did the job.
- The better you imagine yourself to be, the better you become. Concentrate on the process, not the product. By attending to the ongoing performance instead of the applause at the curtain to come, you change the game from one you can never win to one you must always win.
- Go back to the things you can control: words on the page, cartoons in the sketch pad, whatever.
- ***After finding some darned thing to feel good about, you improve your self-image, reduce your anxiety, focus your concentration, and raise the level of your confidence.***

### The Comic Premise

- This is the gap between comic reality and real reality.
- Once you recognize the gap of the comic premise, you'll start to see it in every funny situation, then you'll begin to reverse the process, not just seeing it in experienced situations, but investing it in comic situations of your own construction.
- "What's funny?" The structured mind focuses on this thing called the comic premise and tries to get led by some magic hand to some creative end.
- ***The more we structure the task, the more we convert the act of creation to the act of asking and answering simple questions, the easier the whole thing gets.***
- Within the comic premise, there's not just one gap between real and comic reality, but all sorts of different gaps. They all turn on conflict, and the deeper the conflict gets, the more interesting the premise becomes.
  - Classic dramatic structure: man vs nature, man vs man, man vs self.
  - Global conflict: the conflict between that of a normal character in a comic world, or a comic character in a normal world.
  - It's sometimes about an individual against a whole social structure.
