- *Strong eye contact.*
  - Gaze, not stare. Stare = news anchor reading a teleprompter. Gaze = how your eyes might look when you see three puppies playing and fighting over a stuffed cow.
  - Move your eyes around, but on their face.
  - Exercise: With sunglasses on, look at people in the eye in the park.
- *Prepare yourself mentally and physically.*
  - Listen to hype music or awesome speeches.
  - Technique: Read things out loud.
- *React with Importance.*
  - When a joke isn't funny, at least acknowledge it, right?
  - The absence of a reaction causes a disconnect between two people.
  - Technique: Pick out the primary emotion, and try to predict the reaction they are seeking from you.
- *Don't answer literally.*
  - They probably don't care about your weekend, they just want to hear something interesting from you, and most of the time, answering questions literally will provide the opposite of that.
- *Curiouser than the dead cat.*
  - Being curious about someone can put you far above the fold.
  - Ask many questions and go deeper into a topic. You'd essentially be a question master, and that makes you favorable. People love talking about themselves.
- *The king of stories.*
  - Prepare funny stories that can answer this question.
- *Keep the flow.*
  - If people are affected on an emotional level, they share topics or whatever.
  - Stay on the message that other people want and show them you feel it too. Take a step back and think about the purpose that someone is telling you.
