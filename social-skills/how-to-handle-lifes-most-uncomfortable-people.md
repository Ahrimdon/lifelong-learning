- *People Who Don't Know What to Say.*
  - Ask a simple question that requires an opinion: "what do you think about..."
  - Show them you're okay with their discomfort. "Did I say something that put you off?" Put the awkward situation out in the open so there's no more trying to hide it, and you take the blame for it so they won't need to assume responsibility or can assure you that they're just shy or nervous.
  - Don't be boring on purpose--your goal should be an interesting conversation, because then you walk away from the interaction with something, no matter what.
- *People Who Share Too Much Information.*
  - Be honest. "I'm really not comfortable talking about this."
  - "We've been talking for awhile and I really want to see some other people here."
  - Be a mirror. Start oversharing yourself.
- *People Who Inspire Uncomfortable Conversations.*
  - Don't assume that they are aware of the problem.
  - Don't assume that they will agree that what they're doing is a problem.
  - "You may not be aware, but your behavior is making me uncomfortable. You're entitled to your own personal choices, but perhaps we can come up with a compromise that suits us both."
