# Networking for founders
[Reference](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/networking)

- It's just talking to someone who could potentially help you in business.
- You should seek to understand people/relationships better so you don't miss out on a good relationship, a chance to help someone, or a chance to get help yourself. It's about being aware of how you come off to others. It's about building community.
- If we want to build a tech business, to look for customers, we can:
  - Events: either online or in person. Conferences, local professional events.
  - Social media.
  - Online communities.
  - Interviews.
  - Mentoring, volunteering.
- If you seek to create value for others, others will create value for you. Nothing is more powerful than seeing reciprocity in action.
- Ex: running large charitable initiatives to help others, mentoring people one-on-one, organized a mentoring program, and taught free classes in the community.
- It's not just the actual helping, but the building a reputation behind it.
- Balancing my time between helping others and being helped, and helping others without expecting anything in return, feels good for the soul, and makes you a better human being in your interactions with the people who can help you.

## First Impression

- Dress/appearance. Your performance of you is a compression of everything you are and have experienced. Your physical presentation is a compression about the compression.
- Taking control of your first impression is not bowing down to the expectations of others, it's accepting the reality of the world, being knowledgeable about it, and being deliberate in how you want to come off to others.
- Stylists help. For clothing, fit is the most important thing.
- If possible, get styled by a professional.

## Website

- The general design of your website should communicate professionalism.
- Make it obvious and explicit how a first-time visitor engages with you. What's your process? Can they do a free evaluation of your product? How can they contact you?
- Remove barriers to getting to talk to you!
- Amplify the credentials of your team.

## Social Media

- **Ensure your recent posts generally include something about your industry or business.** My pinned tweet is always about my business. When I first started, I'd make sure at least 50% of my posts were about my product, work, or industry.
- Your professional presence on social media is equivalent to you speaking to others in-person at a tech meetup.
- Present your business as overall stable and doing well.
- Be authentic.
- Code repositories: Consider having a designed website for the project, Github's branding makes people

## Creating helpful and meaningful content

- Speaking at local events.
  - You can browse social media and ask people you know in the industry for recommendations. Sometimes, intimate local events can be nicer than speaking at a conference because there's much less pressure.
- Speaking at conferences. Conferences are great for building credibility and are especially useful for building credibility with developers if you sell to engineers.
- Blogging.
- Mailing list.
- Podcasts, online conferences, online events.
- Online communities.

## Direct asks

- Chatting only about learning. You can ask experienced business people out to coffee. They're an excellent way to learn business, coding, any topic. The Internet has lots of resources to learn from, but having someone that can give you customized advice and curated learning resources is invaluable.
- Be open to questions and let people take you out for an informational interview!
