- Don't use too many hard words. People know if you are trying to sound smart.
- Lose the "this might be dumb, but" disclaimer.
- Turn "yes, but" into "yes, and ...".
- Don't be a bulldozer, be a knocker. Re: ideas.
- Follow up. Most people are so busy. Go on and move things ahead.
  - "I'm following up on the proposal that I sent you last week on a strategy for our social media content. In case you missed it, I'm attaching it again and I'd be happy to walk you through it. I know it's been an ongoing challenge for us and I really think this could solve it. I'd love to see if you agree. If there's a better time to follow up, let me know and I'll circle back then."

- Human beings just have this.
- *Adore your detours.* Trust that you made the best choices you had at the time that you made them.
- *Go cold turkey on comparing yourselves with others.* This is where this "I should be ahead by now" BS comes from. Put your blinders on. You need to focus on your own game.
- Do a total social media detox and stop looking at people who you tend to compare to. *Do not actively search for things that will make you upset.*

"Trust the timing of your life."
