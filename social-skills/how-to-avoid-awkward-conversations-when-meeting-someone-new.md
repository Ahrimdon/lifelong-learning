## How to Avoid Awkward Conversations when Meeting Someone New
[Reference](http://lifehacker.com/5948534/how-to-avoid-awkward-conversations-when-meeting-someone-new)

- *Comment on a topic common to both of you at the moment.* "How do you know our host?" "What brings you to this event?" Unless you can be hilariously funny, it usually isn't a good idea to complain.
- *Comment on a topic of general interest.* Scanning news articles first before going anywhere to make small talk.
- *Ask open questions that can't be answered with a single word.* "What do you do?", "What are you working on these days?"
- *Ask getting-to-know-you questions.* "What newspapers and magazines do you subscribe to?" "What Internet sites do you visit regularly?"
- *React to what a person says in the spirit in which that that comment was offered.* If it seems like they were joking, laugh. If it seems like they were saying surprising information, react with surprise.

### Comments

- Regarding "I only want to discuss non-small talk things":
  - It's not all about you. People want to connect to other people. They want to be acknowledged. When you give another person a little of their time, you're really telling them that they matter, that they're worth something in this world. That you care about them as a human being.
  - Conversations do start better if you can start with something topical or immediately relevant, but sometimes the only thing you have to start on is the weather - everyone experiences the weather.
  - You know who I like having conversations with? Older, experienced people. They drop most of that societal pretense of formality and get right into the meat of the conversation.
  - I find it interesting that several of you have called this "teenage" behavior, considering that the first people I think of who say that they don't care about other people's business are the elderly or the quietly confident. Teenagers are different. They are **self interested**, but they most certainly care about the thoughts of other people. Teenagers think their way is the right way, and that they are always right. I may be wrong. My philosophies may be totally amiss. But I still don't care how the tomatoes in your garden are doing. Look, all I did was admit that I don't care about that stuff. I really don't. (For the record, I'm nowhere near a teenager, and I've been quite productive and successful in lifeâ€”I just don't care that your daughter plays flute in the middle school band.)
