## The Science of Likeability: 27 Studies to Master Charisma, Attract Friends, and Captivate People

- Psychology: Studying of why people do the things they do. Ex: discovering what works in advertisements and why, how to use reverse psychology, and why we get lazier when we're surrounded by more people.
- Little Albert: Associating a rat (which he had never seen before) with noise. He becomes afraid of the rat by itself.

### How to Improve People Moods

- Why do some people instantly like us, while others never come around?
- *When people subconsciously begin to associate you with positive moods and emotions, you are going to be the bell that makes people smile without realizing why.*
- Memories are heavily linked to the context, environment, events, and moods that were present at the time of the memory. This means memory is not a flat representation of a set of events--it's a holistic snapshot of everything that was happening at that exact moment in time.
- *Our current moods are highly linked to the type of memories that are on your mind.*
- To improve Dorothy's mood: indirectly display things that remind her of that day. You might even bring up a wedding you were at recently, since she has a fond memory of weddings.
- Charismatic and likable people are partially so because they make the people around them feel good and energized.
- We're not always able to tell if someone is truly happy or sad, because people are often socialized to not wear their hearts on their sleeves.
- Easiest way to tell: "How are you doing?"
- We tend to gravitate toward people who make us feel good, and away from things that hurt us. We also gravitate toward people and things associated with the people who make us feel good, and this is called classical conditioning.
- *People enjoy being happy, so they will naturally want to be around the causes of their happiness.*
- *You'll be surprised by how effective staying in a good mood, putting on a happy face, praising others, and complimenting others can be.*
- In our modern world, there are a lot of unpleasant people, and most people are too absorbed in their own muck to be cheerful to others.
- One easy way is to bring food to any gathering you attend. People will begin to welcome your presence regardless of the occasion, and they won't even realize that it may be because of the food instead of your shining personality.
- Pay attention especially to compliments you can pay in recognizing something that someone has put effort into. This shows an extra layer of though and care.
- Associating with things: if someone loves skiing, you can talk about, ask, show them pictures, etc. of the thing. Improving people's moods is about more than the mood itself.

### How To Turn Enemies into Friends

- Friends of convenience: the people who inhabit your high school reunions.
- Enemy: always means to do you harm.
- Benjamin Franklin ask for a favor thing.
- You force people to confront and justify their actions to themselves Why would a person do an enemy a favor? Deep down, they feel some type of affection, respect, or interest.

### How to Create the Foundation of Friendship

- Are your friendships and relationships purely transactional?
- In reality, people subconsciously evaluate their relationships based on how much value they get from such relationships.
- Value can be emotional terms.
- Transactions are only good if they are relatively equal.
- When you externally acknowledge equity theory and make it known you are fighting your human tendency to take as much as possibly, people will take notice.
- People do not like to be in somebody else's debt. People do not like to feel that their friend is giving them more than they give their friend.
- If you see situations where you benefit more, call them out publicly and make sure to rectify them as soon as possible.
- *Equality and equity is one of the first foundations of friendship. The second foundation to friendship is similarity.*
- Similarity: Trying to figure out what things we are similar to someone else with. Turns out that we are more drawn and attracted to people who show greater degrees of similarity to us.
- Some weird assumptions you make from people who are similar to you: sharing the same values, similar worldview, "they get you", similar personality, make inside jokes, you know them as a person.
- This means we should always be searching for similarities or creating them. Special circumstances etc.
- Mirroring: mimicking someone else's body language, voice tonality, figure of speech.

### How to Act the Part

- By acting the part of a familiar friend, you become more likable.
- We have general snapshots of people. Within these snapshots, feelings, habits, emotions, and interplay are included.
- Speak to people the way you speak to your best friends. Talk about intimate matters. Joke with them and act familiar. Be there for them emotionally and support them through whatever they are going through.
- Faking like you are friends. That's not manipulation, you're just skipping past small talk and diving into the interesting parts of people's lives.
- Acting the part of a good friend is helpful.
- Pygmalion Effect: if you have an image of that person's behavior and personality, that's exactly who they'll become.
- Teachers subconsciously or consciously treat "smart" (just told) kids that they were better.
- *A key to likability is to have positive perceptions of people so they can become who we think they are.*
- If you were told someone was charming and fascinating, you would dig deeper into their background and discover what might be interesting about them.
- Assume the best of the people you're speaking with and you will start treating them in a way that makes them like you more.

### How to Persuade and Negotiate Effectively

- Each party just wants to feel like they got a good deal and a win.
- Figure out what they value, or to reframe your proposition to them in a way that makes them feel like they got a good deal.
- "Door in the Face": Ask for a borderline unreasonable amount. Then back off and ask for an amount that is closer to your actual goal. Second figure will seem far more reasonable than the first figure. It's a "win" for them.
- "Foot in the Door": Small favors or concessions, and gradually work up to your desired ask. Your goal with that figure is to gain agreement and goodwill with the other person.

### How to Gain Trust and Credibility

- Neighbors on the same floor tended to be friends and people who lived near the mailboxes and staircases were friends with people on different floors.
- Friendship/trust increase linearly with simple interaction and exposure. The more we see someone, the more likely we will become friends with them and come to trust them.
- Typical sales cycle: Make sure you have many point of contact with them. So this makes you trust them more if they are present in your life.
- Trust: Simply show up.
- Credibility
  - Highlight past experience and your qualifications.
  - Display how much you care.
  - Similarity: dress, body language, speaking style.
  - Appear assertive. People can trust your judgments because you know the other side of the argument and can convincingly make those arguments go away.
  - Social proof: this is why it's good to have an introduction.
- Bad for credibility
  - Don't contradict yourself. When in doubt, leave it out.
  - Avoid being overly polite.

### How to Work Well With Others

- Stimulus-value-role theory.
  - *Stimulus stage.* Evaluating people based on their physical attributes and superficial traits. We seek people who are attractive, but also of a similar age, appearance, and perception of status. This is why 90-year olds who are friends with 20-year olds look weird.
  - *Value stage.* Finding people that share our thoughts and morals.
  - *Role stage.* How people will complement us in working toward a shared goal. The deepest friendships function in a sense like business relationships--there has to be ultimate compatibility and a sense of benefit for each party.
- People filter their contacts on a subconscious level--simply by being aware that this subconscious filtering process is taking place, you can put yourself in a better position. Ex: look the part in that you also wear the same jersey.
- Next: present that you have the same morals and values as him, regardless of your background or pedigree.
- Once you have shown that you look and act the part, you want to show that you share similar activities, and you can work together, without any hint of conflict.
- If you can travel together, then you have shown compatibility and chemistry on a far deeper level.
- Role stage: you can function and actually work well together. *Why business gets done on the golf course and or bar napkins--people are able to decide that they can work with each other's reciprocal abilities, and move into each other's inner circle.*
- Females: Are less competitive and more collaborative in nature.
- Males: Are more competitive and their self-image doesn't take a hit when they're put in a competitive environment.
- *Avoid competition and comparison in social settings, unless you know the outcome will make the other person feel better about themselves.*
- When you are working together, focus on the shared goal at hand and not individual contributions. Everything is equal in pursuit of the goal.
- Remember that the overarching goal of any interaction, whether social or work-related, is not to look good by crushing another person. Your overarching goal should be to build rapport and comfort, and in this chapter, specifically to showcase the trai
