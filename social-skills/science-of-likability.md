## The Science of Likeability: 27 Studies to Master Charisma, Attract Friends, and Captivate People

- Psychology: Studying of why people do the things they do. Ex: discovering what works in advertisements and why, how to use reverse psychology, and why we get lazier when we're surrounded by more people.
- Little Albert: Associating a rat (which he had never seen before) with noise. He becomes afraid of the rat by itself.

### How to Improve People Moods

- Why do some people instantly like us, while others never come around?
- *When people subconsciously begin to associate you with positive moods and emotions, you are going to be the bell that makes people smile without realizing why.*
- Memories are heavily linked to the context, environment, events, and moods that were present at the time of the memory. This means memory is not a flat representation of a set of events--it's a holistic snapshot of everything that was happening at that exact moment in time.
- *Our current moods are highly linked to the type of memories that are on your mind.*
- To improve Dorothy's mood: indirectly display things that remind her of that day. You might even bring up a wedding you were at recently, since she has a fond memory of weddings.
- Charismatic and likable people are partially so because they make the people around them feel good and energized.
- We're not always able to tell if someone is truly happy or sad, because people are often socialized to not wear their hearts on their sleeves.
- Easiest way to tell: "How are you doing?"
- We tend to gravitate toward people who make us feel good, and away from things that hurt us. We also gravitate toward people and things associated with the people who make us feel good, and this is called classical conditioning.
- *People enjoy being happy, so they will naturally want to be around the causes of their happiness.*
- *You'll be surprised by how effective staying in a good mood, putting on a happy face, praising others, and complimenting others can be.*
- In our modern world, there are a lot of unpleasant people, and most people are too absorbed in their own muck to be cheerful to others.
- One easy way is to bring food to any gathering you attend. People will begin to welcome your presence regardless of the occasion, and they won't even realize that it may be because of the food instead of your shining personality.
- Pay attention especially to compliments you can pay in recognizing something that someone has put effort into. This shows an extra layer of though and care.
- Associating with things: if someone loves skiing, you can talk about, ask, show them pictures, etc. of the thing. Improving people's moods is about more than the mood itself.

### How To Turn Enemies into Friends

- Friends of convenience: the people who inhabit your high school reunions.
- Enemy: always means to do you harm.
- Benjamin Franklin ask for a favor thing.
- You force people to confront and justify their actions to themselves Why would a person do an enemy a favor? Deep down, they feel some type of affection, respect, or interest.

### How to Create the Foundation of Friendship

- Are your friendships and relationships purely transactional?
- In reality, people subconsciously evaluate their relationships based on how much value they get from such relationships.
- Value can be emotional terms.
- Transactions are only good if they are relatively equal.
- When you externally acknowledge equity theory and make it known you are fighting your human tendency to take as much as possibly, people will take notice.
- People do not like to be in somebody else's debt. People do not like to feel that their friend is giving them more than they give their friend.
- If you see situations where you benefit more, call them out publicly and make sure to rectify them as soon as possible.
- *Equality and equity is one of the first foundations of friendship. The second foundation to friendship is similarity.*
- Similarity: Trying to figure out what things we are similar to someone else with. Turns out that we are more drawn and attracted to people who show greater degrees of similarity to us.
- Some weird assumptions you make from people who are similar to you: sharing the same values, similar worldview, "they get you", similar personality, make inside jokes, you know them as a person.
- This means we should always be searching for similarities or creating them. Special circumstances etc.
- Mirroring: mimicking someone else's body language, voice tonality, figure of speech.

### How to Act the Part

- By acting the part of a familiar friend, you become more likable.
- We have general snapshots of people. Within these snapshots, feelings, habits, emotions, and interplay are included.
- Speak to people the way you speak to your best friends. Talk about intimate matters. Joke with them and act familiar. Be there for them emotionally and support them through whatever they are going through.
- Faking like you are friends. That's not manipulation, you're just skipping past small talk and diving into the interesting parts of people's lives.
- Acting the part of a good friend is helpful.
- Pygmalion Effect: if you have an image of that person's behavior and personality, that's exactly who they'll become.
- Teachers subconsciously or consciously treat "smart" (just told) kids that they were better.
- *A key to likability is to have positive perceptions of people so they can become who we think they are.*
- If you were told someone was charming and fascinating, you would dig deeper into their background and discover what might be interesting about them.
- Assume the best of the people you're speaking with and you will start treating them in a way that makes them like you more.

### How to Persuade and Negotiate Effectively

- Each party just wants to feel like they got a good deal and a win.
- Figure out what they value, or to reframe your proposition to them in a way that makes them feel like they got a good deal.
- "Door in the Face": Ask for a borderline unreasonable amount. Then back off and ask for an amount that is closer to your actual goal. Second figure will seem far more reasonable than the first figure. It's a "win" for them.
- "Foot in the Door": Small favors or concessions, and gradually work up to your desired ask. Your goal with that figure is to gain agreement and goodwill with the other person.

### How to Gain Trust and Credibility

- Neighbors on the same floor tended to be friends and people who lived near the mailboxes and staircases were friends with people on different floors.
- Friendship/trust increase linearly with simple interaction and exposure. The more we see someone, the more likely we will become friends with them and come to trust them.
- Typical sales cycle: Make sure you have many point of contact with them. So this makes you trust them more if they are present in your life.
- Trust: Simply show up.
- Credibility
  - Highlight past experience and your qualifications.
  - Display how much you care.
  - Similarity: dress, body language, speaking style.
  - Appear assertive. People can trust your judgments because you know the other side of the argument and can convincingly make those arguments go away.
  - Social proof: this is why it's good to have an introduction.
- Bad for credibility
  - Don't contradict yourself. When in doubt, leave it out.
  - Avoid being overly polite.

### How to Work Well With Others

- Stimulus-value-role theory.
  - *Stimulus stage.* Evaluating people based on their physical attributes and superficial traits. We seek people who are attractive, but also of a similar age, appearance, and perception of status. This is why 90-year olds who are friends with 20-year olds look weird.
  - *Value stage.* Finding people that share our thoughts and morals.
  - *Role stage.* How people will complement us in working toward a shared goal. The deepest friendships function in a sense like business relationships--there has to be ultimate compatibility and a sense of benefit for each party.
- People filter their contacts on a subconscious level--simply by being aware that this subconscious filtering process is taking place, you can put yourself in a better position. Ex: look the part in that you also wear the same jersey.
- Next: present that you have the same morals and values as him, regardless of your background or pedigree.
- Once you have shown that you look and act the part, you want to show that you share similar activities, and you can work together, without any hint of conflict.
- If you can travel together, then you have shown compatibility and chemistry on a far deeper level.
- Role stage: you can function and actually work well together. *Why business gets done on the golf course and or bar napkins--people are able to decide that they can work with each other's reciprocal abilities, and move into each other's inner circle.*
- Females: Are less competitive and more collaborative in nature.
- Males: Are more competitive and their self-image doesn't take a hit when they're put in a competitive environment.
- *Avoid competition and comparison in social settings, unless you know the outcome will make the other person feel better about themselves.*
- When you are working together, focus on the shared goal at hand and not individual contributions. Everything is equal in pursuit of the goal.
- Remember that the overarching goal of any interaction, whether social or work-related, is not to look good by crushing another person. Your overarching goal should be to build rapport and comfort, and in this chapter, specifically to showcase the traits and value that will move you through people's friendship stages.

### How to be More Endearing

- Perfect people scare and intimidate us. We're uncomfortable around them, and they make us self-conscious in ways we never thought possible.
- Batman and Spiderman are more popular than Superman because Superman is literally a super man. Batman/Spiderman are powerful, yet deeply vulnerable characters. They also have their internal struggles.
- They are extremely humanizing characters and are much more relatable to us than Superman. People are moved to feel for Spiderman and Batman because they can point to their own internal battles and how they've overcome them.
- *Not being perfect is endearing to people.* Vulnerability is attractive, relatable, and also ensure that you aren't intimidating to others. Don't pretend you're perfect.
- *The Pratfall Effect: flaws, hiccups, and imperfections which showed people to be vulnerable made people likable.* You are making others comfortable and easing their fear of judgment. This is why we are uncomfortable around perfection--because we feel we will be judged and inevitably come up short.
- If we are around someone charismatic, we might not want to say anything out of fear. If we are around someone amazingly beautiful, we might hide our faces as not to be compared to them. If we're around someone shockingly intelligent, we might not want to voice our opinions for fear of being found wrong and humiliated.
- The substitute teacher that curses--the class will relax because they felt like they had to be on their best behavior, and now they know their substitute teacher is actually going to be lenient and relaxed.
- If you have a quirk or eccentricity, it is probably the reason why a lot of your friends are drawn to you. Your value to your friends definitely doesn't come from a place of perfection. They like you because of your imperfections and what makes you uniquely you. In fact, you probably have imperfections or quirks in common, and that's what drew you to each other in the first place.
- *The Losada Ratio: The ratio of how much positive feedback is required to lessen the sting of negative feedback.* 5-6 positive statements to 1 critical feedback.
- People are more sensitive than they present themselves to be, and you can choose to acknowledge this or not. Just err on the side of positive and good natured will do you good.
- Participants asking their partner for advice rated the partner higher on competence.
- Ask people about their expertise.

### How to Convince People to Act

- *Reactance theory: if we are told we can't do anything, we immediately want to do it, not because of the action itself, but because we feel psychological discomfort with being told we can't do something, and we seek to prove to ourselves that we indeed can.*
- Ex: Putting a sign saying "do not write stuff on the walls" makes people want to put more graffiti on that sign.
- People hate being told to do something.

### How to Lead Anyone

- There is always only one head of state for every country in the world.
- Sometimes we just want to be told what to do. Sometimes we have surprising clarity about what we know and don't know and rely upon others to provide guidance and direction.
- Every friend group has an unofficial leader.

#### Six Types of Leaders

- *Visionary.* Come with me to a better world.
- *Coaching.* Try this, you might learn from it.
- *Affiliate.* Only if everyone feels good about it.
- *Democratic.* What does everyone think?
- *Pace-setting.* Do more faster.
- *Commanding.* Do what I say.

- *Visionary:*
  - They speak to people's desire to be part of something bigger than themselves. Shared vision--more abstract and motivational in setting priorities.
  - Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. Visualizing a world free from discrimination.
  - This works best for people who are looking to fill a gap or a void.
  - This person is looking for direction and would be open minded to ideas and directions you have.
- *Coaching leader:*
  - Focused on individuals instead of an overarching vision or goal.
  - Coaches are focused on improving the skills of each individual player so they can contribute to the team's success.
  - This might seem like micromanaging.
  - Do this if dealing with people who are a long way off from reaching their full capabilities.
- *Affiliate leader.*
  - They emphasize interpersonal relationships and emotional needs.
  - Emotional buy-in and investment above all else.
- *Democratic leader.*
  - Seeks to build consensus.
  - Best if highly organized and adept at gathering information.
- *Pace-Setting leader.*
  - Leader shows high amount of ambition and makes everyone else adapt to their high standards.
  - Light on guidance, high on metrics and deliverables.
  - Bad usage shows a lack of emotional intelligence and compassion.
  - Best if people are already competent and motivated. They are capable, and just need a push to take them to the next level.
- *Commanding leader.*
  - Expect to be listened to, commands and orders. They motivate people through fear or intimidation.
  - This is why the military is so intentional in breaking the recruits down, so they can command absolute compliance and get them to do things like march into gunfire.
  - Last resort, in the long term, this will wear on anyone.

### How to Avoid Being Judged

- The less knowledge we have about someone, the more we judge them because we have the tendency to fill in the blanks with information largely drawn from stereotypes.
- Ex: If you hear about someone that plays tennis and belongs to a country club, what other pieces of information fit into a view of that person? You probably assumed they were rich, went to a fancy private school, and haven't had to work very hard in their life.
- When we have little information, a mental image forms regardless, and the brain doesn't know the difference between a stereotype and accurate knowledge.
- *Simply providing details about the subject completely unrelated to the stereotype in mind diluted the stereotype and made people more likely to trust and like others.* The more detail about the person, the better, even if it was just completely random.
- People become less suspicious of you and are more willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. By sharing seemingly trivial information about yourself, you allow people to feel like they know you and they stop making assumptions.
- With more information, people suddenly become three-dimensional and not the static character biographies we see in movies. We are humanized, and we eventually realize that all humans are complex amalgamations.
- Oversharing to maximize likability is to get people to feel that they know different sides to you. Give four distinct details when answering easy questions, in this way, you will get into the habit of giving people more information, which will make conversation flow better anyway.
- Let's face it, stereotypes surround us and we judge people every day. It is a survival instinct.
- Don't expect people to share vulnerabilities with you first. You have to make it happen by taking the first step. Most people will reciprocate because you struck a nerve with them.

### How to Win Groups Over

- Social Impact Theory: Group dynamics and winning a group over are largely a function of three factors:
  - Number of people you want to win over.
  - How close physically you are to the group. This is why salespeople always insist on selling in person and setting up appointments, rather than conducting business over the phone. Same with using a phone over email.
  - How important you are to the group in general. You have to be perceived as credible, liked, and known to the group.
- You can split up the people one at a time. Most groups tend to unofficially designate one particular member as the leader.
- Whenever a group tries to decide where to go to dinner, there is always someone who speaks up first, and who others look to for approval and to make the final decision.
- Even if someone has a PhD in an entirely unrelated subject, it will still give you a small amount of credibility.
- Playing on the group's emotions and utilizing emotional debt.
- This can also work backwards--you will be more easily influenced by a group.
  - The greatest overall task is to subvert groupthink (the tendency of groups to conform in thought.)

#### Factors Found in Groupthink

- Illusion of invulnerability: "Together we can't all be wrong."
- Collective rationalization: "This all looks correct, right? No one is saying anything negative about it. If so many of us agree, we must be right."
- Belief in inherent morality: "We are all correct, and everyone else is wrong. Therefore, we have carte blanche to act in our moral superiority.
- Stereotyped views of people outside the group: "They have no idea what they're talking about, and they are all stupid anyway. Let's stick together."
- Direct pressure on dissenters: "Don't you bring up your negative arguments. People are going to get mad at you if you tell them!"
- Self-censorship: I'll just keep this to myself. I don't want to upset people or get on people's bad sides.
- Illusion of unanimity: I think everyone in the group, 100% of us, think this right? Right.
- Self-appointed mindguards: Avoid the newspapers, they are out of context and are borderline lies. Only we know what we are doing.

### How to be Funny and Charismatic

- Charisma isn't related to accuracy, or even the appearance of intelligence. What mattered most was how quickly the participants answered, the speed with which they took action.
- *People tend to have a more favorable impression of you depending on how quickly you speak or take a position. It doesn't matter whether you are correct in your position.* Speed is associated with intelligence and social acumen.
- So to appear more charismatic, it's clearly better to peak first and loudly, even if you have nothing to say, and even if you are speaking gibberish.
- *Speak first and speak quickly. You can always correct what you said. When talking to people, make it your priority to respond in any way possible.*
- IF you meet somebody at a party and they're talking about a problem they have at work, they don't expect you to actually solve their problem, they put it out there for the sake of conversation.
- A quick anything is better than a slow monologue (just like in television shows and movies.)
- Humans are emotional beings, and speed and confidence of presentation are always going to elicit a stronger emotional response than a well-thought-out answer.
- Free association--open any book and blindly put your finger on a page. What word did your finger point to? Now, think of five words, things, people, places, concepts, or thoughts the word makes you think of.

#### Violations Are Funny

- Humor is mostly seen as subjective (seen as true since it does not tend to translate across cultural lines.)
- *There are no comedy movies that have consistently struck gold in international box offices because humor is rooted in language and contextual norms.* This is also why action and adventure movies break box office records, because there's no cultural translation required for an explosion or flying car.
- Benign moral violation--farting in public, spilling a drink over your supervisor. More immoral, the funnier, but too immoral, and it becomes unfunny. The act needs to be immoral, but in a way that appears harmless and has no negative repercussions.
- Ex: Someone falling over and their pants fall down, a ball hitting someone in the crotch, making a gaffe when meeting someone famous or important.
- What makes a violation funny is people are openly talking about something they have been trained not to--just a little bit over the line while not completely obliterating it. The tricky part is to know how far you can push the envelope.
- A too benign moral violation: it will be run of the mill and boring.
- The schadenfreude that we hear is only mean-spirited if we laugh when someone is truly hurt, but to laugh when someone has been violated in a benign way is very natural and widespread.
- The underlying point is it's not negative to talk about negative things. You can bring up negative topics without turning the conversation sour.

### How to Chit-Chat Effectively

- Negative gossip is unavoidable to a degree.
- Social grooming increases the amount of stability and group cohesion in any given group.
- Alpha males receive more grooming. This ensures that everybody has their place in the social hierarchy.
- It's a form of social lubrication that maintains harmony among chimpanzees.
- Gossip helps us relate to others and maintain relationships in the same way social grooming does for chimpanzees.
- It can serve a purpose or it can't (it can just pass the time.)
- Gossip can be the basis for forming relationships. Gossip always has the option of leading somewhere large and intimate, no matter how small it can start. It also doesn't need to be negative in nature, and even if it is , it will still help you bond.
- Talk about social relationships in particular. This really lends support to the conclusion that talking in general about people, yourself, or anything at all allows people to know you and like you.
- *Allow yourself to be exposed and open to other people. Establish a mutual level of comfort. If nothing else, it gets people to drop their guard.*
- When asked to read about positive traits, people observing the reader would described the reader positively, and negatively if they were reading negative traits.
- If you're not talking about yourself, people will make judgments about you based on how you describe other people. They equate how you read other people with your own personality traits.
- You have to watch how you describe other people, because people will pick you up on that.
- Compliment people behind their backs. Some people really feel comfortable talking negatively. If you can't say anything positive, then at least try to say something neutral.
