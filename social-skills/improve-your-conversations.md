## Improve Your Conversations

- Consciously ignore all the chatter in the world and focus on the person in front of me.
- Let go of my own self-consciousness and any agenda I had coming into the interaction since there was no guarantee it would ever come up, and I had to work with what the other person gave me.
- Flow: The ability to make something out of nothing. A conversation always has a flow, you just have to pay attention to it and catch before it fades.
- Eliminate awkward silences and make conversation flow smoothly.

### Improvisation Implementation

- Conversation--you can't read each other's minds. Fragile.
- Improv comedy show: the performers refer to themselves as players, just like teammates on a sports team.
- Absence of ego--no agenda other than to work together with the other players successfully.
- Spontaneity: no idea of how it's going to play out, because it's completely out of their control.
- If you go to a networking event with the idea of seeking a job, that's an expectation that will creep into all of your conversations, whether you realize it or not.
- If you speak to that same person and just seek to connect, chances are a very different connection would form.
- Emotional intelligence: when you understand what someone is trying to convey through their words or body language, and you understand what you yourself are conveying to others through the same.
- If someone conveys that they are angry and we completely miss it, an awkward and uncomfortable situation arises.
- *If you make it your goal to first and foremost create a playful and fun atmosphere within your conversations, avoiding interview mode and small talk, you will be able to achieve your other goals far more easily.*
- Display openness, solicit opinions and ask questions, put others in the spotlight and allow them to shine.


### Yes, and

- Drop whatever thought you had or story you wanted to tell.
- Agree with the other person's assertion. Let the other person know that you have accepted it as the new topic. There are no arguments or debates in improv, only collaboration and teamwork.
- Agree, then add another comment to build upon what they said.
- You want to send a signal to others that their words are important to you. Remember that the overall goal is to create a pleasurable experience, and nothing can be more pleasurable than feeling valued and validated.
- If you don't agree that much: "Yes, and where did you hear about that?"

### Read and React to Everything

- Reading people better: it stars with what they talk about, and how much they talk about it. People drop hints in conversation all the time.
- Non-verbal portion of reading people: you just need to know the baseline of body language of the other person.
- Breadcrumbs:
  - The excitement in someone's voice when you bring up a topic.
  - If someone keeps trying to bring up a topic, this means they want to talk about it.
  - If someone keeps looking away, this means that they are bored.
  - If you interrupted someone, ask them about it after you finish speaking to see what direction they were interested in going.
  - See if you can tell if their smiles and laughs are fake or real.
  - If someone ignores what you say and goes back to what they were talking about before you spoke, they feel strongly about their point and want to expand on it.
- *Whatever someone says or demonstrates to you through their body, they are doing it to create an emotional response.*
  - A story about their dog feeding a kitten? They want a happy smile.
  - A story about being cut off in traffic? They want shared agony.
  - A statement about their foot being run over by a bike? They want a laugh.
- It pays to be slightly dramatic and overboard with your emotional reaction, because big reactions make people feel good.

### Be More Specific

- "What do you like to do for fun?" is much better phrased as, "Do you like to play music for fun? What about hiking or writing?"
- "Do you like the Beatles, or is your style more Mozart, or is it more Bruce Springsteen?"
- "Did you do anything over the weekend, like shopping, hiking, or did you just relax in front of the television?" as opposed to "What did you do over the weekend?"
- Leading statement: "You must be really great at tennis." "Sounds like that wasn't a very fun party." "You must have hated that." "I bet you're a big foodie."

### Details, Details, Details

- Giving details: Things are more interesting if there is a 3-D description of the context and characters involved.
- Gives people more elements or words to connect to, think about, and attach themselves to.
- Details remind people of their own lives and memories, and make them feel more drawn to whatever is presenting them. They create pangs of nostalgia and make people reminisce.
- You can include details about specific songs that played during your high school dances.
- Better reaction if you include details about the tragic and chilling nature of your annual family ski trip.
- If people want to talk about something, they hint about it with more details that they want others to pick up on.

### No "No"

- Short term effects: awkwardness, confusion, tension, disrupting a conversational flow.
- Long term effects: they will stop opening up to or bringing anything up with you.
- Sales tactic: "Would you like to save money?" Creating a flow of positivity, and that positivity leads to sales because people imaging what they are missing by not having what is sold.
- Sales = selling a dream, and saying "no" destroys the possibility of that dream subconsciously.
- Overall conversations are about working toward a common shared goal, through one of both parties may not always realize it.

### Create Motion

- The people in a conversation or an improv will have an easier time if they intentionally create motion and seek to introduce new elements.
- Plan for your conversations to resemble stories and movies, and learn about specific types of motion you can introduce on the fly.
- You want to see unique, interesting, and exaggerated parts. Conflict, problem solving, and then resolution. These are all accomplished by creating motion in normal conversation topics, and not just staying in one place.
- The great myths and stories share certain elements in common. Regardless of whom the stories are told to, they are always effective because they hit on certain classic themes contained in the Hero Cycle.
- *The hero starts at point A, and a situation arises that necessitates that the hero goes to point B. On the way back from point B to point A, certain conflicts and resolutions occur, and the hero is forever transformed.*
- Great stories/conversations are journeys. There is a sense of direction, a sense of conflict that needs resolution, and there is a sense of tension that needs to be unwound. It's not a preset place that you end up, and there's a sense of closure. There's a payoff, and that's what creating motion does.

### It's Entertainment, Not Discussion

- The reality of most people's lives is that the bulk of our time is spent experiencing very mundane things.
- Humans are social creatures with limited brain capacity, so we gravitate toward entertainment. Entertainment is the common thread that will allow anything you want from an interaction to flow naturally, from sales to networking to romance.
- "I'm going to the grocery, do you want anything?" "Haven't you had enough chocolate today?"
- "What kind of shoes are these?" "I think we're too poor to know this brand."
- What do you speak to your friends about? Then talk to everyone you come across on those topics as well.
- People speak to everyone like they are already a friend.
- People are not that sensitive. People just imagine that they are.
- The goal is not to inform somebody, nor lay out a package of information, nor convince someone to buy from you, but to make people entertained by your presence.
- "I can't believe we're actually talking about work." if you are talking about boring stuff.
- Treat your conversations as entertainment and not discussion. Play Devil's advocate. Compare something to a Disney movie plot. Ask personal questions. Answer questions in movie or song quotes. Completely change topics. Think out loud about questions you have about life. Ask hypothetical questions based on what you see around you. Ask a rhetorical, provocative question and see if they bite.

### Think On Your Feet

- If people are able to perceive your agenda, guess what happens? They will shut you out.
- If it become clear that you are only waiting for your turn to speak, and not actually listening to people.
- When you create an agenda, you memorize it and become reliant on it.
- Capacity for quick thought: practice it. Get your favorite quick-witted television show and pretend you are one of the characters. Think of how fast you can create a reply to a comment.
- Free association exercises.
- Response structure: restate, state an emotion, and ask a question.
  - "You punched him in the face? That must have been satisfying. How did it feel after?"
  - "Did you like the coffee?" "Did I like the coffee? Well I'm in a great mood now, so I guess I did. What kind was it?"
- Practice talking about topics you know absolutely nothing about.

### Support Your Teammates

- To be an amazing supporting actor: shine the spotlight onto the other person and their thoughts.
- Keep focused on their topics, such as themselves, their interests, their friends, and their hobbies. Try to resist talking about yourself much, and in fact, maintain a 2:1 ratio of questions to stories about yourself, unless you are adding details to beef up their stories.
- Ask for their opinions on topics "because you figured they might know something about it." You want to hear their opinion "because they know a lot about it."
- People typically enjoy acting as a teacher and having their knowledge recognized by others, so put them into that position and ask them implicitly to teach you about those topics. People are never shy or short of words on topics they are experts on, especially if there is someone eager to learn from them.
- You are continually on the hunt to extract more engagement from them.
- Whatever someone is saying, they are doing it to create an emotional response, and there are some reactions they might be seeking.

### Remember and Callback

- Callback--a statement, question, or joke that refers to something that was mentioned earlier in the conversation.
- Humorous callbacks: element of surprise. Expectations are ignored or completely defied, which shocks people into an emotional reaction. If we can accept that this is the basis for much of humor, then callbacks introduce a higher level of surprise by linking two elements that have no business being close to each other.
- Beyond the humor, a psychological benefit to callbacks is that you make people feel heard and important.

### Shut Up More

- *If anyone you engage with answers your questions about them, but doesn't pause to ask how you're doing, then they need to shut up more. If that's you, then you're the one who needs to shut up more.*
- If you are letting the other person speak simply because you feel like you shouldn't be speaking for so long at ones stretch, you are just waiting for your turn to speak.
- Don't interrupt others unless you agree with them so emphatically that you can finish their sentence with them.
- If you do interrupt them for any reason, ask them immediately after you finish speaking what they were saying and bring it back to them.
- Try to abide by the two-second rule to police yourself--after someone finishes speaking, pause for a full two seconds while contemplating what they've said and externally demonstrate that you are analyzing their words. Then, and only then, may you reply.
- To improve conversations, you just need to shut up more. This might be the simplest lesson of the book. You can't learn when you're speaking, and overdoing it makes you fundamentally unlikable.

### Use HPM

- History, philosophy, and metaphor.
- Respond to whatever was said in a personal way. Personal experience, story, or exposure with the topic at hand.
- Personal involvement--if somebody uses this technique on you, you'd feel more open and engaged with them since sharing personal stories is something that friends do.
- Philosophy: personal opinions, stances, beliefs, and attitudes towards the topic at hand. This is where you demonstrate how you feel about something.
  - Someone lost expensive sunglasses: "That's why I'm a believer in cheap, crappy sunglasses."
  - If you don't feel completely comfortable sharing your opinions because you don't want to be judged, then that's why this response is so important.
- Metaphor: What can you compare it to, what is familiar, and what does it remind you of?
   - "Roller coasters are like charities, I donate so many things because I lose something every time I ride one!"
   - "Losing things is like when you have a rock in your shoe, it's so annoying."

### Improv Potpourri

- Make specific statements.
- Instead of "what are your hobbies", say "you seem like you're really into cars."
- Not every statement has to make a profoundly funny impact or make people laugh.
- Assuming you're not a professional comedian, lay off the puns and jokes and just stay in the flow of things.
- Focus on observing the other person, the context of the topics, the stories, the absurdity of everyday life, and the people that are involved.
- Practice. There's a reason why people involved in improv comedy are called players, and why performances are treated like sports matches.
- Timing, reaction to others, ignoring their normal instincts, being more specific, thinking on their feet, how to deal with certain situations and topics, what their comfort zones are, what they are good at, what they are bad at, reading other people, they can literally never practice enough because there are so many variables in human interaction.
- People who are bad conversationalists--they do not want to try, or they have tried and tried, failed, and they do not want to try again. They experience discomfort, unfamiliarity, and awkwardness and decide that they can't take it anymore and don't want to face it.
- People need to embrace intentionality, know exactly what they are doing, and what they should be working on when they practice. This is easier if you have a practice partner, preferable one that knows what you are working on.
