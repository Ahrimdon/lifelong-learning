## Improve Your Conversations

- Consciously ignore all the chatter in the world and focus on the person in front of me.
- Let go of my own self-consciousness and any agenda I had coming into the interaction since there was no guarantee it would ever come up, and I had to work with what the other person gave me.
- Flow: The ability to make something out of nothing. A conversation always has a flow, you just have to pay attention to it and catch before it fades.
- Eliminate awkward silences and make conversation flow smoothly.

### Improvisation Implementation

- Conversation--you can't read each other's minds. Fragile.
- Improv comedy show: the performers refer to themselves as players, just like teammates on a sports team.
- Absence of ego--no agenda other than to work together with the other players successfully.
- Spontaneity: no idea of how it's going to play out, because it's completely out of their control.
- If you go to a networking event with the idea of seeking a job, that's an expectation that will creep into all of your conversations, whether you realize it or not.
- If you speak to that same person and just seek to connect, chances are a very different connection would form.
- Emotional intelligence: when you understand what someone is trying to convey through their words or body language, and you understand what you yourself are conveying to others through the same.
- If someone conveys that they are angry and we completely miss it, an awkward and uncomfortable situation arises.
- *If you make it your goal to first and foremost create a playful and fun atmosphere within your conversations, avoiding interview mode and small talk, you will be able to achieve your other goals far more easily.*
- Display openness, solicit opinions and ask questions, put others in the spotlight and allow them to shine.


### Yes, and

- Drop whatever thought you had or story you wanted to tell.
- Agree with the other person's assertion. Let the other person know that you have accepted it as the new topic. There are no arguments or debates in improv, only collaboration and teamwork.
- Agree, then add another comment to build upon what they said.
- You want to send a signal to others that their words are important to you. Remember that the overall goal is to create a pleasurable experience, and nothing can be more pleasurable than feeling valued and validated.
- If you don't agree that much: "Yes, and where did you hear about that?"

### Read and React to Everything

- Reading people better: it stars with what they talk about, and how much they talk about it. People drop hints in conversation all the time.
- Non-verbal portion of reading people: you just need to know the baseline of body language of the other person.
- Breadcrumbs:
  - The excitement in someone's voice when you bring up a topic.
  - If someone keeps trying to bring up a topic, this means they want to talk about it.
  - If someone keeps looking away, this means that they are bored.
  - If you interrupted someone, ask them about it after you finish speaking to see what direction they were interested in going.
  - See if you can tell if their smiles and laughs are fake or real.
  - If someone ignores what you say and goes back to what they were talking about before you spoke, they feel strongly about their point and want to expand on it.
- *Whatever someone says or demonstrates to you through their body, they are doing it to create an emotional response.*
  - A story about their dog feeding a kitten? They want a happy smile.
  - A story about being cut off in traffic? They want shared agony.
  - A statement about their foot being run over by a bike? They want a laugh.
- It pays to be slightly dramatic and overboard with your emotional reaction, because big reactions make people feel good.

### Be More Specific

- "What do you like to do for fun?" is much better phrased as, "Do you like to play music for fun? What about hiking or writing?"
- "Do you like the Beatles, or is your style more Mozart, or is it more Bruce Springsteen?"
- "Did you do anything over the weekend, like shopping, hiking, or did you just relax in front of the television?" as opposed to "What did you do over the weekend?"
- Leading statement: "You must be really great at tennis." "Sounds like that wasn't a very fun party." "You must have hated that." "I bet you're a big foodie."

### Details, Details, Details

- Giving details: Things are more interesting if there is a 3-D description of the context and characters involved.
- Gives people more elements or words to connect to, think about, and attach themselves to.
- Details remind people of their own lives and memories, and make them feel more drawn to whatever is presenting them. They create pangs of nostalgia and make people reminisce.
- You can include details about specific songs that played during your high school dances.
- Better reaction if you include details about the tragic and chilling nature of your annual family ski trip.
- If people want to talk about something, they hint about it with more details that they want others to pick up on.

### No "No"

- Short term effects: awkwardness, confusion, tension, disrupting a conversational flow.
- Long term effects: they will stop opening up to or bringing anything up with you.
- Sales tactic: "Would you like to save money?" Creating a flow of positivity, and that positivity leads to sales because people imaging what they are missing by not having what is sold.
- Sales = selling a dream, and saying "no" destroys the possibility of that dream subconsciously.
- Overall conversations are about working toward a common shared goal, through one of both parties may not always realize it.

### Create Motion

- The people in a conversation or an improv will have an easier time if they intentionally create motion and seek to introduce new elements.
- Plan for your conversations to resemble stories and movies, and learn about specific types of motion you can introduce on the fly.
- You want to see unique, interesting, and exaggerated parts. Conflict, problem solving, and then resolution. These are all accomplished by creating motion in normal conversation topics, and not just staying in one place.
- The great myths and stories share certain elements in common. Regardless of whom the stories are told to, they are always effective because they hit on certain classic themes contained in the Hero Cycle.
- *The hero starts at point A, and a situation arises that necessitates that the hero goes to point B. On the way back from point B to point A, certain conflicts and resolutions occur, and the hero is forever transformed.*
- Great stories/conversations are journeys. There is a sense of direction, a sense of conflict that needs resolution, and there is a sense of tension that needs to be unwound. It's not a preset place that you end up, and there's a sense of closure. There's a payoff, and that's what creating motion does.
