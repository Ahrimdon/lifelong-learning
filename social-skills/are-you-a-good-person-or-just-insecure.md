- What makes someone a good person?
- Good is derived from what we've learned early on from out parents, religions, peers, siblings, other authorities.
  - Authoritative parents: You are 'good' if you are being submissive and not voice your opinion.
  - Emotionally immature parents: You take responsibility for too much things.
  - Overly demanding parents: You are "good" if you never make mistakes.
- How this affects people: working overtime so you can show your boss how dedicated you are to things, while hating your boss for not acknowledging it; being cooperative with coworkers at your own expense, while being frustrated for not standing up for yourself; putting everyone's needs before your own, but being resentful deep inside because no one sees and values how far you are stretched.
- *Doing good because not doing it would paint us in a bad way is not a good motive.*
- Being good means doing good out of the right reason. The motivation behind something good is the key difference. Doing good just for the sake of doing good also makes us feel good instead of frustrated, resentful, and angry, which is what we feel when we feel pressured into doing good.

### How to change your underlying motive?

- *Detect.* Inductive reasoning: ask yourself in a specific situation what is the motivation behind your action. Are you doing good because it's the right thing to do, or because not doing it would make you seem bad? What does it feel like, being good?
- *Deflect.*
- *Respect.* Respect yourself. Make a conscious choice to have higher regard for your personal boundaries. If you like overtime, do it, but only if it makes you feel happy instead of frustrated. Don't resent other people when you do good things.
- *By being kind to yourself, by respecting yourself, you won't have the need to prove to others how 'good' you are by demeaning yourself in any way. True satisfaction of doing good come from a conscious choice to do good, not from being coerced into it.*
