## Are you a good person, or just insecure?

- What makes someone a good person?
- Good is derived from what we've learned early on from out parents, religions, peers, siblings, other authorities.
  - Authoritative parents: You are 'good' if you are being submissive and not voice your opinion.
  - Emotionally immature parents: You take responsibility for too much things.
  - Overly demanding parents: You are "good" if you never make mistakes.
- How this affects people: working overtime so you can show your boss how dedicated you are to things, while hating your boss for not acknowledging it; being cooperative with coworkers at your own expense, while being frustrated for not standing up for yourself; putting everyone's needs before your own, but being resentful deep inside because no one sees and values how far you are stretched.
- *Doing good because not doing it would paint us in a bad way is not a good motive.*
- Being good means doing good out of the right reason. The motivation behind something good is the key difference. Doing good just for the sake of doing good also makes us feel good instead of frustrated, resentful, and angry, which is what we feel when we feel pressured into doing good.

### How to change your underlying motive?

- *Detect.* Inductive reasoning: ask yourself in a specific situation what is the motivation behind your action. Are you doing good because it's the right thing to do, or because not doing it would make you seem bad? What does it feel like, being good?
- *Deflect.*
- *Respect.* Respect yourself. Make a conscious choice to have higher regard for your personal boundaries. If you like overtime, do it, but only if it makes you feel happy instead of frustrated. Don't resent other people when you do good things.
- *By being kind to yourself, by respecting yourself, you won't have the need to prove to others how 'good' you are by demeaning yourself in any way. True satisfaction of doing good come from a conscious choice to do good, not from being coerced into it.*

- *Strong eye contact.*
  - Gaze, not stare. Stare = news anchor reading a teleprompter. Gaze = how your eyes might look when you see three puppies playing and fighting over a stuffed cow.
  - Move your eyes around, but on their face.
  - Exercise: With sunglasses on, look at people in the eye in the park.
- *Prepare yourself mentally and physically.*
  - Listen to hype music or awesome speeches.
  - Technique: Read things out loud.
- *React with Importance.*
  - When a joke isn't funny, at least acknowledge it, right?
  - The absence of a reaction causes a disconnect between two people.
  - Technique: Pick out the primary emotion, and try to predict the reaction they are seeking from you.
- *Don't answer literally.*
  - They probably don't care about your weekend, they just want to hear something interesting from you, and most of the time, answering questions literally will provide the opposite of that.
- *Curiouser than the dead cat.*
  - Being curious about someone can put you far above the fold.
  - Ask many questions and go deeper into a topic. You'd essentially be a question master, and that makes you favorable. People love talking about themselves.
- *The king of stories.*
  - Prepare funny stories that can answer this question.
- *Keep the flow.*
  - If people are affected on an emotional level, they share topics or whatever.
  - Stay on the message that other people want and show them you feel it too. Take a step back and think about the purpose that someone is telling you.
