## 7 Hand Gestures You Should Be Using

- Show the number on your hand for numbers.
- When saying "big", gesture "big" or "small" (gesture "small").
- Emotion: "hand close to the heart".
- Republicans are "this" (grasp) and democrats are this (grasp somewhere else).
- Emblem: point with a semi thumbs up on the fist.
- "You", "me", "we".
- Jazz hands: Gestures that don't match your words.

## How to Talk to Strangers

- *The warm-up.* Send out "friend signals". Open body language, visible hands for the handshake, direct eye contact.
- *The opener.* "Hey, how are you?"
- *The shake.* Dry and firm (lol).
- *The thing I didn't write down.* Who you are and how you've arrived. "Hi, I'm Vanessa, I'm new here."
- If possible, try to do things around food and drink.

- The Similarity Attraction Effect. People like people who are like them. Similar interests, similar values, and those who look more like us.
- Dress as close to the person you are selling to.
- Search for similarities. Are we both drinking red wine, do we both know the host, etc.
- Capitalize similarities. Double down on "yeah, cilantro tastes like soap."
- Extend similarities. You want to make it a conversation diving board.

## 7 Things You Should Never Do on a Date

- Anything that comes after the phase "my mom says" is bad. You don't want to visualize your mom.
- No politics.
- Don't ask them how many dates they've been on. Comparing numbers is just bad. Don't talk about the dating app.
- "When I was with my ex".
- If you aren't proud of what you're saying, don't say anything about it. Don't be inappropriate.

## The 5 Best First Date Questions

- "Are you working on any personal passion projects?", as opposed to "what are your hobbies?"
- "What's the best present you've ever given someone?"
- "What does a typical day look like for you?" Career thingies naturally appear naturally.
- "What sort of vacations do you like to take?" Talking about travel can result in a second dates.
- "Anything surprising happening today?"

## Confident Body Language Boosters
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK_eZR8r3Gg)

- Claiming territory. The more volume your body takes up, the more confident you appear. Head out, arms out/power pose. People feel more confident and they also look more confident (to the person they're talking to).
- Safe zone, not the arms on waist power pose.
- Men rate women as untrustworthy if they have the inflection thingie. Practice asking a question going down tone-wise at the end. Believe your own words.
- Leaning is a powerful non-verbal cue.

- First impression on audio/the phone.
- Recording the same people with different micro-expressions even on just the tone of voice.
- The anger micro-expression: Tightening your eyebrows and your lips. Lower likeability, but higher in confidence.
- Anger: if a man is angry, he is confident in his perception of himself. This is why "the angry hello" is perceived as competent.
- Power posing--Jordan stopped doing it, and now we read that on Scientific American, we can't replicate this power posing thing. Athletes across different cultures make the same gesture when they win the race. Universally, when you feel pride, you expand your space, and when you feel defeated, you crumble in.
- Academia publish or perish--hopefully we can usher a new era of research with different research subjects.
- "And science moves in the 1% towards the direction that Art of Charm has been doing."
- What does "being authentic" or "being nice" mean in terms of what made them up?
  - Be as comfortable with this stranger, but somehow do this in the first x minutes.
  - Why are cool kids mysterious? The science of popularity.
    - The most popular kids smiled the most during the day. (Boring)
    - They liked the most other of their other classmates, something like the "be interested in other people." How can I find a way to like them?
    - Liking the nerds and the jocks meant that the nerds and the jocks also like you. "Hey how are you" stuff hehe.
- Shark Tank entrepreneurs: The most successful ones smiled at the sharks.
  - Look for the person who will most probably like you?
  - "Come sit with me"--the more people you can rescue at a mixer or at a conference, the better it is?
  - Events: Know the best coffee place in the area or "I saw this on Yelp." Attracting your people: You want to be open, but you want to be at the same level of open with the other person.
  - Same with conscientiousness, I like to be conscientious so I will show to other people that I am organized.
- Neuroticism: Serotonin makes us feel calm. Neurotics produce less serotonin and it takes them longer for them to calm down. Don't tell them to "calm down".
  - This means there is an actual chemical reaction that slows things down.
  - This is why opposites are good in neurotics (someone who can prevent a crisis and someone who is calm in a crisis).
  - This is why you can call low neuroticism people if you are in a crisis.
  - You cannot change someone's personality that much. With age, women tend to be more extroverted and men tend to be more open.
  - You can outsource your weaknesses to your partner.
- I started first to write for everyone. Problem is, no one liked it (few avid readers).
  - Indicator of interest: "This is not for you", instead of trying to appeal to 10% of the fishes you want, not 90% of the fishes you don't want.
  - The enemy of dating is going on ambivalent dates, not bad dates. The problem with those is that they drag on for weeks and months.
  - If you do not have indicators of interest, then you are more likely to waste your time trying to write for every time.
  - Just say your deal breakers. Ex: Vegan, or you do not want to date a vegan.
- Things to think about
  - Dietary restrictions.
  - Morning or night person.
  - What you do to relax (not have fun). If you want to recover from a long week, what do you do? Party or relaxing at home.
  - If you're asking yourself, "Can I do better?", then there is something wrong.
- Business/social crushes, a magnetic desire to be with someone.
  - The more we can think about that, the more it brings a spice to life.
  - Oxytocin: safety/belonging. The more touch there was in the first few minutes (breaking physical contact).
  - For women: are we safe with this person. If there is no touch with the first few minutes, and it isn't answered.
  - If a man is good in bed or not: the way they walk.
  - This is why dancing is such a precursor to stuff.
  - The reaction the woman gives to the touch can set up how the date works. If they don't accept, then you have to steer to show you are safe for her.
  - If the touch didn't go well, then you can say the "I have to be at so-and-so by this time" to just reinforce that you aren't a serial killer, hehe.
  - High success: When the men that showed up looked like you're greeting an old friend. The Pygmalion effect.
  - "You know, I really click with you, I feel like I've been a friend with you for a long time."
- Hot Or Not scores.
  - Hottest men showed skin, hottest women didn't.
  - Buzzkill prop: Sunglasses. Dogs are good. Bathroom is a bad context.
  - Best angle: Straight on. Angled-up photos are good for authority, angled-down is submissive.
  - Best context: Outdoors, but not sunglasses. Smize.
  - Closed mouth smile: bad. Men: neutral face. Women: Only the big smile, not RBF. RBF: If your facial features angle downwards. Make sure you don't have downward-facing features.
  - Don't tell someone to smile, and "you're so much shorter or taller than I thought."
  - Hands or no hands? Hands because they are a trust indicator. For women, if they do a self-touch, it foreshadows a "nice level of touch."
  - The mark of a hot woman: The Monroe gaze. Exposing the chin/neck mean pheromones, mirrors the orgasm face, sultry look.
