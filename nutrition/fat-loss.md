## Understanding Eating for Fat Loss
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bx3ybehrD4&feature=youtu.be)

- You support the body, not starve the body to get fat loss.
- You want to strip down what is already there.
- Lean gain: At least 6 months.
- Basic fact of losing weight: Calories in - calories out. You have to control the deficit that you have.
- Mental attitude: Understanding how you are going to look and how you are going to feel.
- Dieting: Realistic expectations. These come with time. Density of muscle/mass of muscle.
- Genetics: It doesn't matter what somebody else looks like. What matters is you. Your body runs in its own way.
- Food: Your body only understands what you put into it. It breaks down whatever you eat into carbs, proteins, and fats. Micronutrients control your nutrition, but not your physique.
- Dieting: At least monitor macros and calories. Sugar foods suck compared to potatoes so you get a bigger volume for the same.
- All foods must be controlled. Monitor your macros. This sort of means weighing your food.
- Weigh your shit, but if you are going to eat the same thing anyway, then you can log it in one go to save time.
