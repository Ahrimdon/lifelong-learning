# Understanding Eating for Fat Loss
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bx3ybehrD4&feature=youtu.be)

- You support the body, not starve the body to get fat loss.
- You want to strip down what is already there.
- Lean gain: At least 6 months.
- Basic fact of losing weight: Calories in - calories out. You have to control the deficit that you have.
- Mental attitude: Understanding how you are going to look and how you are going to feel.
- Dieting: Realistic expectations. These come with time. Density of muscle/mass of muscle.
- Genetics: It doesn't matter what somebody else looks like. What matters is you. Your body runs in its own way.
- Food: Your body only understands what you put into it. It breaks down whatever you eat into carbs, proteins, and fats. Micronutrients control your nutrition, but not your physique.
- Dieting: At least monitor macros and calories. Sugar foods suck compared to potatoes so you get a bigger volume for the same.
- All foods must be controlled. Monitor your macros. This sort of means weighing your food.
- Weigh your shit, but if you are going to eat the same thing anyway, then you can log it in one go to save time.

- Cycling's aerobic nature means you are burning fat.
- Low intensity (less than 80% max heart rate) 3x a week for about 2 hours.
- ***Burns greater % of fat, but overall calorie burning would be less for the same duration.***
- Crunches are good for core strength, but they won't remove fat.
- Combining strength training with aerobic exercise can increase the calorie burn.
- You can't just starve yourself, because doing so means your body will start dropping muscle mass rather than fat.
- Stress contributes to the storage of belly fat.

- Fasted training!
- Carbs don't just fuel the body, they nourish the mind, too.
- Get better by exercising in zones that encourage fat conversion. Start off every ride early in a fasted state and cycling for up to 2 hours at zone 2 and zone 3 to force fat to burn.
- Increase muscle, so there would be more things that burn fat.
