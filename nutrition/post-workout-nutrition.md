## All About Post-Workout Nutrition

- The body deals with nutrients differently at different times, depending on activity.
- What you consume before, during, and after your workout is important.
- By consuming particular nutrients after your workouts, you improve your body composition, performance, and overall recovery.

#### Post workout nutrition purposes

- Replenish glycogen/energy stores
- Decrease protein breakdown (repair damage caused by the workout)
- Increase protein synthesis (increase muscle size and/or quality)

Benefits of good post-workout nutrition: Improved recovery, less muscle soreness, increased ability to build muscle, improved immune function, improved bone mass, improved ability to use body fat

Working out means we damage our tissues (this makes us stronger), which need to be repaired. Muscle protein synthesis increases slightly, while protein breakdown increases dramatically. *We're doing a lot more breaking-down than building-up.*

Muscle hypertrophy occurs when a positive protein balance can be established during recovery — in other words, when we make sure we have enough raw materials available for protein synthesis to occur, so that it doesn't lag behind protein breakdown.

Stored carbohydrates can also be depleted. *Thus, during the post-workout period, we require protein and carbohydrates.*

#### What you should know about workout nutrition

- *Availability.* In order for our bodies to use raw materials to rebuild and recover, those raw materials have to be available. To improve availability, we: increase blood flow to skeletal muscles during and after exercise, and provide an amino acid and glucose dense blood supply during and after exercise.
- *The window of opportunity.* While protein synthesis persists for at least 48 hours after exercise, it's most important to get post-workout nutrition immediately, and within 2 hours afterwards. If you feed your body properly while this window is open, you'll get the benefits.  *If you don't provide adequate post exercise nutrition fast enough — even if you delay by only a couple of hours — you decrease muscle glycogen storage and protein synthesis.*

#### What to eat

- Contains protein to aid in protein synthesis
- Carbs to replace muscle glycogen
- Whole food meals aren't practical since this digests slowly and some people aren't hungry after anyway.
- Liquid form of nutrition with rapidly digesting carbs and proteins (about 20 grams) might: accelerate recovery, results in rapid digestion and absorption, and is often better tolerated during and after workout.
- Save your workout drink for weight training, interval, and endurance training lasting 45 minutes or longer.
- When performing energy expenditure work to burn energy or lose fat, a recovery drink is not necessary. *If you’re prioritizing fat loss, performance and recovery from these sessions are not as important as creating an energy deficit.*

#### Summary and Recommendations

- With intense workouts/training, start by ingesting 30 grams of carbohydrate and 15 grams of protein (in 500 ml water) per hour of workout time.
- You can sip this during the workout or consume it immediately after.
- Once your workout is complete, have a whole food meal within an hour or two.
- If priority #1 is to lose body fat, use only BCAAs (branched chain amino acids) as a workout drink. About 5 to 15 grams per hour of training (200 pounds or more = closer to 15 grams, 200 pounds or less = closer to 5 grams).
- *When choosing carbohydrates, keep in mind that glucose is absorbed faster than fructose, and solutions high in fructose have been linked to gastrointestinal distress, greater fatigue, and higher cortisol levels.*
