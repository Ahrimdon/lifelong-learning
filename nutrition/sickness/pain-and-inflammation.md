## FOOD RX FOR PAIN & INFLAMMATION
[Reference](http://blog.outdoorherbivore.com/food-301/foods-for-pain/)

- Vitamin I (Ibuprofen) hehe.
- Inflammation: burning/heat sensation.
- Acute inflammation: Curable within a few hours or days.
- Chronic inflammation: When the body is continuously exposed to irritants and becomes chronically inflamed. Rheumatoid arthritis, celiacs disease.
- The process: You get a splinter, cells get damaged, foreign pathogens enter the body. Cells release histamine and cytokines to alert the body of damage. As bacteria get destroyed, platelets form clots to close up the wound.
  - Problem: when inflammation becomes chronic, or the immune cells attack healthy cells.

### Foods:

- Turmeric. About one teaspoon per day of powdered turmeric with food. Mustard on sandwiches. Add turmeric with black pepper.
- Ginger. One teaspoon per day of powdered ginger with food after hiking or exercise. Drink ginger ale when in town.
- Garlic. Allicin, which is release when garlic is cut or crushed. Garlic is excreted from our sweat, so it can work from the inside out.
- Chili peppers. Red or cayenne pepper for pain relief.
- Omega-3 fatty acids.
  - Salmon, anchovies, sardines, rainbow trout, mackerel, chia seeds, walnuts, olive oil, sunflower seeds.
- Fruits: berries, bananas, plantain, raisins, dates,
- Cold water/soaking.
- Cold, smooth stones.
- Bark from trees containing salicylates.
- Mint/wild leek.

### These promote inflammation:

- Meat: Our body uses protein to repair itself, but meat is difficult to digest, and too much protein can lead to increased pain. Focus on eating carbohydrates from whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.
- Saturated/trans fats.
- Refined sugar/white flour.
- OTC anti-inflammatory drugs: are okay, but don't rely on them long-term.
