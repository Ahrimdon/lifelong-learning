- Raw:  pungent, caramelized: sweet silkiness.
- Saute: means to fry something quickly in a small amount of fat. As onions cook, they will take on a sweeter, caramel-like aroma and they will lose a lot of volume.
- Sweating the onions: You can put salt on the onions, this will draw the moisture out of them (sweating them). They will start to glisten and look wet.
- Translucent.
- Brown: They will have a sweet, slightly caramel-like aroma.
- Cook until caramelized--20 to 45 minutes total cooking time, a browned glaze will develop on the bottom of the pan. When you think the onions are done, splash a little water or win into the pan to dissolve the glaze.
