- Bad: white or black patches on a cut one and green/white mold on the outside.
- Freshest: thin smooth skins have more juice than thicker, bumpy skin.
- Whole lemons stay good for up to one week at room temperature and 2-3 weeks in the refrigerator. Cut lemons stay good for 3-4 days in the fridge. Wrap them in plastic to extend their shelf life.
- In soft or high moisture foods like tomatoes, peaches, or lemons, there's a good chance that any mold you see has spread invisible to other parts.
