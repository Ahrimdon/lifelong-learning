- *Helps with Digestion.* Lemon water has a citric acid that interacts with the enzymes of your body to produce health liver bile. This helps to keep food moving smoothly through your system.
- *Helps keep Skin Healthy and Clear.* Lemon water is LOADED with vitamin C and thus, many antioxidants. These fight damage done by free radicals to keep your skin looking fresh. The vitamin c also keeps the body producing natural collagen essential to keeping skin young and healthy looking.
- *Can help with weight loss.* Sipping on lemon water throughout your day can help you shed a few pounds as well. Lemon water contains pectin fiber, which helps to fight hunger cravings and keeps you more satiated from your meals.
