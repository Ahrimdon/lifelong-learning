## Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Black and White Pepper?
[Reference](https://www.chowhound.com/food-news/138263/whats-the-difference-between-black-and-white-pepper/)

- Both from the pepper plant.
- Black: when almost ripe and sun-dried, so black. More complex and is less hot.
- White: outer layer is removed before or after drying. Hotter but is less complex. Easier to turn stale and bitter than black. For aesthetic reasons (no black flecks).
