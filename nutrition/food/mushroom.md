[Reference](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/27713/how-to-properly-saut%C3%A9-mushrooms-so-that-they-dont-release-water)

- Do not crowd the pan with water.
- Add all the chopped mushrooms to a pan with medium heat and cover.
- The mushrooms steam and release their own water, allow to cook for a good 5-10 minutes.
- When the pan is hot, add some tablespoons of oil and throw in the mushrooms.
- When they are browned, deglaze the pan with the mushroom water.
- Fry in smaller batches, this prevents too much water being released at once, which prevents efficient evaporation.
