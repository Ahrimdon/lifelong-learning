- Classic method of pan-cooking a steak leads to uneven cooking when dealing with thicker cuts.
- Preheating the pan: When adding the meat, you should hear the "tss".
- Take the meat out of the fridge 15 minutes before you intend to cook it.
- Salt brings out the flavor in the meat and it helps caramelize the meat, forming the crust you're looking for.
- High heat: You need a hot pan to properly sear meat. The hotter the pan, the more the caramelization and color.

- Boneless NY strip or rib-eye, season well with kosher salt for just 30 minutes before you plan to cook it, and finally cook it hot and fast with no oil to start and some butter to finish.
- Boneless steaks that are between one and one-and-a-half inches thick. Thicker cuts like a New York strip steak or a boneless rib-eye work best for this method. Look for a steak with plentiful marbling (white fat that runs through the meat).
- This would work with steaks that fall under one inch, although the overall process of cooking these cuts happens much faster.
- Hot pan can burn pepper/steak seasoning for pan-seared steaks. The extremely hot pan will burn these spices before they can flavor the steak.
- Searing is about creating a crisp crust on the outside that adds a ton of flavor to the finished steak.
- About halfway through cooking, add a few tablespoons of butter, herbs, and aromatics to make a hot baste for finishing the steak.
- Oil can inhibit browning, which slows searing.
- Easiest way to check for doneness is checking the temperature.
- Medium-rare is about 8 minutes total cooking.

- Preparing: remover from refrigerator about 30 minutes to 1 hour before cooking. Place them on a paper-towel lined plate and pat dry with more paper towels. This will help dry the surface of the meet, making a better crust.
- Halfway through the cook, add butter, garlic, and herbs to the pan. Tilt the pan so the butter pools on one side and use a large spoon to baste the butter over the steaks.
- Steaks give off a considerable amount of fat which will act like olive oil, thus preventing the butter from burning.
- Cast iron is the best for cooking steak.
- Salting for about 20 minutes, then add the garlic salt/butter/pepper mixture at the end.
