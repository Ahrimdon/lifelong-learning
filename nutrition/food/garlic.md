- Like onions, leeks, and scallions, are part of the allium family.
- Pungent/bitter, but becomes mild and sweet when sauteed or baked.
- Used for a flavoring agent but can be eaten as a vegetable.
- Buying: firm, plum bulbs with their skin intact. No blemishes, no soft spots.
- Storage: Cool, dark place, can survive for 4-6 months. If a garlic has been chopped, it should be refrigerated.
- Tips
  - **Place garlic cloves in the microwave for 15 seconds and the skins should peel off easily.**
  - To add garlic flavor to your salad, you can cut a raw garlic clove in half and rub the inside of your bowl with the cut edge of the clove.

- Green stem inside: the garlic is past its prime. You can still use this clove, but remove the green stem before cooking.
- Garlic can act as a great addition to a grilling marinade, but since it burns easily (especially on the grill), it’s best to use whole crushed cloves when mixing your marinade, removing them before you start grilling.
- Is your ivory-coloured garlic is suddenly a blue-green colour? When garlic is minced in its raw form and comes into contact with an acid (lemon juice, vinegar), the acid begins to break down the garlic, changing its composition. This alteration creates a reaction with garlic’s amino acids and a blue-green colour results. (This colour change is harmless, except to the appearance of your dish.)

## 4 Tips for How to Cook With Garlic

- Fresh, not bottled garlic.
- For maximum health benefits, cut the garlic clove and then wit for 10-15 minutes before cooking to allow the compounds to fully develop.
- The more you damage the garlic's cell walls, the more sulfide-transforming enzymes you release--and with them, a more pungent flavor. Since crushing breaks the most cells, crushed garlic cloves taste harsher, sliced or chopped cloves milder.
- Getting rid of garlic breath: nibble parsley and drink milk.

## Garlic Powder vs Garlic
[Reference](http://www.myrecipes.com/ingredients/whats-the-difference-between-garlic-powder-and-fresh-garlic)

- Powder: a ground and dried out version of the fresh garlic bulb.
  - Less prone to fresh burning. You can use this for garlic bread.
  - Dry rubs. No matter how beautifully you mince it, it will not disperse as easily and readily, or stick as well to the food.
  - It has lost some of its potent powder.
  - If it is a mini component, then feel free to use it.
  - But for pasta, pesto, stir-fry, whole-roasted cloves, you are better off going for fresh garlic.
