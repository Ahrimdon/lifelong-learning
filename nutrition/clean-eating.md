[Reference](https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/nutrition/clean-eating/)

- Eat regularly, several times per day. Don't skip meals, especially breakfast. Make sure you chew thoroughly, at least 25 times for each bite.
- Opt for whole foods whenever possible.
- Include lean protein and carbohydrates as high in fiber as possible in every meal.
- Fats--go for vegetable/olive oils. Less meat, but more veggies, always freshly prepared, if possible.
- Don't drink your calories. Drink at least 2 liters per day.
- Avoid sugar/alcohol.
