## The 4 Hour Chef

- Bobby Flay: "Take risks and you'll get the payoffs. Learn from your mistakes until you succeed. It's that simple."
- "When you have the best and tastiest ingredients, you can cook very simply and the food will be extraordinary because it tastes like what it is. Good cooking is no mystery."
- The Art of Simple Food.
- Why hard to learn?
  - Overabundance of information. Where do you start.
  - Cookbooks are often formatted for the writers.
  - Cooking practice can be expensive.
- Failure points: people put cookbooks down because...?
  - Too many ingredients.
  - Intimidating knife skills.
  - Too many tools, pots, and pans.
  - Food spoilage.
  - Different dishes finishing at different times, leading to cold food.
  - Dishes that require constant tending, stirring, and watching.
- Margin of safety:
  - You can guarantee a good meal by picking the recipes well, not by following recipes well.
- Cook vs chef: someone who can cook is a cook, whereas someone who can create a menu and run a kitchen is a chef.
- Chefs:
  - Trade: burger-flippers.
  - Craft: accomplished chefs. Classic dishes.
  - Art: culinary artists, can entertain, they determine the meal.

### Meta: Meta learning.

- The top 1% often succeed despite how they train. Superior genetics, or a full-time schedule, make up for a lot.
- Career specialists can't externalize what they've internalized. Second nature is hard to teach.
- What you study is more important than how you study.
- Effective: doing the right things. Efficient: doing things right.

- Deconstruction. Minimal learnable units I should be starting with?
- Selection. Which 20% of the blocks should I focus on for 80% or more of the outcomes I want?
- Sequencing. In what order should I learn?
- Stakes. How do I set up stakes and guarantee I follow the program?

- Compression. Can I make the most important 20% a graspable one-pager?
- Frequency. How should I practice?
- Encoding. How do I anchor the new material?

### Deconstruction

- Reducing: How to learn Japanese characters. Each part of the character means something.
- Interviewing: How to shoot a basketball.
  - Example for ultra-running:
    - Who is good at ultra-running despite being poorly built for it? Who's good at this who shouldn't be?
    - Who are the most controversial or unorthodox runners or trainer? Why? What do you think of them?
    - Who are the most impressive lesser-known teachers?
    - What makes you different? Who trained you or influenced you?
    - Have you trained others to do this?
    - What are the biggest mistakes and myths you see in ultra-running training? What are the biggest wastes of time?
    - What are your favorite instructional books or resources on the subject?
    - If you were to train me for four weeks for a competition and had a million dollars on the lines, what would the training look like?
- Reversal: How to build fires.
- Translating: How to dissect the grammar of any language.

### Learning to Taste

- Herbs come from leaves and stems, while spices come from the root, bark, and seeds.
- Smell your food before eating it. This will change how you experience flavor.
- Tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.

### Selection

- Minimal effective dose (MED): consume 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up.
- Five minutes of kettlebell swings, three times per week.
- Slow-cadence lifting.
- Marketing MED: 1000 true fans.

#### The MED of Cooking: Technique over Recipes

- Braising, sauteing, grilling.
  - Steps in braising:
    - Brown the outside of the meat, then remove.
    - Saute carrots, onions, celery in the same pan.
    - Return meat to pan.
    - Add liquid to cover 1/3 to 2/3 of the meat.
  - Lean manufacturing.

### Sequencing

- Looking at things backwards: if you look at the female "follow" lead in tango, you can learn an effective male lead.
- Categorize implicit from explicit. Then meet the greats and ask them questions.
- Explicit expertise (what they told me to do) and implicit expertise (what they just did under pressure).
- Commonalities among best competitors? Which of these aren't actively taught? Which neglected skills could I get good at quickly?

### Stakes

- A goal without real consequences is wishful thinking. You have to put something where your mouth is. Good follow-through doesn't depend on the right intentions. It depends on the right incentives.

### Compression

- Cheat sheets for anything. Making effective decisions, and learning effectively, requires massive elimination and removal of options.
- A task will swell in complexity to fill the time you allot it, a phenomenon referred to as Parkinson's Law.
- One-pager for cooking
  - Probe thermometer to make sure if something is done or not.
  - Steaming: 1/2 inch water in a pot, throw in veggies, cover, leave for 15 minutes on a burner set to high. Vegetables are done when you can slide a fork into them easy.
  - Herb pairings
    - Fish: Fennel or dill.
    - Beef: Rosemary.
    - Pork or lamb: Rosemary.
    - Lamb: Mint.
    - Eggs: Tarragon.
    - Tomatoes: Basil.
- One-page for slow-carb
  - No white starchy carbohydrates.
  - Eat the same few meals over and over again.
  - Don't drink calories.
  - Don't eat fruit.
  - Take one day off per week and go nuts.
- Micro things for cooking:
  - Cold water instead of hot is not because things boil faster or slower, but because it runs through a hot water heater, which can taint the taste.
  - Garlic at the end of a fork to make a makeshift spatula.
  - Salt beans after cooking. If you salt them during cooking, they take longer to cook.
  - Drizzle dressing around the salad, not on the leaves. This prevents the bulk of the dressing from getting stuck on a few leaves.
- Macro things for cooking:
  - Everything must be ready and in its place before you start.
  - Good cooking is about economy of movement.
  - Put staples like olive oil and salt in smaller containers for ease of use.
  - Cooking is prep and pickup.
  - Kitchen towels: one for drying hands (damp) and another for handling hot metal (dry).
  - Grab pan handles from underneath for more control, never from the top.
  - 350F for frying.
  - Nothing wet goes on the cutting boards, use a paper towel to dry off fish, chicken. Moist objects slide.
  - Sear "presentation side" first.
  - 4 minutes per inch.
- Learning by osmosis.
- Memory palace thing.

### 80/20 Pantry

- Extra virgin olive oil, ghee/butter, unrefined virgin coconut oil, grapeseed oil, macadamia nut oil. Check smoking/burning points.
