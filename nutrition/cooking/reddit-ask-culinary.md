## Stocking Up

- Spices: Salt, pepper, ginger, oregano, paprika, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, basil, cumin
- Vegetables: Scallions, onions, garlic, chilli peppers (multiple types), bell peppers, celery, carrots, tomatoes, corn, beans, squash
- Liquids/dairy: Butter, cream, eggs, lemon juice, olive oil, lard, fish sauce, coconut oil, soy sauce, wine

## Basic Kitchen Equipment

#### Utensils

- Wooden spoons
- Heavy duty metal spoons
- Whisks (one for whipping cream/egg whites, one small (optional) for vinaigrettes and smaller batches)
- Heavy duty metal tongs
- Heat resistant silicone spatula
- Slotted spoon (good for retrieving delicate items like poached eggs
- Spider strainer (good for deep frying, blanching)
- Ladle
- Heavy duty sieve (double mesh if possible)
- Colander
- Instant read thermometer
- Silicone brushes for pastries/sauces
- Can opener

#### Cookware

- Frying pan: 10" is enough for 2 people but some prefer 12". 8" is useful for cooking small items, toasting nuts and spices. A small non-stick pan is nice to have for delicate items like eggs or fish.
- Saucepan: A 1.5-2qt and a 3qt are sufficient when starting a collection. Smaller sauce pans are good for heating milk, warming butter, or for sauces. Choose pans with stainless steel lining if possible since it is not reactive like aluminum.
- Dutch oven/saucepot: Dutch ovens are very versatile and can be used for making stocks and sauces, cooking pasta, braising, deep frying, making soups and stews, and baking bread. 5-6qt pot is usually sufficient--most dutch ovens are enameled cast iron which is very durable, has good heat retention/recovery, and is non-reactive thanks to the enamel.
- Cast iron skillet: Cast iron is inexpensive and has the benefit of mass (better heat retention/recovery) which makes it well suited for high-heat applications like searing. Drawback: increased weight and the added process of initially seasoning the pans and keeping them seasoned.

## Kitchen Tips

- Season with salt and pepper from a height (around 8-10") to get even more coverage.
- Don't season just at the end of the cooking process, seasoning from the beginning will help develop more flavor than just at the end.
- When applicable, season a dish with something acidic (vinegar, citrus juices) to help brighten and balance flavors as well as giving it a lighter taste.
- When you can, buy whole chickens and fish and break them down yourself. They are cheaper than buying the prepared pieces and you get the carcass for making stock afterwards.
- If preparing seafood such as prawns, crabs, lobsters, or shellfish, save the shells in a bag in the freezer and then make a seafood stock once you have enough.
- Keep knives sharp and steel them regularly; sharp knives are quicker and easier to work with and are safer as well.
- Use thick-walled/bottomed pans for even more heat distribution.
- Stainless steel-lined pans produce lots of brown bits when searing meats which is good for a pan sauce. Non-stick pans produce basically none.
- Brown meats well with high heat; if the pan isn't hot when you put the meat in, take it back out.
- Dry meats sear best so pat them dry if necessary.
- Rest meals before carving them to allow the juices to redistribute; carving the meat before it has rested will result in the juices running out and leaving it dry.
  - Individual portions (chicken breast, steak, pork chop): 3-4 minutes.
  - Small roast item (pork tenderloin, other small items): 10-15 minutes.
  - Medium roast item (whole chicken): 20-30+ minutes.
  - Large roast items (whole turkey): could be up to 2 hours.
- When carving meat, slice it in thick slices to keep it from going cold quickly.
- After carving, season slices of rare-cooked meats lightly with salt.
- If time allows, let braised meats cook in the cooking liquid to keep them moist.
- Don't discard the trim from good vegetables such as asparagus, the tops of leeks or fennel or the stems of herbs like parsley, coriander, basil, tarragon as they are good for adding to stocks.
- Store fresh herbs wrapped in a moist paper towel in a plastic bag in the fridge.
- Cook mushrooms with high heat to give lots of flavour and season near the end so the water isn't drawn out and they boil in the pan.
- There's nothing wrong with frozen peas and good quality canned whole plum tomatoes.
- If there's a green sprout in the middle of a garlic clove, remove it since it's bitter.
- Season pasta cooking water well with salt to the point where it tastes like the sea. 1 teaspoon of kosher salt per quart of water.
- When cooking pasta use lots of water, keep it boiling, and stir a few times to keep it from sticking together.
- Don't rinse pasta after cooking or the starch that helps the sauce to adhere will get washed off.
- Reserve some of the cooking water after draining the pasts to help thin the sauce if necessary.
- The key to poached eggs is to use the freshest eggs possible and to poach them in acidic water to keep the whites from spreading everywhere.
- The older the egg, the easier it should be to peel when making hard boiled eggs.

## Stock-related Tips

- Don't boil a stock or it will become cloudy; stock should be cooked over a very low simmer such that a few small bubbles come up every so often and the surface gently trembles/quivers.
- Skim the stock frequently to remove the scum and fat.
- Don't use a stock as a dumping ground for all vegetable trimmings; the vegetables/herbs should still be fresh and of good quality.
- Avoid using ingredients like cabbages, broccoli, and other relatives as their flavours are quite aggressive and unpleasant for a neutral stock.
- Fish stock:
  - Use bones and heads of non-oily white fish like halibut, snapper, sole, turbot, etc.
  - If using heads, remove the gills as they can give a bitter flavor.
  - Don't cook fish stock for more than 30 minutes or the bones will start giving a bitter flavor.
  - A slotted spoon is good for skimming the foam/scum from a fish stock.
  - Lots of particles are released into the stock when making a fish stock, so after cooking it, allow it to sit for 10 minutes. After allowing it to rest, gently ladle the stock through an extra fine sieve.
  - Another way to clarify a fish stock well is to strain it then chill it overnight so the particles settle to the bottom. Afterwards, ladle the top/clear stock out, taking care not to agitate and re-suspend the particles.
- Veal stock: Blanch the veal bones (cover in a pot with cold water, bring it to the boil and simmer for 10-15 minutes, then rinse well with water) so the stock doesn't turn a grayish color and get cloudy.
- For beef and veal stocks, some advocate adding a blackened onion to give a darker color and extra flavor.
- If you don't have access to chicken bones or don't have enough to make a stock, you can buy fresh wings instead and still make a good stock.
- Some spices can be added to stocks as well as long as they are not overly assertive in their flavor (e.g. cumin).
