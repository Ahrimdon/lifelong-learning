## What is the difference between pan seared, pan roasted, and pan fried?
[Reference](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-pan-seared-pan-roasted-and-pan-fried)

- Pan searing: The surface of the food is cooked at high temperature until a caramelized crust forms. You can also brown and blacken to sear all sides of a particular piece of meat.
- Pan roasting: High heat searing on the stove top, then lower-temperature finishing in the oven.
- Pan frying: Minimal cooking oil, just enough to lubricate the pan.
- Butter baste/painting: the chef's trick for another flavor layer.
- Pan fry requires a lower heat so that the exterior of the food doesn't overcook until the interior reaches the proper  temperature. Same amount of oil is used for a saute, but the temperature should be lower during a pan fry.

- Flipping the pan is done to move the food. It has nothing to do with faster cooking.
- But to cook something, the product must be heated, and the pan transfers hear directly into the product.
- For woks, those woks are at high heat. Those are designed for fast cooking.
- Shaking and flipping the contents of the frying pan is done not to look cool but for avoiding cross contamination and for speed (as opposed to looking for a spatula). Safety--easier to grip the handle of the pan rather than a spatula. Cleanliness--less tools.

- More fried rice things: The peas don't get cooked as much? I'm not really sure.

- Fried rice: use day-old rice (firm grains will prevent the rice from getting soggy), make sure the wok is very hot (to not steam the rice), not that much add-ins (carrots, peas, onions, scallions). Soy sauce/mirin/fish sauce/sesame oil to season but remember to use them sparingly.

- Baking a potato in the microwave: poke holes in it for the steam to go out.

- Even chicken.
- Lightly salt and pepper.
- Heat pan on high.
- Medium heat, 1 minute on one side.
- Flip other side 1 minute.
- Lid on, 10 minutes, low heat.
- After 10 minutes, lid still on, let it sit.

- Brining pork chop: 4 tbsp salt on 4 cups water, dissolve pork chop inside with aromatics.

- When cooking french toast, do not include crust because it will soggy.

- Keeping eggplants preserved
  - Boil water, add salt, boil an eggplant.
  - Put the eggplant in an ice bath after.
  - Transfer eggplant, and place in the refrigerator.
  - When it's cool, place in the container.
- Waiting for things to boil: a good indication of if it has been cooked or not. Ex: boiling pork + garlic + onion.
- Precooking pork: Just a bit longer than chicken.
- Eggplant can get rotten quickly.
- Butter: Wrap in foil because it will oxidize, foil keeps the oxygen out. You can also
