- Unopened raw ground beef may be refrigerated for 1 to 2 days.
- Bacteria grow rapidly at temperatures between 0 to 60 C, ground beef should be discarded if left out for more than 2 hours at room temperature.
- Properly stored, ground beef will maintain quality for about 3 to 4 months, but will remain safe beyond that time.
- Cooked ground beef will usually stay good for 3-4 days in the fridge and 4 months in the freezer.
- Bad ground beef: sour smell, dull color, slimy texture.

- Ensure meats are wrapped, then store in a container.
- Anything that has been cooked has about 2-3 days in the fridge.
- Raw proteins in the form or large steaks or roasts can last 3-5 days. Ground beef has about a shelf life of 2 days since it has smaller particles.
- Shortest shelf span = fish, best to cook it within 1 to 2 days.
