## Cutting Boards
[Reference](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/17/Cutting-Boards)

- Large cutting boards, as big as your sink. Bigger is better since larger surface area.
- Thickness should be enough for cutting.
- Surface
  - Wood boards = maple or pine. A good, sharp knife will cut into a wood board to some degree,so the cutting surface will look worn.
  - Plastic board = roughened surface to aid in keeping food from slipping off. Bad for knives and easier to clean. Most sharp knives will eventually carve grooves into the plastic surface where stains can form and bacteria can collect.
  - Oil a wood board once every couple of weeks, this protects the board from soaking up too much moisture and cracking or warping. Use mineral oil.
  - Sanding the board: afterwards, wash, dry, and set out for hours to eliminate bacteria that may have been released from the interior wood.
- Grooves: Carved at the edge to catch juices. Cutting boards with large grooves serve better for carving than for cutting. Separate carving board for carving.
- Bacteria
  - Plastic boards have a nonporous surface that provide no place for bacteria, but with time the board will provide plenty of hiding spaces for bacteria to survive even through vigorous washing.
  - Scrubbing with hot water is your best bet when it comes to plastic. You can also pour bleach, diluted in water, over the board to kill all the bacteria.
  - Wood cutting boards actually absorb the bacteria, but when the wood has been cleaned and dried, the bacteria near the surface dies. The wood near the surface is hostile for bacteria , they exist but are below the surface.
- Bamboo: absorbs less liquid than maple wood and are easier to wash.
