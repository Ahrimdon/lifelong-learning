- Remove grease: fill the pan with water and vinegar. As the mixture boils, the oil layer will rise to the top. Remove the oil, wash the pan with warm water and soap with a nylon scrubber, then rinse completely and dry with a soft cloth.
- Remove residue: Water + baking soda, scrub with a nylon scrubber, then wash with soap and water.
- Avoid harsh cleaners or abrasive scrubbers.
- Avoid cooking on high heat.
- If unable to wash a cooled pan right away, fill it with water to keep the residue from drying.
- Do not let other items touch the non-stick areas of the pan during storage--put a cloth or paper towel between the two items to prevent scratches.

- Non-stick pans can be bad news, especially cheap ones. The non-stick coating comes off gradually over time into your food and you end up consuming all sorts of nasty heavy metals and chemicals.
- Never boil water in them and avoid high heat. Try to not use more than a medium heat and never more than medium-high. High heat accelerates the coating separating from the pan and into your food. This will happen no matter what, but we are not trying to speed this process up.
- Avoid using any type of scrubber if at all possible; yes even plastic ones. If you can't use a regular sponge or cloth, let it soak over night. If you have a nice anodized aluminum pan you can just let it sit overnight and the food will dry up and you can wipe it out with a paper towel before washing it.
- Always use wood or plastic implements.
- At the first sign that the coating is coming off, throw the pan out. By the time you notice the coating is coming off, you've already consumed a fair amount. There is no saving the pan. It will continue to shed heavy metals and chemicals into your food at an accelerated rate.
- Look into getting at least one cast iron pan. Once you use that for a while it will become seasoned and be non-stick. Make sure to do your research on how to treat those pans; i.e. no soap, no acidic foods, using salt and oil to scrub it and the like.
- I use stainless steel for everything, including omelettes. I'm just careful when playing it, and make sure to use high heat with a hot pan before putting anything on it.
- Although stainless is good for many things and can indeed be used for eggs you are missing out on one of the best most classic uses for a black steel pan. The finish on stainless steel does not allow for proper seasoning. A well seasoned french black steel pan can be one of the best pans in your arsenal. Many people including myself would consider this the best "non-stick pan" money can buy. Of course you must go through the pains of seasoning it, but it's worth it.
