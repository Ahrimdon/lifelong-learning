- Wash the container. Not water so hot that youâ€™ll burn yourself, but a good crisp summer day hot at least. Rinse it with this hot water before you continue with cleaning it. Also, if the container is heavily coated with grease, wipe it out with a sponge or paper towel.
- If too flimsy to survive without melting in hot water, this container is not meant to be reused (nor is it microwave or dishwasher safe.)
- If your container has scratches in it from a knife, bacteria can get inside the grooves and be difficult to remove.
- Removing stains: leave the container out in the sun, use bleach to lighten the stains (one part bleach, two parts water). When using bleach, wear rubber gloves to avoid harming the skin.
- Oxidizing the stains: denture cleansing tablets or Oxiclean.
- Mineral deposits: remove them with white vinegar.
- Deodorizing: try cleaning it with baking soda. A teaspoon of baking soda with a cup of water. Scrub the container with a kitchen brush or sponger.
- Removing mold from plastic: Read.
