[Reference](http://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/7-caffeine-free-ways-to-boost-your-energy)

- *Eat gum.* People who chewed gum for 15 minutes felt more alert than those who didn't pop a piece. Chewing gum increases heart rate, which increases blood flow to the brain. Mint stimulates nerve fibers, it's kind of like splashing cold water on your face.
- *Whole-grain sweet spot.* White flour gives you a boost, but then a crash so you feel sluggish. Whole grains are better, but don't overdose, they will trigger a surge of serotonin.
- *Lighten up.* Blue light for alertness, red light for sexual energy.
- *Learn something new.* Don't check email, switch tasks. Learn something new. Brush up on something interesting.
- *Plant a garden.* Gardening is fun. Digging in the dirt is especially stimulating, skin-to-skin contact with soil can fight oxidative stress in your body (me: huh?).
- *Favorite song.* Music is energizing, especially if you sing along. This decreases tension nearly as much as a cardio workout.
- *Massage your ears.* Applying pressure to the outer rim of your ear may help invigorate your entire body.

## 8 Weird Reasons You're Tired All the Time
[Reference](http://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/8-weird-reasons-youre-tired-all-the-time)

- *You're dehydrated.* Neurons in your hypothalamus send mood-altering messages to the rest of your brain as an early warning to drink more water.
  - The fix: You should have to pee once every three hours, and your urine should have a light lemonade-colored tint.
- *You're low on B12.* B12 is needed to make red blood cells and keep neurons functioning properly. Deficiency decreases the amount of oxygen your blood can carry through your body.
  - Only animal foods contain B12.
  - The fix: If you have forgetfulness, restless legs, or numbness and tingling, consider B12 deficiency as a potential culprit. Ask your doctor or nutritionist for a blood test of your levels.
- *You're overwhelmed with stress.* Your levels of the stress hormone cortisol run highest in the morning and dip down at night, helping you maintain a normal daily rhythm. But chronic stress throws this pattern out of whack in either direction. If your body remains on constant alert, your cortisol levels may never fall off at night, disrupting your sleep. Or, your adrenal glands may eventually fall behind in cortisol production, leaving you sleepwalking through your morning.
  - The fix: Change your reaction. Mindfulness practices have been shown to ease stress and fatigue in people with chronic medical conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
- *You have hidden heart disease.* Half of the women who had heart attacks said they had trouble sleeping and felt unusually fatigued in the weeks beforehand. Symptoms: Weariness and shortness of breath when you exercise, climb stairs. Blocked arteries or a weak heart reduce blood flow, preventing your muscles and tissues from getting the oxygen they need to function properly.
  - The fix: Visit a doctor.
- *Your iron levels are too low, or too high.* Low iron levels lead to poorly formed red blood cells, but too much iron and your body will use vitamins/minerals/energy to rid your system of the excess.
  - The fix: Iron deficiency strikes vegetarians/vegans, people with digestive diseases or thyroid problems. High levels can run in families or result from taking supplements.
- *You're not working out.* Too much time spent sedentary drains your fuel tank even though you're merely idling.
  - The fix: Start moving if you're sedentary. 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week report less fatigue and more energy/vigor than those who don't.
- *Exercising too much.* Fatigue and trouble sleeping can serve as a sign that you're pushing your body beyond its limits. Workouts also cause a spike in cortisol. If you're not striking the right balance between activity and rest, you can overload your system with physical stress just as you can with emotional or mental pressure.
  - The fix: Try taking a few days of complete rest.
- *You have a urinary tract infection.* Women who have UTIs also report fatigue and a general sense of illness, and the rate increases among those 40 or older.
