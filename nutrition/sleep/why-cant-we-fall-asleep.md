- Temperature changes help your body to synchronize (body temperature falls).
- Melatonin courses through your system--this tells your brain it's time to quiet down.
- 31% sleep fewer than 6 hours per night, and 69% report insufficient sleep.
- Problem is the time when you go to bed.
- Gens can lead to a sleep initiation deficit.
- Sleep hygiene--affected by nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol. We fall asleep faster when we exercise and have regular mealtimes.
- We are surrounded by blue light, light which our circadian systems interpret as daylight.
- Artificial lift can shift our internal clocks by four or even six time zones.

- REM-sleep behavior disorder: there is a paralysis that keeps our bodies in check as we enter REM sleep. Without this, people physically act out their dreams.
- Sleep apnea: when your breathing pauses as you sleep, often for a few seconds but sometimes for a few minutes, before your body briefly jolts awake to restart the process.
- Link between lack of sleep and neurodegenerative diseases/cognitive impairment, which suggests that sleep could be required for cognitive upkeep and function.
- Link between lack of sleep and heart disease suggests that sleep might serve to relieve vascular stress.
- Sleep-depression link: this might help us deal with emotionally stressful or otherwise disruptive events.
- Crucial for memory consolidation.

- If you’re fully rested, sleep inertia dissipates relatively quickly. But, when you’re not, it can last far into the day, with unpleasant and even risky results.
- As schools have pushed their start times earlier and earlier—a trend that first started in the sixties, Owens says—the health effects on students have been severe.
- The ability to make good decisions can suffer, and kids can become more prone to act out and get depressed. In fact, the rise in ADHD diagnoses may, in part, be the result of inadequate sleep: in children, symptoms of sleep deprivation include hyperactivity and impaired interpretation of social cues.
- **If you sleep six hours a night for twelve days-—and that’s about how much many Americans sleep all year round—your cognitive and physical performance becomes virtually indistinguishable from that of someone who has been awake for twenty-four hours straight.**
- Well-rested basketball players performed better than those who followed their schedules.
- Emotional control suffers--we become more impulsive and prone to depression, and our ability to make good decisions plummets.
- Worse at learning, memory, and arithmetic/analytic reasoning.
- BAD!
- We all want to be productive and effective at what we do. But when we try to boost productivity by expanding our waking hours, we aren't doing anyone any favors.
