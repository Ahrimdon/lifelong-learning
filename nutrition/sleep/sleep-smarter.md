## Sleep Smarter: 21 Essential Strategies to Sleep Your Way to a Better Body

- Sleep deprivation: immune system failure, diabetes, cancer, obesity, depression, memory loss.
- Just one night of sleep deprivation can make you as insulin resistant as a person with type 2 diabetes. This translates to aging faster, decreased libido, and storing more body fat than you want to.
- Sleep dep (less than 6 hours per night) is related to an inability to lose weight.
- Fewer than 4 hours of sleep: twice as likely to die prematurely from heart disease.
- Genes are not what directly control our health, appearance, and personality.
- Nutrigenomics: how the food you eat affects your genetic expression.
- Sleep determines the quality of "copies" that your body prints out of you.

### Power Tips

- When you have a big task coming up, pull out a calendar and plan ahead how you can get your ideal number of sleep hours in. If it's important to you, you'll schedule it. Stick to that schedule as well as you can, and know that you will get the work done better and faster if you're more rested.
- Reframe your idea of sleep, instead of it being "something you have to do", see it as a special treat for yourself and love the entire process. *I've got a hot date with sleep tonight, and we are really going to get it on!* Treat yourself to some incredible sleep, you deserve it.
- The body clock is most responsive to sunlight in the early morning, between 6 am and 8:30 am.
- Getting direct sunlight outdoors for at least half an hour has been shown to produce the most benefit. Even rainy weather is better than indoor lighting.
- Use your break time to get sun on your skin. Even on an overcast day, the sun's rays will make their way through and positively influence your hormone function. Take your 10-15 minute breaks outdoors or near a window, or eat your lunch outside.
- Only getting sunlight through a window is not that good, you need UVB which might not permeate the windows.
- Sunglasses inhibit the natural exposure of light you need to assure healthy hormonal secretions and healthy sleep.
- Seasonal affective disorder--a form of depression that tends to occur during the darker winter months. You can have devices like mirrors, visors, etc. to help treat yourself.
- Set an unbreakable caffeine curfew. For most people, that's 2:00 pm.
- You can do caffeine in the morning for a cortisol boost.
- Warm bath 1 1/2 hours to 2 before sleeping. Core temp will rise and then fall around the time you turn in for the night.
- Mattress pads can be used that help regulate your body temperature.
- Cooling of the room is a must, but some people will feel great all night with a fluffy comforter, some with a few bed sheets, and some would feel better using an additional cooling pad.
- Socks. If your hands or feet are too cold, it could be a sign of poor circulation.
- To get the highest-quality possible, you have to get to bed within a few years of it getting dark outside. Somewhere between 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm. By doing this, you are giving yourself a huge hormonal advantage.
- To help reset your sleep cycle, get some sunlight as soon as possible when you wake up. This is going to help boost your natural cortisol levels and fully wake your system up.
- Don't work the night shift. *If you had to get a different job and work normal hours to save the life of someone you love, you'd find a way. You'd always find a way. It's just that we tend to settle and get comfortable in our story unless are backs against the wall and the pain is bad enough. We are the most creative, industrious, resourceful beings on the planet WHEN WE WANT TO BE.*
- Varying sleep cycles (2-3 nights overnight) is just as bad. Better to just have 2 months overnight, 10 months on the natural so the bodies get to be in sync with their natural circadian clocks.
- To make your mornings better and more energetic, set your alarm to coincide with the 90 minute sleep cycles instead of the standard 8 hours of sleep.
- Keep the topical magnesium and apply it right before you sleep.  Anywhere you are sore, in the center of your chest, around your neck and shoulders. Spray it on liberally.
- Mg in your diet: green leafy vegetables, pumpkin/sesame seeds, Brazil nuts.
- Trouble in the GI tract/parasites. Fastest way to do this: stool test.
- House plant.
- Make an agreement to keep office work out of the bedroom.
- Good sleep nutrients and foods for sexual health.
- Remove light inside the bedroom, too. Alarm clocks with blue or white digits.
- Lowering the luminosity of the lights or using different color bulbs is a great idea.
- Himalayan salt lamps?
- Even in the midday sun, no light should be sneaking in unless you want it to.
- Make sure to get in some activity during the first part of the day, regardless.
- Take out a schedule and block off specific appointment times for you to work out.
- The best form of exercise is the one you enjoy.
- Get an accountability partner.
- Sleep also impacts your exercise.
- Lift weights at least 2 days a week.
- Snack close to bedtime: High-fat, low-carb snack.
- Carbs are not inherently bad, it's just the timing of these that make the difference.
- 90 minutes last meal before going to bed.

### Know the Value of Sleep

- Being awake is catabolic (breaks you down), being asleep is anabolic (builds you up).
- After just 24 hours of sleep deprivation, there is an overall reduction of 6% in glucose reaching the brain. *This is why you crave sweets if you are sleep deprived. Your body is trying to compel you to get that glucose back to your brain ASAP.*
- Your parietal lobe and the prefrontal cortex actually lose 12-14 percent of their glucose when you don't sleep.
- When your prefrontal cortex starts to shut down, your brain knows it can find a quick source of glucose and your willpower suffers.
- When you are tired, you are not the best version of yourself. Same with being sleep-deprived.
- Lymphatic system: eliminates metabolic waste and toxins to keep you healthy. *However, this does not include your brain.* The brain has a glymphatic system (g for glial cells).
- Your brain cells are reduced in size by about 60% when you're asleep to make waste removal even more efficient.
- Because your brain is so active while you're awake, it's continuously building up byproducts that are mainly removed by the restorative power of sleep.

### Get More Sunlight During the Day

- Humans have evolved with a predictable pattern of light and darkness that has always controlled out sleep cycles. Your sleep cycle is heavily impacted by the amount of sunlight you receive during the day.
- Circadian rhythm: regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, found in the hypothalamus (this controls your body's hunger, thirst, fatigue, body temperature, and sleep cycles).
- How does morning light improve sleep? Light actually signals your hypothalamus and all corresponding organs and glands to be alert and "wake up."
- *Sunlight exposure triggers your body to produce optimal levels of daytime hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate your biological clock.*
- Serotonin: Feelings of happiness and well-being. Many antidepressant drugs are centered around this.
- 95% of your serotonin is located in the gastrointestinal tract. It is influenced by your diet, your activity level, and it's also influenced by the amount of natural sunlight you get.
- Most of us suffer from the effects of light deprivation.
- *Office workers who didn't have access to windows got 173% less exposure to natural light, and slept an average of 46 minutes less per night..*
- Not only is serotonin rooted in your belly, it is also located in blood platelets, your central nervous system, and even your skin.
- Serotonin and serotonin transporters have been found in human skin cells and are heavily influenced by exposure to sunlight.
- Human skin can produce Serotonin can transform it into  melatonin.

#### Melatonin

- Produced by the pineal gland and other tissues in your body that send you signals to your cells to prepare you for sleep.
- It improves your sleep quality by helping to create the optimal conditions in your body for getting amazing sleep.
- Some researchers believe that melatonin is related to aging. When you sleep smarter, there won't be any dramatic drop-off, and you can sleep like a baby for more years of your life.

#### Cortisol

- Your body produces this for a reason. The goal isn't to have as little cortisol as possible, but to have a healthy rhythm of cortisol production to get you the results you want, when you want them.
- Increase in cortisol in the morning, which is for the purpose of getting up.
- Natural reduction in cortisol as the day goes on, bottoming out in the evening.
- Weird thing: you are supposed to be tired at night but sometimes you are alert, and you are supposed to be alert in the morning, but you feel sleepy.
- Daytime exposure to sunlight is so important that it encourages the production of cortisol. Exposure to sunlight decreased cortisol levels later in the day when compared to being exposed to dim light during the day. By getting more exposure to sunlight, you set the tempo for a normal cortisol rhythm, and a normal melatonin rhythm as well.

### Avoid Screens Before Bedtime

- The artificial blue light produced by computers kick out a sleep-sucking blue spectrum of light that can give you major sleep problems. You will produce more cortisol.
- The use of light-emitting electronic devices in the hours before bedtime can impact overall health, alertness, and the circadian clock that synchronizes the daily rhythm of sleep. Lower secretions of melatonin too.
- When we are addicted to technology, we are hardwired not to the technology, but it's that we are hardwired to continue to seek.
- Dopamine, apparently, is not about pleasure. The pleasure is an end result that we receive from the opioid system. It is a brain chemical about finding out what's coming next.
- The Internet is designed for the seeking brain and dopamine because there's an infinite amount of data you can discover there.
- Eliminating the dopamine transporters in mice (which enabled dopamine to stick around longer in their system) resulted in mice that sleep a lot less.
- Dopamine is tied to motivation and alertness, whereas serotonin is tied to contentment and relaxation.
- Make a mandate to turn off all screens at least 90 minutes before bedtime to allow melatonin and cortisol levels to normalize.
- Before sleeping, you can read books or chat with people.
- One of the most important things you can do is to turn off the cues. Remove automatic notifications.

### Have a Caffeine Curfew

- Caffeine 3 hours or 6 (!) hours before bed showed significant measurable disruptions in their sleep.
- Measurable 1 hour of sleep with 6 hours before, but they didn't know it at first.
- All day when you're awake, neurons in your brain are firing and producing a neurotransmitter by-product known a adenosine. Your nervous system is constantly monitoring for adenosine in your body, because one the levels of it rise to a certain point, your body starts to nudge you to sleep (or at least to relax).
- Caffeine fits into adenosine receptors. *It doesn't actually turn on functions to make you tired. So your brain and body are still trucking along but your brain doesn't realize that you are actually sleepy.*
- So your brain keeps on producing adenosine, but the adenosine never gets properly metabolized. So your body literally has to change the way it normally functions, stress hormones increase, and your brain and organs get overworked because they aren't getting the accurate cues to recover.
- Problem is, with a spike in stress hormone production comes the crash. When you come back to your stress levels before the adrenaline spike, you go below it.
- Caffeine causes vasoconstriction (tightening or narrowing of your blood vessels). When you stop taking it, your body will undergo vasodilation (an instant widening of the blood vessels). Suddenly, where blood flow was once restricted, blood comes rushing in and pushing more freely. This is felt most in the head and neck region and can manifest as a headache on only one side of the head.
- Fixing addiction
  - We changed from coffee to tea.
  - Exercise--some peaceful walks, some yoga, and anything else that wasn't too stressful.
  - Increased water intake a bit and add in a high quality sea salt.
  - Increase in fiber.
  - Accountability of someone cheering her on.
  - The challenge is if people are having more servings of caffeine in a day.

### Be Cool

- Your body temp cycles from 1 degree to 1 degree above the normal temperature.
- Optimum room temperature for sleep: 15-20 C.
- Insomniacs tend to have a significantly warmer body temperature than normal right before bed. When they wore "cooling caps", they slept even faster than people without sleep disorders. They took 13 minutes to fall asleep, compared to 16 minutes for the health control group.
- HPA axis: critical in normal hormone function, sexual function, and managing body weight. Takeaway: This hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is the body's number one system for managing stress.
- Insomniacs experienced greater levels of anticipatory anxiety than normal. Higher levels of worry and stress over sleeping. You need to be cool, too. From work, relationships, nutrition, and exercise, your HPA axis manages it all.

### Get to the Bed at the Right Time

- Most beneficial hormonal secretions/recovery: 10:00pm to 2:00am.
- We are literally designed to sleep a few hours after dark.
- Melatonin, HGH, and more are secreted in their strongest doses when your sleep is lined up properly. The best dose of HGH (youth hormone) is if you're sleeping during those primetime hours.
- This is why some people get 8 hours of sleep bu don't feel well rested when they wake up.
- International Agency for Research on Cancer: "Overnight shift work is a Group 2A carcinogen--working overnight is a strong enough cancer-causing agent to be lumped in with lead exposure and UVA radiation."
- Melatonin: strong antiestrogenic effects (inhibits breast cancer), your body produces this every night if you're getting the sleep you really require.
- Too much estrogen in men: depression of secondary sex characteristics (stunted growth, lack of body hair, higher voice), increase in growth of breast tissue, and cancer.
- *Women who worked the night shift had a 30% greater incidence of breast cancer.*
- Higher incidences of diabetes in shift workers.
- Rate of workplace injury did not go down for night-shift workers in the last 30 years.
- The average life span of physicians is up to 10 years less than the general public in some regions.
- A short sleep debt can be cleaned up by your body with good sleep, good nutrition, and smart exercise to help move things along.

### Fix Your Gut to Fix Your Sleep

- Food is information--the types of food you eat incite processes that determine what your body, health, and sleep will look like.
- Serotonin impacts your brain and sleep more powerfully than almost anything you can think off.
- The human gut is a mass of neural tissue, filled with 30 types of neurotransmitters. This is the enteric nervous system (second nervous system).
- The gut is found to contain at least 400 times more melatonin than the pineal gland in your brain.
- The health of your gut will always have a tremendous impact on the quality of your sleep.
- Things that can damage your gut bacteria:
  - Agricultural chemicals (pesticides, fungicides).
  - Processed foods (excess sugars).
  - Repeated antibiotic use.
  - Chemical food additives and preservatives.
  - Chlorinated water.
- Diet soda: highly processed, it can break your metabolism.
- The body has evolved to recognize the nutrients that it can extract from whole foods. No guarantee that you can process vitamin C from a supplement.
- Nutrients
  - Selenium: Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, beef, oysters, chicken, mushrooms.
  - Vitamin C: Low blood levels of vitamin C were more prone to waking up during the night. Bell peppers, vegetables, kiwi, strawberries, citrus fruits, papayas.
  - Trytophan: Turkey, chicken, eggs, sweet potatoes, chia seeds, hemp seeds, bananas, pumpkin seeds.
  - Potassium: Bananas, leafy greens, potatoes, broccoli, avocados.
  - Calcium: Kale, mustards, sardines, sea veggies, sesame seeds.
  - Vitamin D: Swordfish, salmon, tuna, mackerel, shiitake mushrooms. What you want is Vitamin D3.
  - Omega-3s.
  - Melatonin: Tart cherries, walnuts, ginger root, asparagus.
  - Vitamin B6: Helps modulate your stress response. Bananas, yogurt, cashews, peanut butter, almonds, avocados, fish, tomatoes, spinach, sweet potatoes, sea veggies, eggs.
  - Probiotics: sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, miso, yogurt, kefir.

#### Magnesium

- Magnesium: Balances blood sugar, optimizes circulation and blood pressure, relaxes muscles, reduces pain, and calms the nervous systems. This also tends to get depleted fast.
- 80% US is deficient in magnesium.
- Magnesium can be taken in through the skin. Epsom salt: a form of magnesium called magnesium sulfate.
- Things like magnesium bath flakes and magnesium oils are usually 20% absorbable at best.

### Create a Sleep Sanctuary

- It's hard to change some habits because the brain uses myelin.
- When you step into your bedroom, parts of your brain might light up expecting to watch television. Your brain goes through what it's used to, not what you want it to do.
- Air ionizer/purifier to remove negative ions in the air (oxidize odors, fungi).
- Good idea to have plants in the home/room. English ivy: NASA lists this as the number one air-filtering houseplant.
- Perennial snake plant.
- The sound of water, or improving the air quality, do whatever it takes for you to feel relaxed and comfortable in your sleep sanctuary.

### Have a Big "O"

- Having an orgasm can be like a full-on sedative for most people.
- Oxytocin levels are increased through orgasm, and it has a calming effect that counters the effects of cortisol and helps to promote sleep.
- Sex is another way you can keep up your body's release of this powerful anti-stress neurotransmitter.
- Norepinephrine synthesizes melatonin.
- Vasopressin, prolactin.
- Good sleep also leads to good sex.

### Get It Blacked Out

- The skin has receptors that can pick up light.
- Sleep is not just about covering the eyes, it's about creating a sleep environment that helps bring about the best sleep possible.
- *Sleeping in total darkness is so significant that nighttime light has been dubbed "light pollution."*
- Get the popular "blackout" curtains that are available from most retailers.
- The room should be so dark that you can't see your hands in front of your face.
- Sleeping in total darkness is something that our genes expect us to do. It's not uncommon to have lights of some time beaming in your room all night long.
- Night: Try using the soft light of candles or lamps with red bulbs. Not just about the color of light, but the luminance.

### Train Hard (But Smart)

- When you sleep is when your body releases large amounts of beneficial hormones and repairs you to build you up.
- People who exercised at 7:00 am slept longer and had a deeper sleep cycle than the other two groups.
- Problem with working out in the evening: it raises your core temp and it can take 4-6 hours before it goes down again.
- Good time to exercise at 4:30 pm if you are expecting to sleep at 10:00 pm. By that time the stress hormones from the workout have subsided, the "rest and digest" system has taken over, and your core body temp has dropped down to set the optimal internal environment.
- Big spike of cortisol in the early morning.
- Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest triggers for accelerated loss of your telomere length.
- 100 minutes a week of exercise: telomeres are for 5-6 years younger.
- Best hormonal response: lifting weights.
- Exercise: Makes people fall asleep faster, shorter wake time, higher total sleep time, higher sleep efficiency.
- Consistent exercise.

### Get Your "Friends" Out of Your Room

- Electronic teddy bear.
- Just use an actual alarm clock.

### Lose Weight and Don't Find It Again

- Being overweight causes severe stress to your internal organs and nervous system, and it disrupts your endocrine system like few things can.
- After consuming a meal, overweight people secrete higher levels of cortisol.
- Higher cortisol = higher blood sugar, lower insulin sensitivity, increased levels of inflammation.
- Sleep apnea: Pauses in breathing or infrequent breathing during sleep. As the person gains weight, the risk of sleep-disordered breathing increases due to compromised respiratory function.
- Just have a better ratio of all three macronutrient groups for you and your metabolism.
- Micronutrients: Just eat real food.
- You might still be eating too many calories but have bad nutrition. The body will let you know in the form of hunger that it needs nutrients, you replenish it with bad food, and you are still hungry after.
- *By focusing on eating micronutrient-rich food as the bulk of your diet, you will ensure that your body is producing leptin and filling the nutritional gaps that made you hungry in the first place.*
- Keep insulin down through the first part of the day. Morning is time to get things like a vegetable omelet in.

### Go Easy on The Bottle

- About alcohol. I don't drink anyway.

### Play Your Position

- Maintain the stability of your spine.
- Sleeping on your back: the most accurate. Less likelihood of digestive distress, acid reflux, and allows facial skin to breathe.
- Bad side with sleeping on your back: Higher chance of sleep apnea.
- Bad mattress: Better to be sleeping on the floor. Just make sure your spine is not sinking in.
- Most people report that they prefer to sleep on their side, and for good reason.
- Mattresses should be replaced every 7 years.
- When a mattress is delivered, when they say "let the room air out", it's because mattresses are treated chemically. You can absorb (not just smell) these gases.

### Calm Your Inner Chatter

- Meditation--sitting quietly and focusing on your breathing, or counting your steps as you walk around the park.
- Meditation is an effective treatment for insomnia.
- Beta waves: for wakefulness. Alpha waves: for relaxedness. The ability to change your brain waves is one of the reasons meditation works.
- Fight-or-flight response: reaction to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival.
- Sympathetic nervous system: stressed. Breathing deep is powerful.
- Mindfulness meditation: Be here, now!
- Meditate:
  - Before you go into bed, not while you're in the bed.
  - If you're constantly waking up in the middle of the night, there might be a couple of potential causes.
  - Hormonal imbalance, low blood sugar, problem in the GI tract, psychological stress.
  - Psychological stress results from things we know we "need to do" or haven't let go of.
  - If you are agitated on frustrated, then by all means give yourself permission to get out of bed and journal or read.

### Use Smart Supplementation

- Ideally, you first need to address the lifestyle issues that are actually causing the sleep problem.
- Chamomile: Can be used as a mild sedative and sleep inducer.
- Kava kava.
- Valerian.

### Be Early to Rise

- It's only in the last 100 years that we've overridden the patterns of sleep and wakefulness.
- Our eyesight, sense of smell, and hearing sucks in the darkness.
- The lack of consistency may be one of the biggest issues: the irregular sleeping hours prevent your brain from settling into a pattern, creating a state of perpetual jet lag.
- It's not just how you sleep, but when you sleep, that helps to create the best version of you.
- Early birds are more proactive than evening people.
- To wake up earlier:
  - Get excited. The night before, think of one thing that you'd like to do in the morning that excites you.
  - Jump out of bed. "Yes, I'm alive!"
  - Put your alarm across the room.
- Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning.
- Go to bed within 30 minutes of the same time each night and wake up at the same time each day.

### Use Bodywork That Works

- Test subjects receiving massages experienced improved sleep and an increase in serotonin levels.
- Problem: People drink coffee to charge but don't do the opposite/reverse.
- Book yourself a massage.
- Progressive muscle relaxation: A relaxation exercise in which you systematically tense and then relax all the muscle groups in your body.
- Foam roller? Any self massage things.

### Dress for the Occasion

- Don't wear tight clothes, as they can literally cut off the flow of your lymphatic system.
- Tight socks are bad.
- Women who slept in their bras had a 60% greater risk for developing breast cancer (?).
- If you and your partner both sleep in the nude, you can reap the benefits of oxytocin.

### The 14-Day Sleep Makeover

- Bedtime ritual. Before sleeping, listen to a podcast, talk with someone, meditate, journal, take a bath.
- Get topical magnesium.
- Gratitude log or gratitude journal. What are you excited about for tomorrow?
- Try to get a few minutes of direct sunlight.
- 5 to 10 minutes of exercise.
- Book a massage.
- Alternative lighting for your room: low blue light bulbs, a salt lamp, a lamp with a dimmer, or candles.
- Self-massage or bodywork.
