[Reference](https://tim.blog/2008/01/27/relax-like-a-pro-5-steps-to-hacking-your-sleep/)

- **Consume 150-250 calories of low-glycemic index foods in small quantities prior to bed.** 1-2 teaspoons of flaxseed oil before sleeping.
- Ice baths to provoke sleep.
- Eating meals at set times.
- Caffeine naps. Down an espresso and set your alarm for no more than 20 minutes.
- Make your priority list in the afternoon for the following day to avoid late-night planning, and do not read non-fiction prior to bed. Read fiction that engages the imagination and demands present-state attention.
