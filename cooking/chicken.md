1. Marinating. Season and marinate your chicken for 24 hours before cooking and store it in the refrigerator.
2. Healthy marinating. Marinate chicken in seasoned fruit juice or chicken broth instead of oil-based marinades.
3. Seasoning. Freshly grated lemon peel, minced hot peppers, fresh herbs, and infused vinegars.
4. Non-stick skillets. Use a non-stick skillet to eliminate the need for oil and butter.
5. Cooking thermostat. Drying out chicken by overcooking can ruin its taste. Use a cooking thermometer to determine when the chicken is cooked right.
6. Skin. Keep the skin on to avoid drying out the meat.
7. Brine. Soak it in salt water before cooking. Brine: Half a cup of salt and half a cup of brown sugar in a gallon of water. Brining makes cooked meat moister by hydrating the cells of its muscle tissue before cooking, via osmosis. The brine surrounding the cells has a higher concentration of salt than the fluid within the cells, but the cell fluid has a higher concentration of other solutes.

This leads salt ions to enter the cell via diffusion. The increased salinity of the cell fluid causes the cell to absorb water from the brine via osmosis. The salt introduced into the cell also denatures its proteins. The proteins coagulate, forming a matrix which traps water molecules and holds them during cooking. This prevents the meat from drying out, or dehydrating.

Before cooking the chicken, make sure to rinse off the excess brine with fresh water and dry completely with paper towels.

8. Salt-and-sugar rub. Blend 1/3 cup of salt and 1/3 cup brown sugar with some seasonings (tablespoon of ground black pepper, paprika, and chili powder). In a large resealable plastic bag, rub the entire mixture evenly over the chicken, seal up bag, and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours. When ready to cook, rinse the chicken breasts thoroughly to remove the salt-and-sugar rub and dry the breasts with paper towels.
9. Leftovers. When reheating, cover the dish to retain moisture and flavor. Idea: Wrap sliced chicken breast in pita bread with fresh green peppers, onions, lettuce, pickles, mustard, and ground pepper.
10. Spice it up. For Italian chicken recipes, use fresh minced garlic, dried oregano, dried basil, and dried thyme. For Indian-style chicken, you may want to try mixing coriander, turmeric, cardamom, and bay leaves into a marinate. For Thai chicken, try adding some cilantro, lime juice, ginger, coconut milk, and lemongrass to the recipe. And for that Tex-Mex flavor, try adding cumin, sage, minced fresh chili peppers, or chili powder to chicken.
