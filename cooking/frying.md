[Reference](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/friend-foods-cooking-mistakes/)

- Too oily: Usually, the oil wasn't hot enough. If the oil is cold, the food will just absorb it like a sponge. You want a shimmer but not smoking. You should heat up oil slowly.
- Too soggy: Do not overcrowd the pan or the fryer. When the pan is crowded, heat becomes trapped under the food causing it to steam, rather than fry. Let the oil come back to the correct temperature between batchs of cooking.
- Breading didn't stick to the food: 3 step dredging method (flour, egg, crumbs). Flour does not adhere to wet food.
- Ripping the breading when I turned it: you have to let the food cook for a while, it is ready to turn if you can easily lift it off the pan.
- Black food: heat is too high. Better to have a heavy fan so it conducts heat evenly. Cooking oil that can withstand high temperatures.
- Bland: When you fry food, everything should be seasoned. The tofu, the coating, and after the coating.
