## Reducing Fat in Cooked Ground Beef
[Reference](http://www.beefnutrition.org/CMDocs/BeefNutrition/ReducingFatinCookedGroundBeef.pdf)

- Brown ground beef until no longer pink.
- Microwave 4 cups water in 1-quart glass measuring cup on HIGH 5-6 minutes or until very hot, but not boiling.
- Drain fat from skillet with slotted spoon.
- Pour hot water over beef to rinse fat.
- You can brown beef with onion or garlic during the cooking process. Rinsing the beef after cooking results in minimal flavor loss.
- When making patties, blot them afterwards, both sides.
- Make meat selections last when shopping to ensure the beef stays as cold as possible.
- Bright, cherry-red color indicates fresh ground beef. Darker, purplish-red for vacuum-packaged ground beef since it has not been exposed to air.
- Storage: Refrigerate or freeze ground beef as soon as possible after purchasing. Ground beef can be froze in its original, transparent packaging for up to 2 weeks. 3-4 months if at 0F or lower.
- Wash hands with hot soapy water immediately before and after handling raw beef. Defrost ground beef in the refrigerator, not on the kitchen country to prevent bacterial growth. Cook ground beef as soon as possible after thawing. Cook until no longer pink and the juices show no pink color. Do not eat raw or rare ground beef.
