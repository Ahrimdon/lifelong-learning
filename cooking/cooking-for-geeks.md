## Cooking for Geeks

- The uber-nerd: unafraid to try anything, either "all on or all off", addresses every aspect of the perfect cup of coffee. This kind of geek is always on the search for the next bit of knowledge. If you're this type, this book will inspire you.
- As long as you have "the courage of your convictions" to pick up the spatula, you'll do fine.

## Hello, Kitchen

- A geek today: overly intellectual, obsessed with details, going beyond the point where a mainstream would stop, often to the bemusement of those who don't "get it".
- Hacker: "A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers, and computer networks in particular.
- Random hacks: mug as a plastic bag holder, strainer as a splatter guard, roasting peppers in a toaster, and metal bowl as a double boiler.
- "Duncker's Candle Problem": You don't normally think of the matchbooks cover as a piece of thick cardboard that's been folded over, you just see it as part of the matchbook.
- Think about the end goal: Is cooking for your waist or your wallet?
- To properly respect an animal's life, you need to butcher an animal yourself. For me, cooking is also as much about escaping from work as it is about satisfying hunger, not to mention having fun trying new things with friends and knowing what I'm putting in my body is healthy.
- If your goals are social, then the end state isn't the food on the plate; it's the perceptions that are brought about by the experience of eating.
- You can preheat the plates so that hot food remains hot :)

Types of food, quality of ingredients -> chemical and physical changes -> visual presentation, flavor, texture, temperature -> emotions, memories, associations

### Brian Wansink on Cooking Styles

- The person who purchases and prepares the food in their home controls about 72% of all the food their family eats.
- *Giving cook:* They see the food they make as giving love. Tend to be great bakers, and traditional in their recipes.
- *Health cook:* They will sacrifice taste to make something healthy.
- *Methodical cook:* They can make anything, but they need to have that cookbook in front of them the entire time.
- *Innovative cook:* Seldom uses cookbooks, cooking is a hobby/expressive release.
- *Competitive cook:* They cook to impress other people.
- Eat using a smaller plate. Or serve off the counter. *A person ends up being 2/7 as likely to go back for seconds or thirds if a dish is simply six or more feet away.*
- Bartenders pour more in a short wide glass than a tall skinny glass.

### Nutrition

- Eat the right amount and eat healthy foods. Please restrict processed foods, especially those high in sugar, fats, salt.
- Why do we eat:
  - To provide our bodies with food to break down into energy via catabolism
  - To provide our cells with the necessary building blocks to synthesize the chemicals that cells need to function
- Macros: Protein, fats, carbs. Micros: Trace elements, vitamins.
- Eat too few calories, and your body will either lose weight or slow down your metabolism.
- Fats: you want it to be liquid at room temperature (good: olive oil, canola oil, bad: lard, shortening).
- White four: the wheat germ and bran are removed, but the germ and bran are beneficial to our health.
- The good American diet: "Eat anything, just as long as you're willing to cook it yourself."
- Culinary's biggest division: cooks vs bakers. Cooks: Toss it into the pot. Bakers: precise, exact measurements.
- 1 cup = 256 grams.
- Failure in the kitchen is actually success.

### Recipes

- Recipes: check out different examples.
- Recipes are only a suggestion. They are notes, like a score or script. The oldest recipes are more like tweets rather than a scientific protocol. It wasn't until sometime in the 1800s that cookbooks began to give more precise measurements.
- Maillard reactions?
