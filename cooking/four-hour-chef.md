## The 4 Hour Chef

- Bobby Flay: "Take risks and you'll get the payoffs. Learn from your mistakes until you succeed. It's that simple."
- "When you have the best and tastiest ingredients, you can cook very simply and the food will be extraordinary because it tastes like what it is. Good cooking is no mystery."
- The Art of Simple Food.
- Why hard to learn?
  - Overabundance of information. Where do you start.
  - Cookbooks are often formatted for the writers.
  - Cooking practice can be expensive.
- Failure points: people put cookbooks down because...?
  - Too many ingredients.
  - Intimidating knife skills.
  - Too many tools, pots, and pans.
  - Food spoilage.
  - Different dishes finishing at different times, leading to cold food.
  - Dishes that require constant tending, stirring, and watching.
- Margin of safety:
  - You can guarantee a good meal by picking the recipes well, not by following recipes well.
- Cook vs chef: someone who can cook is a cook, whereas someone who can create a menu and run a kitchen is a chef.
- Chefs:
  - Trade: burger-flippers.
  - Craft: accomplished chefs. Classic dishes.
  - Art: culinary artists, can entertain, they determine the meal.

### Meta: Meta learning.

- The top 1% often succeed despite how they train. Superior genetics, or a full-time schedule, make up for a lot.
- Career specialists can't externalize what they've internalized. Second nature is hard to teach.
- What you study is more important than how you study.
- Effective: doing the right things. Efficient: doing things right.

- Deconstruction. Minimal learnable units I should be starting with?
- Selection. Which 20% of the blocks should I focus on for 80% or more of the outcomes I want?
- Sequencing. In what order should I learn?
- Stakes. How do I set up stakes and guarantee I follow the program?

- Compression. Can I make the most important 20% a graspable one-pager?
- Frequency. How should I practice?
- Encoding. How do I anchor the new material?

### Deconstruction

- Reducing: How to learn Japanese characters. Each part of the character means something.
- Interviewing: How to shoot a basketball.
  - Example for ultra-running:
    - Who is good at ultra-running despite being poorly built for it? Who's good at this who shouldn't be?
    - Who are the most controversial or unorthodox runners or trainer? Why? What do you think of them?
    - Who are the most impressive lesser-known teachers?
    - What makes you different? Who trained you or influenced you?
    - Have you trained others to do this?
    - What are the biggest mistakes and myths you see in ultra-running training? What are the biggest wastes of time?
    - What are your favorite instructional books or resources on the subject?
    - If you were to train me for four weeks for a competition and had a million dollars on the lines, what would the training look like?
- Reversal: How to build fires.
- Translating: How to dissect the grammar of any language.

### Learning to Taste

- Herbs come from leaves and stems, while spices come from the root, bark, and seeds.
- Smell your food before eating it. This will change how you experience flavor.
- Tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.
- Sensations: astringency (cotton-mouth), hotness.
- Herbs:
  - Rosemary
  - Smoked paprika
