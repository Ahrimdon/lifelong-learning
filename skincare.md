- Aim to use a product over at least 6 weeks, once or twice daily, to notice a difference.
- Cleanser, toner, serum, then moisturizer.
- Wash twice a day, morning and night, to avoid clogged pores, dullness, and acne.
- Non-comedogenic: doesn't clog pores or trigger acne. Comedogenic: coconut oil and cocoa butter.
- Toner: they deliver an extra shot of nutrients, helping the other products in your regimen absorb better, while still balancing your complexion.
  - After cleansing and before putting on anything else.
  - Alpha and beta hydroxy acids to remove dead skin cells that clog pores.
  - Hyaluronic acid to boost hydration, seal in dewiness and plump skin to subtly treat fine lines.
  - Rose water and green tea to calm irritation and reduce redness with an anti-inflammatory effect.
  - Vitamin E and C to fight daily exposure to free radicals that can age your skin.
- Serums: these can mitigate a number of issues, from dark spots to wrinkles.
  - Hyaluronic acid to seal in hydration.
  - Vitamin C to help brighten dull skin.
  - Retinol, vitamin B3, peptides to stimulate production of collagen and elastin.
  - Colloidal sulfur, niacinamide to calm redness and irritation by decreasing inflammation, and improve acne with its antimicrobial effects.
  - Don't try mixing a serum into your moisturizer.
- Moisturizing: to hydrate and soften the skin. They assist in preventing water loss through the outer layers of skin.
  - Skin loses the ability to retain moisture as we age.
  - Day/night cream: creams you apply in the morning are equipped to protect your skin from the environmental aggressors you'll face when you leave the house.
  - Night cream: focuses on repairing any damage you might have picked up with ingredients like retinol.
- Eye creams
  - For hyperpigmentation, dryness, or puffiness. More likely to react to irritating ingredients than other areas.
- Sunscreen: hands down the most crucial skin-care product. Daily sunscreen use can help to prevent the formation of certain skin cancers.
- 30 minutes before sun exposure, and reapply at least every 2 hours. Chemical blockers directly to clean skin, while physical blockers can be applied last in your skin-care regimen, but before makeup is applied.
- Face mask? Not essential, but boosters.
  - Sheet mask: Primarily hydrating.
  - Sleeping packs/overnight masks: will have a thicker texture/help trap in whatever ingredients you layer underneath.
  - Clay/mud mask: absorb oil and can have a mild exfoliating effect so great for oily areas.
- Tools:
  - Washcloth: 100% cotton, clean. Use a fresh cloth every day.
  - Sonic cleansing?
  - LED light therapy
  - Microcurrent waves
  - Fractional non-ablative laser.
- Face oil: TLDR.
