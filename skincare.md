- Check skin type.
- Patch test each new product.
- Don't add multiple products at once.
- **Skincare products are gender neutral, men and women have similar skin needs.**

- Cleanse. At least once a day, in the PM. If your skin is more oily, use a cleanser in the AM as well. Your skin is not supposed to feel dry or tight after cleansing.
- Exfoliation: harsh scrubs that physically remove dead skin? Chemical to physical exfoliation. This gets rid of dead skin and cleans up dirty pores. Skin tone, battling acne, and getting rid of close comedones.
  - Start at around 2 times a week and slowly build up the frequency.
  - If you're going to use an AHA, you need to add sun protection into your routine first.
  - Chemical exfoliation: start at a low percentage product and work your way up.
- Spot treat.
