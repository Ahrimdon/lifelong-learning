- Cleanse: This is quick anyway.
- Exfoliate: Excess dead skin cells cause blocked pores, which cause pimples, blackheads etc. Must use at least once a week.
- Toner: Bring your pH back to the neutral. Nowadays, they remove makeup and cleanser residue. Avoid alcohol toners.
- Moisturize. Kiehl's.
- Protection.

- Aim to use a product over at least 6 weeks, once or twice daily, to notice a difference.
- Cleanser, toner, serum, then moisturizer.
- Wash twice a day, morning and night, to avoid clogged pores, dullness, and acne.
- Non-comedogenic: doesn't clog pores or trigger acne. Comedogenic: coconut oil and cocoa butter.
- Toner: they deliver an extra shot of nutrients, helping the other products in your regimen absorb better, while still balancing your complexion.
  - After cleansing and before putting on anything else.
  - Alpha and beta hydroxy acids to remove dead skin cells that clog pores.
  - Hyaluronic acid to boost hydration, seal in dewiness and plump skin to subtly treat fine lines.
  - Rose water and green tea to calm irritation and reduce redness with an anti-inflammatory effect.
  - Vitamin E and C to fight daily exposure to free radicals that can age your skin.
- Serums: these can mitigate a number of issues, from dark spots to wrinkles.
  - Hyaluronic acid to seal in hydration.
  - Vitamin C to help brighten dull skin.
  - Retinol, vitamin B3, peptides to stimulate production of collagen and elastin.
  - Colloidal sulfur, niacinamide to calm redness and irritation by decreasing inflammation, and improve acne with its antimicrobial effects.
  - Don't try mixing a serum into your moisturizer.
- Moisturizing: to hydrate and soften the skin. They assist in preventing water loss through the outer layers of skin.
  - Skin loses the ability to retain moisture as we age.
  - Day/night cream: creams you apply in the morning are equipped to protect your skin from the environmental aggressors you'll face when you leave the house.
  - Night cream: focuses on repairing any damage you might have picked up with ingredients like retinol.
- Eye creams
  - For hyperpigmentation, dryness, or puffiness. More likely to react to irritating ingredients than other areas.
- Sunscreen: hands down the most crucial skin-care product. Daily sunscreen use can help to prevent the formation of certain skin cancers.
- 30 minutes before sun exposure, and reapply at least every 2 hours. Chemical blockers directly to clean skin, while physical blockers can be applied last in your skin-care regimen, but before makeup is applied.
- Face mask? Not essential, but boosters.
  - Sheet mask: Primarily hydrating.
  - Sleeping packs/overnight masks: will have a thicker texture/help trap in whatever ingredients you layer underneath.
  - Clay/mud mask: absorb oil and can have a mild exfoliating effect so great for oily areas.
- Tools:
  - Washcloth: 100% cotton, clean. Use a fresh cloth every day.
  - Sonic cleansing?
  - LED light therapy
  - Microcurrent waves
  - Fractional non-ablative laser.
- Face oil: TLDR.

- Check skin type.
- Patch test each new product.
- Don't add multiple products at once.
- **Skincare products are gender neutral, men and women have similar skin needs.**

- Cleanse. At least once a day, in the PM. If your skin is more oily, use a cleanser in the AM as well. Your skin is not supposed to feel dry or tight after cleansing.
- Exfoliation: harsh scrubs that physically remove dead skin? Chemical to physical exfoliation. This gets rid of dead skin and cleans up dirty pores. Skin tone, battling acne, and getting rid of close comedones.
  - Start at around 2 times a week and slowly build up the frequency.
  - If you're going to use an AHA, you need to add sun protection into your routine first.
  - Chemical exfoliation: start at a low percentage product and work your way up.
- Spot treat.
