### [James Flynn: Why our IQ levels are higher than our grandparents](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vpqilhW9uI)

* We don't just get more questions right in IQ tests, but we get higher IQ test results every generation.
* If you score the people a century ago against modern norms they would have average IQ of __70__ and if you score us against their terms we would have an average IQ of __over 130__.
* Soldiers didn't necessarily have better aim, but they had better weapons (so it looked like they were better at aiming, wherein they just had a gun with a higher rate of fire).
* Lauria: Found out that people were resistant to deducing the hypothetical, and that people didn't deal that well with abstractions. (In 1900 there was just about 4 years of schooling in Russia).
* Classification, using logic on abstractions, and taking the hypothetical seriously: how big is this effect on thinking? One, nearly everyone has an education with a scientific background, and you can't have do science without classificatio and logic and hypothesizing.
* 1900: 3% of Americans practiced professions which are cognitively demanding (lawyers, doctors). Now, 35% (add engineers and programmers) have cognitively demanding professions. The professions have also been upgraded: compare 1900 doctors with the doctors today, or 1900 bankers with the bankers today.
* Moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously. When people came home from wherever during the Civil Rights Movement, they asked parents or racists "what would you do if you woke up black", and these people would just say "that's the stupidest idea ever". They did not take the hypothetical seriously, and __without the hypothetical it is very difficult to get arguments off the ground__. Some people are just not wiling to take the hypothetical seriously.
* Ex: if a super islamist person was sodomized, for him the phrase "what if you were sodomized" doesn't register ("That's not in the Koran").
* The gains in IQ scores have specific areas with large gains (classification, analogies).
* We don't have progress on all fronts. Sadly, you can have humane moral principles, but if you're ignorant of history and other countries then you can't do shit about history. Kids today just live in the bubble in the present. Ex: how would Americans feel if they knew that Americans have invaded Afghanistan 5 times already, and that Americans had been deceived to go to war the last 5 times (such as the sinking of the _Maine_ and that Saddam hated Al-Qaeda).

### [Russell Foster: Why do we sleep?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWULB9Aoopc)

* 36% of your life = spent sleeping. So sleep, at some level, is simportant.
* Literature about sleep has changed throughout history from sleep is awesome to sleep sucks ("money never sleeps").
* Now, we treat sleep as an enemy. Why? We think that we aren't doing anything when we are sleeping.

#### But Why?

* _Restoration:_ The stuff we burn during the day, we restore during the night. Within the brain, there are some genes that are turned on during sleep and these are associated with restoration.
* _Energy concentration:_ The energy saved when sleeping = 100 calories per night (assuming that the person didn't do much when awake). Not that efficient.
* _Learning and memory consolidation:_ The ability to solve problems are enhanced threefold by a good night's sleep. The synaptic connections are strengthened when sleeping.
* Most probably, we sleep for multiple reasons.

### Sleep Deprivation

* 1950s: 8 hours. 2013: 5-6.5 hours. Not enough! The body clock does not change when you work in shifts. Day sleep is not healthy!
* An estimated 31% of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and in the US this is a 100K accidents on the freeway associated with tiredness.
* Alchol: It doesn't make you sleep, it just mimics sleep and sedates you. Don't use it as a long-term solution.
* Weight gain: If you sleep five hours or less, you have 50% chance to be more obese because the hunger hormone is released and it gets the brain to ask for more carbohydrates.
* Stress: Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity (tired people = higher infection, people with shift work = higher risk of cancer), increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease.

#### Am I getting enough sleep?

* If you need an alarm clock, if you need stimulants, if you are grumpy, if your colleagues say you are tired, __then you probably are__.
* Make your bedroom as dark as it possibly can, and slightly cold. Decrease light exposure. Turn off phones, computers. Don't drink caffeine before sleeping.
* Do the things that you know will help you sleep.

#### Myths

* Not everyone needs 8 hours a day, it depends on the people.
* Old people do not need less sleep.
* __Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man wealthy and wise.__ That's just plain wrong, there is no evidence that sleep time is correlated to socio-economic status.

### Sleep Disruption

* In severe mental illnesses, there is alwasy sleep disruption.
* Schizophrenic individuals were awake at night and sleeping during the day. Some of them had no ability to regulate their sleep.
* Mental illness and sleep are not just associated but are physically linked in the brain.
* Sleep disruption actually preceeds certain types of mental illness (ex: bipolar people already have sleep disruption before being diagnosed for bein bipolar).
* Just take sleep seriously!
