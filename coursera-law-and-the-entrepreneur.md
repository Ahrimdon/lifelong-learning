# 2.1: Introduction to Law and the Entrepreneur

* Once you start signing contracts and hiring employees, that’s when you can get a lawyer. Personality fit is also very important.
* Ents want to move full speed ahead, and lawyers will show potential problems and paths against the roadblocks.
* A successful startup needs a team of different people. It’s good to have wise counseling and good advice.
* Ent: Jack/Sydney, “box of the month” subscription service.

# 2.2-2.5: Employment Prior

* Even if a person hasn’t signed a contract, the employee has fiduciary duties (must do stuff, must not compete). 
* Whether an employee is a key or a skilled employee has something there. Check if your business is something that will fight your old job.
* If an employee has signed an agreement (moonlighting provision) then they can’t do shit yet. Also check if the employee has a non-compete agreement. Ex: California, they don’t enforce NCA that much.
* NCA has to be: cannot stand alone (another contract such as employment is needed), actually hurts the employer/not just to stop competition, reasonably limited geographically, scope.
* Sometimes this is non-enforcable, and sometimes NCA is an emotional reaction by the employer, so leave on good terms.

## IP

* The question of ownership can destroy companies before they lift off!
* _Invention Assignment Agreement:_ This tells the company that what they employee creates is owned by the employer. In CA/IL, you can keep shit done on your own time.
* Sometimes, by default your stuff is owned by your employer. So make sure that you don’t do something that your employer does, or when you are working in the company itself.
* Just make sure you keep a log that the shit you do on your own time is by yourself.
* Strategies for Leaving Your Employer: When an employer feels insulted by the employee, he may burn bridges lol. Mention shit in the exit interview, who knows you might even get an investment from your former lawyer.

# Readings: Leaving Your Employer

* _No-moonlighting clause:_ Employee is prevented from engaging in any business activities unrelated to the employee’s job with the employer.
* _Non-disclosure agreement:_ Prohibits the entrepreneur from using or disclosing any of the employer’s trade secrets such as a customer list unless the employer authorizes it.
* _Covenant not to compete:_ Agreement to not compete with the former employer for some period of time after leaving the employer.
* Restriction on recruiting your former coworkers.
* Unskilled employees: their work is generally confined to the period of time where they are actually working.
* Activity on the new business must be after-hours: it’s hard to define this because some employees such as software engineers have weird work hours.

_Ex: Before leaving Apple, Jobs chose five employees who would be joining him at NeXT. Apple sued him for breach of his fiduciary responsibilities but later settled for the condition that NeXT would not hire Apple employees for a six-month period and would not solicit Apple employees for a year and for Apple to inspect NeXT’s products before they were marketed._
 
* An entrepreneur may want to hire away a coworker who has access to the company’s confidential information or who has developed special expertise that could be of great value to the new business. But in doing so, the co-worker violates the NDA or a covenant of not to compete. So employees are asked to sign an agreement expressly prohibiting them from soliciting coworkers: no-raid or antipiracy clause.
* The employer can then sue or actually prevent the co-worker from working with the ent. 
* Key employees are even more restricted in how they may approach coworkers. Even in the absence of a no-raid clause, a key employee is liable for breach of fiduciary duty if the inducement is willfully kept from the employer.

## Covenant Not to Compete

* A _Covenant Not to Complete_ is an agreeement between an employer and an employee that is designed to protect the employer from potentially unfair competition from a former employee.
* Generally 1 year is enough.
* Some states like CA prevent covenants restraining anyone from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business.
* Consent to personal jurisdiction: An agreement to litigate a dispute in a specifically named jurisdication (because people move from state to state for work).
* Remedies for breaching the noncompete clause: injunction requiring the employee to actually stop competing against the former employer, or actual payment of damages.

## Trade Secrets

* Unauthorized use or disclosure of the employer’s trade secrets Is generally prohibited both during and after employment. Most states have passed statutes that prohibit the employee from disclosing or using trade secrets belonging to the former employer even in the absence of a confidentiality agreement.
* A _trade secret_ is information used in one’s business that is neither generally known nor readily ascertainable in the industry and that provides the business owner a competitive advantage over competitors who do not have access to this information.
* This can be: a formula, pattern, program, device, method, technique, process, or customer list.
* Factors: The value of the information to the business owner and competitors and the amount of effort made to maintain the secrecy of the information.
* Inevitable disclosure doctrine: you can’t work for a competitor firm for a limited period of time if the former employer is able to prove that the new employent will lead him to rely on the former employer’s trade secrets.

## Invention Assignment Agreements

* All inventions conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by the employee is assigned to the employer.
* CA: this is prohibited if the emp develops entirely in their free time without using employer equipment and not related to the employer’s biz.
Strategies for Leaving
* Just be honest about the real reasons for leaving.
* Offer the employer an opportunity to invest in the new venture. (Goodwill)

# 3.1: Partnerships

* Any time 2 or more people come together, it’s a general partnership.
* The liabilities are a problem because a partner has to pay liability at one point even if one is broke.
* In a partnership, any partner can make a deal outside the partnership. Unless it is in writing, everyone gets an equal part of the company.
* As with a sole prop, everyone has to pay taxes.

# 3.2: C-Corporations and S-Corporations

* A _corporation_ is a separate legal entity from the owners. Instead of a partnership where two people run a business, two people are members of a corporation who runs a business.
* The board makes decisions for the company.
* _LLC (limited liability company):_ If the corp can’t pay its debts as they become due, the shareholders are not personally responsible. Exceptions are when the shareholder guarantees payment of liability, or if someone is injured.
* When you sign contracts, sign it in the name of the business.
* When you want to set the corp up, you need to file a _Certificate of Incorporation_ with the secretary of state of the state where you file your certificate.
* Units of incorporation: shares of stock. Common stock = everyone. Preferred stock = usually for the VCs,  has special economics and voting rights.
* Basic governance is included in a document called the _bylaws_.
* Taxes: Every corporation when it is formed is a _C-corporation_, which means it is required to pay taxes to the government. If it wants to give to the shareholders, it declares a dividend, and the shareholders pay taxes when they receive the money _(double taxation)_.
* To avoid double taxation, a corporation can declare itself as an _S-corporation_. The tax is paid by the shareholders only. Limitations: maximum 100 shareholders, must be US resident, only individuals can hold, no preferred stock.

# 3.3: Selecting an Entity: Limited Liability Company (LLC)

* LLCs are considered to be separate entity too.
* LLCs are more flexible: it could have a formal board, or it could not have.
* The LLC agreement: what the LLC does.
* Voting can be structured separately from the economics of the business, ex: you can be equal owners but have different powers over voting.
* LLCs are formed by filing a document called the Certifcate of Formation. The Cert is basic and the equity types are not included. These are included in the Operating Agreement. The OA contains the rules.
* LLCs can choose to be C-corp, S-corp, or partnership.
* Each states has its own partnership, corp, and LLC law.

# 3.4: Founders’ Agreements

* _This is REALLY IMPORTANT! Even though it is probably awkward and boring, it has to be done._
* Management: Who will be on the board of directors? What percentages would be present?
* This is important for settling deadlocks in the future. When there is a deadlock and there is no agreement on how to break the deadlock, usually someone else or an expert can make the decision.
* It’s more common to put an _absolute prohibition_, or a _right of first refusal_ (owners can choose to buy shares first before another one). Right of co-sale: _“If you find someone to buy your shares, I get to include a part of my shares in that sale.”_
* Sometimes a majority owner feel that if they want to sell the company then the minority shareholders will hold up the deal. A _drag-along provision_ says that only about 80% or something of shareholders have to agree, and these terms will be used.
 
# Readings 3

## Sole Proprietorship

* A _sole proprietorship_ is a business owned by one person. It has little legal significance separate from its owner and usually requires no governmental filing except under a fictitious-business-name statement (name, address).
	* The owner reports the income and expenses of the business on a schedule to his or her own personal income tax return.
	* Most common in the US.
	* Poor choice because the owner has unlimited liability for the losses of the business, putting their asssets at risk.

## Corporations

Most large business organizations operate as corporations despite tax incentives to use partnerships.

A _corporation_ is a distinct legal entity owned by its shareholders.

This can be owned by a single person (he is also the director.)

Required officers: president, treasure, and secretary. They are appointed by the board and carry out the day-to-day management.

The shareholders elect the corporation's board of directors.

A corporation has unlimited life: shares are transferred upon a shareholder's death to the shareholder's heirs.

### Primary advantages: 

* _Limited liability as it provides to its shareholders:_ creditors are limited to the assets of the corporation for payment and may not collect directly from shareholders if corporate assets are insufficient to pay all debts and liabilities.
* More familiar (for lawyers, VC)
* Permanent
* Able to transfer corporate stock more easily
* VC is unable to invest in partnerships and LLCs because their major investors are pension and profit-sharing trusts

### Taxation

Unless a corporation elects to be taxed as an _S corporation_, it is taxed as a separate legal entity.

Non-S corporations are called C corporations because they are taxed under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.

Under federal income tax laws in effect on January 1, 2011, a corporation is taxed on its net income at rates from 15-35% (34% on income from $75K-$10M).

Property contributed to a corporation will be subject to tax unless that person contributing the property owns at least 80% of the corporation.

Money distributed by a corporation to its sharedholders is subject to tax again when distributed in the form of dividends; shareholders pay that tax.

### Preserving Limited Liability

Under the _alter ego doctrine_, a court may disregard the corporate entity and hold the shareholders personally responsible for the corp's obligations.

When determining whether to _pierce the corporate veil_, there are several factors:

* Was the corporation undercapitalized, given the risks inherent in its business?
* Were corporate assets used for personal reasons?
* Were corporate assets commingled with personal assets?
* Were the corporate and personal books kept separately?
* Were corporate actions properly authorized by the board of directors or the shareholders?

To preserve limited liability, the corporation should observe at least the following procedures:

* Obtain and record shareholder and board authorization for corporate actions.
* Keep corporate funds separate from personal funds.
* Maintain complete and proper records fro the corporation separate from personal records.
* Make clear in all contracs with others that they are dealing with the corporation.
* Maintain an arms-length relationship between the corporation and any principal shareholder.
* Start the business with sufficient equity and liability insurance to take care of the inherent risks.

## S Corporations

An _S corporation's_ shareholders can operate it without being taxed as individuals. So they don't pay federal income tax but pass the tax liability for their profits through to their shareholders.

So profits earned by an S corp will be taxed only once. An S corp's losses flow through to the shareholders and may be deducted by the shareholders on their individual tax returns (subject to limitations).

Profits and losses must be allocated based on share ownership for tax purposes.

In non-S corps, a distribution of earnings is taxed twiced: once when the C corp pays federal corporate income tax on profits when earned, and when shareholders dividends are subject to tax. _An S corp is the same as any other corporation except for the way it is taxed._

Shareholders elect S corp status when the corp is profitable and distributes all of its profits to the shareholders, or when the corporation incurs losses and the shareholders wish to use the loss deductions on their personal income tax retursn.

The case for S corp is weaker when the corp is owned solely by insiders who wokr for the company and receive their share of profits in the form of salary and bonuses, which are deductible as expenses.

Outsiders do not receive their share of the profits in the form of deductible salary and bonuses, so when there are a lot of outsiders, S corps are compelling.

### Requirements

* The corp must have no more than 100 shareholders.
* All of the shareholders are individuals, certain tax-exempt organizations, qualifying trusts, or estates. (This prevents the business from raising equity capital from VCs.)
* No non-resident aliens.
* Only one class of stock (although options and differences in voting rights are generally permitted). (This prevents it from having some kind of founder stock).

### Common stock vs preferred stock

Common stock is issued at a price less than that of the preferred stock because it lacks te liquidation, dividend, voting, and other preferences that the preferred stock possesses.

Because an S corp can issue only common stock, it must issue the stock to employees at the same price paid by the investors (unless sold to the founders well in advance of the sale to the investors) if the employees are to avoid being taxed on receipt of their shares.

## Partnerships

A _partnership_ is a business carried on by at least 2 persons. It is generally treated as a distinct _legal_ entity separate from its partners.

For some purposes, a partnership is treated as an aggregate of its individual partners: it will dissolve on the death of any partner unless the remaining partners elect to continue the partnership.

### Types

* In a _general partnership_, each partner is a general partner, and has unlimited liability for the debts of the partnership. __Each has the power to incur obligations on behalf of the partnership within the cope of the partnership's business.__ Each general partner acts as an agent for the partnership.
* A _limited partnership_ has one or more general partners (each of whom has the same liability and power as a general partners in a general partnership) and one or more limited partners. The limited partners liability is limited to the amount of their capital commitment.
* A _limited liability partnership_ is a hybrid: each partner can participate actively in the business and has unlimited personal liability for his own actions, but is liable for the misdeeds of other partners only to the extent of the partnership's assets.

### Partnership Agreements and Mechanics

The partners may generally establish their own business arrangements among themselves by writing a _written partnership agreement_.

Unlike a corp, a partnership will dissolve on the death or withdrawa of a general partner unless the remaining partners elect to continue the partnership. However, a partnership agreement can, and should, provide for alternatives to liquidation after dissolution (ex of agreement: buyout, new partner, continuation).

In a limited partnership, the death of a limited partner does not result in the liquidation of the partnership; the limited partnership interest can be passed on to the deceased limited partners' heirs.

Few formalities: a general partnership does not even require a written agreement.

A limited partnership must have a written partnership agreement and file a certificate with the applicable secretary of states.

__In the absence of a written agreement, state partnership laws will govern the partnership.__ Some provisions of the laws may lead to unfavorable results. For example, state laws may require partners to share the profits and losses equally regardless of their original capital contributions.

As a practical matter, brcause a partnership is largely governed by the partnership agreement, which will vary with each partnership, more expense is involved in forming a partnership than a corporation because a corporations's governance is controlled by statutes. Avoid standard or _boilerplate_ forms because they are not tailored to the particulars of the partners' relationship.

### Tax Treatment

__A partnership does not pay income tax.__ Income or losses flow through to each partner and are reported on the partner's individual tax returns. A partnership can allocate income and loss flexibly.

Property can be contributed to and distributed from a partnership without being subjected to tax.

A partnership can be converted to a corporation without tax if the incorporation is properly structured. Once a partnership converts to a corporation, however, and distribution from the corporation will be subject to two levels of tax: corporate and shareholder.

Sources of capital are generally restricted to capital contributed by partners and funds loaned by partners and outsiders. It is uncommon for a partnership to raise capital in a public offering, because publicly traded partnerships are taxed as corporations. Most VCs have tax-exempt investors who would receive disadvantaged tax treatment if the fund invested in a partnership. __If you expect to attract capital from a VC, do not organize as a partnership.__

Foreigners participating as a partners would cause them to be treated as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business. So the U.S. would tax any of their U.S. income connected with the trade or business, and the foreign investors would have to file U.S. tax returns. Foreigners generally do not pay tax on income from U.S. corporations in which they invest.

## LLC

The _limited liability company_ has rapidly gained popularity in the United States. A properly structured LLC combines the pass-through federal tax treatment of a partnership with the liability protections of a corporation.

So an organization that is like a partnership but will become and S corp if given the chance will derive the most benefit from organizing as an LLC because: __it will have limited liability protection while retaining favorable partnership tax treatment__.

The owners (members) of an LLC have no personal liability for the obligations of the LLC. For all practical purposes, an LLC operates as a limited partnership without the legal reqirement of having a general partner who bears ultimate liability for the obligations of the partnership.

Unlike a partnership, an LLC can be formed with only one owner.

It also does not have the limitations of an S corp in terms of ownership (must be individuals, 100, etc.) and in terms of stock restrictions.

### Charter Documents

* A short (1-2 pages) document filed with the secretary of state, which sets forth the name of the LLC, its address, its agent for service of process, the term, and whether the LLC will be governed by the members or by the managers appointed by the members. This document is called the _certificate of formation_ (Delaware) or _articles of organization_ (California).
* _Operating agreement_: Analogous to a partnership agreement. The operating agreement specifies how the LLC will be governed; financial obligations of the members, how profits, losses, and distributions will be shared. (Avoid boilerplates!)

An LLC is not suitable for businesses financed by venture capital funds because of tax restrictions on the funds tax-exempt partners. An LLC can be attractive for businesses financed by corporate investors and by wealthy individuals

An LLC is the entity of choice for a startup seeking to flow through losses to its investors because (1) an LLC offers the same complete liability protection to all its members as does a corporation; (2) an LLC can have corporations and partnerships as members (unlike an S corporation), (3) losses can be specially allocated to the cash investors, and (4) it can be incorporated tax-free at any time.

## Selecting a C Corp, S Corp, Partnership, or LLC

### Critical Issues

* Who will be the owners of the business?
* How will the earnings of the business be returned to its owners?
* Is the business expected initially to generate profits or losses?

### Who will be the owners?

If the business will be widely held, so much so that it will be publicly traded, then C corp. Investors are more receptive to offerings of corporate stock than partnership or LLC interests because they are easier to understand.

If the owner interests in the business will be provided to employees, then C corp. 

* Stock ownership is __easier to explain__ than employees than equity interests in partnerships and LLCs. 
* __Creating favorably priced equity incentives is easiest to accomplish__ in a C corp because of the different classes of stock: common stock can be sold at a discount from the preferred. 
* The tax law gives __favorable tax treatment__ to incentive stock options (ISOs) granted by a corporation. Holders of ISOs incur no tax until the shares purchased through an option exercise are sold.

__If you want VC money, be a C corp. Most VC funds raise money from tax-exempt entities such as pension and profit-sharing trusts, universities, and charitable organizations, and these would incur unrelated business taxable income on which the non-profit must pay tax if partnership or LLC.__

### How does the business expect to return its profits to its owners?

A business can either distribute earnings to its owners or accumulate and reinvest. (Different rate of tax for long-term capital gain as opposed to current income.)

If a business intends to distribute earnings currently, a tax flow-through entity, such as partn/LLC/S Corp is the entity of choice because the earning scan be distributed without incurring a second level of tax. If a C corp is used, earnings can be paid out without being taxed only if they are paid as salary/compensation to shareholders who work for the business (this is deductible to the taxable income). Distributing earnings to shareholders which are not compensation for services will not be deductible and will even be dividend income tax (!) to its shareholders.

For biz that seeks to build long-term value, C corp (reduction of capital gains tax payable).

### Is the business expected initially to generate profits or losses?

If the biz is expected initially to generate losses, then partn/LLC/S corp because owners can deduct losses from their taxable income.

## Choosing and Protecting a Name for a Business

Must confirm name is not in conflict with existing. Secretary of state has names of all corporations in the world (even future reserved ones).

Even if SoS confirms the name is okay, there might be another biz using a name that closely resembles the name of another biz organized to do biz in that state. The laws of trademarks might then prohibit the new company from using the name (lolwut).
