- Single room in an HDB flat: $1200 in the central district.
- Toilet paper, wet wipes, jackets and sweat shirts don't make sense.
- Beaches suck, go to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand.
- Banks: DBS/POSB, UOB, OCBC, Citibank, HSBC.
- Annual fee waiving = easy.
- Grocery delivery: Sheng Siong, NTUC, RedMart.
- Gym chains, each condominium has its own gym, park connector network.
- Property Guru. WhatsApp for texting/data. Uber or Grab can give you a lot of good information re: what the area is like and if it's a good place to live.
- Most apartments are fully furnished, things like a bed and utensils.
- Rental negotiations: everything is open, and prices that the agent can give you. Negotiate 10% off. Pay first month's rent + deposit + 7% (taxes) + stamping fee/notarization of the leasing agreement. Not everything is as is. Cleaning service, curtains washed.

- Lee Kuan Yew strategy:
  - Simple, transparent, rule-driven monetary regime. Automatic adjustments keep the system in balance.
  - The currency board provides stable prices and free convertibility of the SG dollar, backed by foreign reserves and gold.
  - No foreign aid.
  - First-world, competitive private enterprises.
  - Personal security, public order, and protection of private property.
  - Small, transparent government. So first class civil servants with first class wages.
