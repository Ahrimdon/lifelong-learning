# Visa Application

Ever since I was young, I had a book called Famous Places which was so cool to me. I read it multiple times and wondered how it would be like to see those kind of places. Unfortunately because growing up we had no money, and the Philippine passport is so weak, I wasn't able to get to any of those places. But now, thirty years later, I can finally say that I can do it.

It's very hard to get a Schengen passport as a Filipino, and even harder as a remote worker. You have to have all the paperwork filled up and try to convince the embassy that you have ties to the Philippines (family, house, car). Being in Singapore makes things way easier, because in a way, the government vouches that you are a legit worker and you are going to go back to Singapore after your Europe tour is over.

The tour started with Visa application. Surprisingly, this was not the hardest thing in the world. It is criminally simple that we can just get our bank documents, our employee records, etc. in Singapore that easily. The BLS website was by no means a good one but we just got the requirements ready.

I really hate writing things down on the piece of paper, partially because I'm lazy, but partially because I suck at it. I notice that I don't grip the pen the same way most people do - I grip it near the end of it and with three fingers tightly around.

Requirements:

- Photo - just got one from Lavender.
- Passport.
- My employment pass.
- Bank statements from June, July, August: Easy to get from the DBS website.
- Travel insurance (got AXA). Got the one with Covid coverage as well. I normally don't get cause YOLO but had to for this trip. 55 euros.
- Flight bookings to and from Europe. It was 1149 each - I think this was average price. Checking Skyscanner and it looks like maybe we could have gotten it for 100 cheaper, but we had to have good timings. We left Singapore at 11pm to Munich.
- Reservation details for accommodations all throughout the trip.

# Things

- What did I buy?
  - Some cold wear. I knew I had to get a coat somewhere, but it could have been a down jacket probably.
  - Some bomber jackets from Zara (maroon and light blue) to fit some of my pants. They are solid for fashion.
  - Navy blue sweater. Solid, especially over a shirt.
  - Clark Desert boots - these were primarily to look nice and stylish. They were hard to walk in after a few hours.

- MVP: Coat from Zara, scarf from somewhere, Ultraboost shoes. Boots also really looked nice but they were just whatever.
  - The issue with the coat was that it doesn't protect the head, so.
  - The 14 inch Macbook was actually pretty robust - M1 is really fast anyway. I can't say that I need a bigger one yet.
- Things to optimize:
  - Get one of those packable day bags or packable back packs. You want to start the day off not carrying anything, but you do have to carry some things (let's say you buy a souvenir). They usually give that to you in a plastic bag, but then you would have to carry it in your hand. So if you had a backpack at that time, then you still have both hands.
  - Maybe a smaller umbrella.
  - Smaller versions of everything. Smaller perfume, smaller body cream, smaller hair wax container, smaller deodorant, etc.
  - Can probably have 1 less pair of shoes, or maybe even just 1 pair all in all. The slippers too, didn't need them. Maybe get something smaller next time.
- Tips:
  - Check restaurant contents and menu before you go inside.
  - There are really only so few things you can Google/research before going to a place.
  - Probably ask more people re: what to do when landing in Zurich etc. Lot of time to use in the plane.
  - Check the car in European trains. You can literally have the same seat number but in a different car.
  - Check-in luggage + carry-on + back pack is actually really heavy, but it is what it is.
  - Overpack - maybe you don't need to super over-pack on the "house clothes" since you wouldn't get them too dirty anyways - especially in winter time.
  - Train ticket - research more on it. We weren't able to get to 10 trains - but actually, it really is just fine.
  - Shoes - maybe can have better? Like Ultraboost is good but not sure if it was the most specialised one.

# Munich and Madrid

Landed in Munich around 5am. I can't believe it, I'm really in Europe. The immigration officer was quite straightforward - he asked us about return ticket, where we were going, and our accommodations. I showed him virtual copies of our Airbnb bookings and Han showed him the Booking.com reservation for Barcelona. After about 5 minutes we were gone and exploring Munich International Airport. First impression was wow, I really am in a different continent. So few Asians - maybe 3 in 100 or something. I didn't know that for connecting flights, they usually just bring your check-in luggage to the next airplane as well. Very convenient. We had 2 hours in Munich before our flight so we decided to just get some coffee. 1 latte for me, 1 cappuccino for Han. I think it was 10 euro for both of us. BTW, this was the first time that I spoke English to the German coffee guy, and he could understand it, but he spoke German back to me, even though he could speak English. I realise this is normal in Europe (same for Spanish waiters later). I imagine some people might think, "well why don't you speak English then" but honestly, it's fine. A part of travel is having to understand that things are different from where you came from.
