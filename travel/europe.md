# Visa Application

The tour started with Visa application. Surprisingly, this was not the hardest thing in the world. It is criminally simple that we can just get our bank documents, our employee records, etc. in Singapore that easily. The BLS website was by no means a good one but we just got the requirements ready.

I really hate writing things down on the piece of paper, partially because I'm lazy, but partially because I suck at it. I notice that I don't grip the pen the same way most people do - I grip it near the end of it and with three fingers tightly around.

# Things

- What did I buy?
  - Some cold wear. I knew I had to get a coat somewhere, but it could have been a down jacket probably.
  - Some bomber jackets from Zara (maroon and light blue) to fit some of my pants. They are solid for fashion.
  - Navy blue sweater. Solid, especially over a shirt.
  - Clark Desert boots - these were primarily to look nice and stylish. They were hard to walk in after a few hours.

- MVP: Coat from Zara, scarf from somewhere, Ultraboost shoes. Boots also really looked nice but they were just whatever.
  - The issue with the coat was that it doesn't protect the head, so.
  - The 14 inch Macbook was actually pretty robust - M1 is really fast anyway. I can't say that I need a bigger one yet.
- Things to optimize:
  - Get one of those packable day bags or packable back packs. You want to start the day off not carrying anything, but you do have to carry some things (let's say you buy a souvenir). They usually give that to you in a plastic bag, but then you would have to carry it in your hand. So if you had a backpack at that time, then you still have both hands.
  - Maybe a smaller umbrella.
  - Smaller versions of everything. Smaller perfume, smaller body cream, smaller hair wax container, smaller deodorant, etc.
  - Can probably have 1 less pair of shoes, or maybe even just 1 pair all in all. The slippers too, didn't need them. Maybe get something smaller next time.
- Tips:
  - Check restaurant contents before you go inside.
  - There are really only so few things you can Google/research before going to a place.
  - Probably ask more people re: what to do when landing in Zurich etc. Lot of time to use in the plane.
  - Check the car in European trains. You can literally have the same seat number but in a different car.
  - Check-in luggage + carry-on + back pack is actually really heavy, but it is what it is.
  - Overpack - maybe you don't need to super over-pack on the "house clothes" since you wouldn't get them too dirty anyways.
  - Train ticket - research more on it. We weren't able to get to 10 trains - but actually, it really is just fine.
  - Shoes - maybe can have better? Like Ultraboost is good but not sure if it was the most specialised one.
