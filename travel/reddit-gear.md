- `GoRuck GR2`. Lay flat packing is incredible after going with 3 top load backpacks. I still prefer top load for hiking but for working and traveling I think the clamshell load style is key.
- Clothing: Synthetic shirts. Merino wool underwear. For clothing, rule of threes--one on me, one in my bag, one washed and drying. Organization, Eagle Creek cubes. No wallets in my back pocket.
- Photography: `Sony NEX-5R`. iPad Mini is good for loading up movies and books for a long flight and for booking hostels. Gorilla pod. 2 USBs, both with passport and travel insurance information, and as a backup for pictures.
- Hygiene: Altoids cans make great holders for soap and cotton swabs. Microfiber towel doesn't take up much space but cleans up really well.
- Polarized pair of sunglasses. No pocker/utility knives.
- Recommended to journal to remember everything you see and do. Writing to recap your day at night is a great way to end the day and something you'll really appreciate long after your trip.
- Portable chargers/power packs. Anker brand.
