# Decision Skills: Power Tools to Build Your Life
[Link](https://novoed.com/decision-skills2/)

- Helpful frame: What will and when will things be decided
- Clear values: Be clear about your values, in order to have the best chance of getting what you really want.
- Creative alternatives
- Useful information:
- Sound reasoning: Values + Alternatives + Info = Decision. We can make the "I'm choosing this alternative because..."
- Commitment to follow through

Choosing between the head and heart. Everybody's decision style is influenced by their personality. Knowing decision traps is needed to break down our decisions.

An extrovert would want to talk with someone about a problem. An introvert would rather do it by yourself.

Don't make a decision when you are: Hungry, angry, lonely, tired.

__Habitual frame trap:__ When we approach all problems or decisions in the same way. Some decisions are analytical, some are feeling, but most are both.

Not all decisions are worth stressing out. Just think of the different possible outcomes of a decision.

> H.I.P. Formula

- H: How will things change?
- I: Impact on me? Others?
- P: Permanent or reversible?

__Decisions are only as good as your best alternative.__

Everyone is creative, but not everyone was taught to systematically improve their creative process. So they reject stuff with "it will never work" and "we already tried that." Reframe stuff, too. "What do I do if I had a ton of money, or no money. What Would I do if I need to decide tomorrow, or one year from now." 

#### Reality test: If you answer no to any of the three questions, the option fails.
1. Is this likely to get me what I want?
2. Is this reasonable?
3. Would I actually do this?

#### On Truth

Doctors say it's best to just tell the truth. People know if they are not doing well anyway. __Deciding to tell the truth is one thing, but determining what "the truth" is also important.__ We can say "people in your situation live x months or years, and we aren't sure what influences this."

If you have things in your communication that are not accurate, then you lose the opportunity to deepen the conversation. Why would you want people in your life that are likely false people? 

It's like training wheels on bicycles. You'll never learn how to ride a bike if you don't take the training wheels off. So telling the truth is the way to get accurate feedback.

"My ethics is determined by what I do." (Action-based ethics) or "My ethics is determined by the results of what I do." (Consequence-based ethics) Decision skills are leaning to the consequence-based. It's not preferences, but it's about you.

__Buddha story: "Can you cut that tree's branch off?" Murderer did. "Can you put it back on?" The murderer became enlightened.__

Ex: In a decent college, the idea of bribing a teacher to get a higher grade was unthinkable. __When we make things unthinkable, that's when we are transcendent.__ The unexamined life is not worth doing. If you don't examine what you do, when you look back on the past you'll feel bad.

Weight table/pros & cons list. Weight of stuff puts numbers on the values so it gives you clarities.

Test different values to see if they impact your decision. If you have uncertainty, you also want to handle that.

Beware of inutitive decisions, we aren't expected to handle them. Know your limitations and when you need to get help. Remember to keep at stuff, consistently better decisions make better outcomes.

The highest quality decisions come when we make our decisions with both our heads and hearts.

If the decision becomes "something doesn't feel like", you need to think of something. Think of reassigning the percentages.

Grit has more correlation to success than intelligence. With that being said it is helpful to plan for flexibility. So choose a strategy that allows for change.

__SMART: Specific, measurable, achieveable, recordable, timely.__

Recordable: Tell people what you are working on. You reinforce your own commitment when you talk with others. Specific and measurable: You should be able to see it happen. Achievable: Connected to motivation, flow. Focus on something you can control or influence but prepare for uncertainties.

__A decision is just a choice unless it is followed by an action.__

1. Communicate: If you're serious in doing things, why not write it down?
2. Get help: Ask a friend to text you every week to see if you're practicing. It's better if you have someone who is interested in your progress. Get a coach if you have to.
3. Plan: Find out how other people learned stuff, and have a checklist to see how you make a goal.
4. Command your calendar: Time your schedule to follow through your plan.
When looking for a job, position yourself in a way that the manager thinks of you as a good decision.

## Coin Toss Exercise

Decision: Are you the kind of person who raises your hand when people ask you to raise your hand?

If I were to flip that coin, what would you pay to get a percentage correct?

When you get opportunities to volunteer, do you ask what for?

Decisions

	Play = 50% $20, or 50% 0.
	Not Play = $5.

It's mathematical and we're comfortable with that, but when it comes to judgment, we're uncomfortable about it. 

You have to think about bad decisions leading to good outcomes.

## Decision quality framework

If I can't view the decisions without hindsight, how can I judge it?

What makes a good decison?

- I am clear on the problem that I am solving
- I have identified what I truly want
- I have generated a good set of alternatives
- I have gathered the relevant information needed
- I have evaluated the alternatives to the information
- I have committed to follow on my own choice

- Helpful frame: What will and when will things be decided
- Clear values: What we want to happen and not to happen. This will allow us to make trade-offs.
- Creative alternatives: Possible courses of action that we can choose.
- Useful information: Focusing on what we know will be helpful: Data on the past and on the future
- Sound reasoning: Values + Alternatives + infromation = Decision. We can make the "I'm choosing this alternative because..."
- Commitment to follow through: We are able to move from intention to action, and at that point we have no reservations. This means planning ahead so we can overcome the problem.

You need all of the six. Figure out if you have done the best for all part of the change. We have a good decision when all links are strong. That's using foresight, not hindsight.

__A decision is only strongest as the longest link.__

## Himalayan Decision Tree

Suggest to split the group? Don't do this because easier to have things to go wrong because of communication.

Decision tree

	Go back -> Good exp, great exp, bad exp
	Over the top -> Make it with no injufy, injury going to, injury going back
	Helicopter -> The time, we might even go back

The information is the weakest link. You need to increase the information you know.

Good scenario: Over the top, make it no injury. So figure out how you get to do this.

Second good scenario: Attempt the helicopter.

Third good scenario: If we pay X to get the helicopter, how much can we actually get in pleasure in Kathmandu?

At the end, they decided that it would suck to go back, and an injury would suck too. So they waited for a helicopter. For two days nothing passed, but they saw a military helicopter go on the third day. So they want to ask if a helicopter can come, so they ask someone to go up the path to Manang. They were able to convince the Colonel there to send them a helicopter. So they got to Manang :)

## Behavioral Decision Making

Decision Traps: Cognitive biases.

Choosing between the head and heart. Everybody's decision style is influenced by their personality. Knowing decision traps is needed to break down our decisions.

## Guest Lecture with Prof. Barbara Mellers

What a "decision" is differs for most people. Some people think they make tons of decisions, they qualify eating breakfast as a decision. But habits are different from decisions. They might be decisions before, but they are habits now. We don't decide to brush our teeth. These are habits and it isn't helpful to think of them as decisions.

Decisions are things that have control. They are important. When you realize that something is important to write about, then you can write them a letter. She didn't get mad at them, she just told them what could be done, and they moved on. This is an example of where feelings and dealing with them are important. It is important to think about what you should have done, and that __requires enormous self-control__.

One thing a decision is not is an outcome. If I decide to watch a movie and it's terrible, it's not necessarily a bad decision. A good or bad decision refers to the process by which I arrive to the outcome. We don't know what happens with our decisions, we focus on things that come readily to mind. It is called __the availability bias__. If your friend was in a car accident last month, you would give a higher risk number to get a car accident yourself. We pull stuff in the back of your mind to compute stuff.

If you ask yourself what percentage efforts you've done for chores, you do a mental checklist of what you've done. When they combine the percentages, you get about 130%. Husbands + wives focus on what they did, not what the other person did.

__Overconfidence bias:__ We like to think well of ourselves, and we think of ourselves in a positive light. When we are guessing a true or false, either we have 50% knowledge (no idea) or 100% knowledge (sure). It turns out that people think they are 85% confident but they got 60% right. You think you know more than you originally know. This matters when you go to doctors and stuff. Most people don't check and adjust their beliefs to see the data about their outcomes.

__Confirmation bias:__ Poor search processes and the information we focus on. We like to focus on things that confirm our original beliefs. When trying to go out someone and I know just 2 people who know him, 1 likes and 1 doesn't. I call the person who likes him, because he supports my decision. We look for things that are consistent with what we want to hear.

## Personality Type and Decision Style

- Extraversion vs. Introversion: Extroverts get energy being a group, and introverts get energized through ideas.
- Sensing vs. Intuition: Sensates focus on the five senses, and intuition is about the big picture and the possibility.
- Thinking vs. Feeling: How we reach conclusions. T focuses on logic and reason, F focuses on values associated with people.
- Judging vs. Perceiving: Judging wants to have structure to make a conclusion, perceiving wants to be free.

Sensing-Intuition and Thinking-Feeling are pretty important when making decisions. 

Sensing would like to narrow the frame, while intuition wants to make it bigger. We want to be in the middle.

Similarly when Thinking vs. Feeling, F thinks it is about the people, and T thinks it is about the content and the technicals. People might see past each other for this.

- _NF_: Big picture, future possibilities. Peopel and relationships.
- _ST_: Reality, facts, and the present. Objective cause and effect.

- _NT_: Big picture, future possibilities. Objective cause and effect.
- _SF_: Reality, facts and the present. Individuals and relationships.

An extrovert would want to talk with someone about a problem. An introvert would rather do it by yourself. If everyone is introverted, then you have to find a complement. 

Same with Judging and Perceiving, this is why you want a framework for decisions because J want to do it know, and P wants to evaluate possibilities first.

## Decision Traps

These are errors in our thinking about how we constrain our decisions.

Decision fitness and decision state.

Physical and emotional states combine to form your decision state, and the decision state is the basis for all your decisions.

Think of a time in the past month when you realized that you made a decision while in an unfit decision state. I was super hungry lol.

> HALT: Hungry, angry, lonely, tired.

Don't make decisions when you are in that bad decision state.

Bandwagon effect: When people do things just because other people do. You're not thinking clearly.

Decision traps, like optical illusions, are so sneaky.

## I'm Thinking of a Feeling

When I have an argument with myself, my head usually thinks of one thing and my heart is thinking of another.

Sometimes when you don't feel right when you make a decision (head and heart conflict). When you choose both, you fall in a trap.

__Habitual frame trap:__ When we approach all problems ore decisions in the same way. Some decisions are analytical, some are feeling, but most are both.

When you are asked to make a decision, make questions that are about what you consider and think if they are from the head or from the heart.

List your head and heart reasons and think if there are conflicts.

## Look at it This Way

You need to know what to capture and why. You need to find out the right subject and a right perspective.

Trap: Others make you see something from their perspective. Advertisers love this. Thrown frame.

Selective perception: We only see what we expect to see.

Engineers recommend faster motors. Design firm recommended putting a mirror and potted plant so people can change your perception.

Anchoring: When you cling too tightly to one piece of information or get stuck on one point of view.

Often, what we see is what we expect to see.

## Size it Up

Not all decisions are worth stressing out. Just think of the different possible outcomes of a decision.

__H.I.P. Formula__

- H: How will things change?
- I: Impact on me? Others?
- P: Permanent or reversible?

Subjectivity: People have different interpretations of the same thing/event.

## Carl Spetzler on Framing

Framing is the most common mistake. Clear purpose, defined scope, conscious perspective. Approach it the right way with the right people involved.

Decisions don't come nicely packaged. The decisions we should be making depend on your pont of view are things we struggle with.

Decision hiearchy for the house:

- Take as given. (We'll be in this area for at least another 5-10 years.)
- Decide now (What do we want in a house for the next 5-10 years? Stay/remodel/move? Where?)
- Decide later (Painting, financing, contractors.)

## What's your problem?

Purpose/scope as an essential step in framing your decision.

Purpose: Make the room a nicer place to hang out and a better places to study. Scope: What's in and what's out? Moving isn't in scope.

What's been decided, what needs to be decided now, what needs to be designed in the future?

- Decided: Not moving to another apartment. No huge renovations. $200 budget.
- What can be easily changed?
- Future: What to do  

Another trap: Sunk cost. THE MONEY IS ALREADY GONE.

HIP: Not that big. Impact is on me. Not really permanent. Head-heart: Head is cost and investment of time, heart is happiness.

## What do I really want?

Be clear about your values, in order to have the best chance of getting what you really want.

Use your values for your decisions! Don't just allow people to talk you into what they want, not what they want.

Want: Afford, gas mileage, cute, safe, good size, comfortable for friends, won't break down.

To know what is most important, you can eliminate what is less important.

Use trade-offs, math, etc.

## Frame and Values

I wasn't enjoying my job anymore and when I was thinking about what I was going to do with my live, I decided to reprioritize. I quit my job.

I was losing my friendships, I hadn't talked to my friends in a very long time and I wanted to build those back again. My parents, they are just 20 minutes away and I haven't talked to them in months.

We want to make a useful frame, write down stuff. The key thing is my health. I have to be healthy to make the rest of my life work. If I was as healthy as I can, I can spend more time with the relationships that I miss. What I did was to do something healthy with my dad to get both things at once.

I know I can accomplish goals so I have hope moving forward.

## Introducing Creative Alternatives and Useful Information

__Decisions are only as good as your best alternative.__

Decision trap: _Either I go or I don't._ 

Is it a date? Do I like this person? Do I trust this person? Will I have fun? What are the odds of a good outcome?

My brain was rather "do I go to college", I did a "what is best to achieve my goals"?

Everyone is creative, but not everyone was taught to systematically improve their creative process. So they reject stuff with "it will never work" and "we already tried that." Reframe stuff, too. "What do I do if I had a ton of money, or no money. What Would I do if I need to decide tomorrow, or one year from now." 

Where to go to college? Instead of community->university, how about move->CC->univ? 

What makes a decision complex is multiple values, multiple alternatives, and uncertainty. This is where the language of probability helps us to communicate clearly and think straight. This leads us to sound reasoning, and identify the sources of value.

## IYC #10: Creative Alternatives

Either-or trap: I want to go to grad school and I don't have money. I either get money from my parents or get stuck in my stupid job.

Just think of creative alternatives, don't filter. Temp job in a different office, summer fellowship with a psychology professor, folow Bieber on his summer, sell paintings at the Art Show, apply for a waitress job, audition for a role with a summer theater company.

#### Reality test: If you answer no to any of the three questions, the option fails.

1. Is this likely to get me what I want?
2. Is this reasonable?
3. Would I actually do this?

Sometimes knowing what you don't want is even better than what you want.

#### Remove
- No Bieber because it fails to get what I want.
- I don't think selling paintings are reasonable.
- I would not actually do the waitress job.

> Was there something you failed to think?

+ Get job at summer arts camp.
+ Get job building sets at a summer theater company.

## Professor Ron Howard on Creative Alternatives and Values

Many decisions that we make are not ethically sensitive but there are decisions that you make wherein you have to take an ethical stance on it. 

Most of these decisions are also made quickly. You better do some preparation in formulating decisions to know which ones are ethically sensitive.

Physical harm, depriving them of property, truth-telling ("How do I look in my dress", "How am I doing?" (dying person)).

Professionals say it's best to just tell the truth. People know if they are not doing well anyway. __Deciding to tell the truth is one thing, but determining what "the truth" is also important.__ We can say "people in your situation live x months or years, and we aren't sure what influences this."

If you have things in your communication that are not accurate, then you lose the opportunity to deepen the conversation. Why would you want people in your life that are likely false people? 

It's like training wheels on bicycles. You'll never learn how to ride a bike if you don't take the training wheels off. So telling the truth is the way to get accurate feedback.

"My ethics is determined by what I do." (action-based ethics) or "My ethics is determined by the results of what I do." (consequence-based ethics) Decision skills are leaning to the consequence-based. It's not preferences, but it's about you.

Even stuff such as cheating/overbilling is harder when you're telling the truth, it's more of determining what the truth is.

__Buddha story: "Can you cut that tree's branch off?" Murderer did. "Can you put it back on?" The murderer became enlightened.__

That's transforming. Buddha showed the murderer that there was a higher plane of thinking. That's the ultimate elevation.

You don't suddenly become ethically aware all of a sudden. Usually you have to realize that "this is a way you want to be throughout your life." But when you're used to being that way, then there is no problem.

Ex: In college, the idea of bribing a teacher to get a higher grade was unthinkable. __When we make things unthinkable, that's when we are transcendent.__ The unexamined life is not worth doing. If you don't examine what you do, when you look back on the past you'll feel bad.

A good decision never becomes bad, and a bad decision never becomes good.

## IYC #11: Information - Probability

When buying stuff: How much faster, and how many flaws does the competitor have? Did you check reviews? Check for RELEVANT features XD.

Wishful thinking decision trap: When we make decisions according to what we wnat to ahppen rather than rely on evidence or reality.

Overconfidence decision trap: An excessive belief in the truth of your own beliefs. So you don't test your information to know if it's reliable.

Just thinking of putting something on the line (money or dignity) makes you know what you want.

Numbers: Even if things are uncertain, why not just add a number too? Instead of using "maybe", "might", why not just add a number to make your confidence level clearer?

## Week 5: Useful Information and Sound Reasoning

Weight table/pros & cons list. Weight of stuff puts numbers on the values so it gives you clarities.

Test different values to see if they impact your decision. If you have uncertainty, you also want to handle that.

Beware of inutitive decisions, we aren't expected to handle them. Know your limitations and when you need to get help. Remember to keep at stuff, consistently better decisions make better outcomes.

## Week 5- IYC Episode 12: How Likely Is It?

When you can't control shit, it's helpful to have probability.

Rule #1: Any alternative can have multiple outcomes.

Rule #2: There are two types of events that affect outcome: Independent and dependent. Gambler's Fallacy!

__Trap: Wishful thinking. Overestimating the likelihood of a certain outcome just because you want it to happen.__ When making a decision, think "what would have to happen so this happens?"

## Guest Lecture: Prof. Abbas on Sound Reasoning

Suppose your company is choosing a new CEO out of 6 possible candidates. They thought of doing a majority survey.

He was able to get F to win, even if C > D > E > F. Even if we get eleemnts of decision right, we can still make a bad decision.

## Week 5- IYC Episode 13: Building a Tree

Coach thought to shoot the 3 instead of the 2 using the graph and shooting percentages.

## Prof. Abbas - Reasoning through Hamlet's Dilemma

Hamlet's father died and he was there to protect the lands. Hamlet's uncle married his mom and he was in doubt whether his uncle had something to do with his death. And there, he had "to be" or "not to be".

Hamlet was deciding if he wanted to kill himself. If he stays alive, he "bears the scorns of time". If he dies, he could dream (to bear the ills) or not dream (end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks).

He prefers B (not-to-be-not-dream), A (current-life), and C (not-to-be-dream) (he hates this).

If he preferred B and C to A? Then it is easy, better to "not to be". If he prefers A to B and C, better "to be." But the problem is he is B > A > C.

Indifference probability: If you could get A for certain, or a deal where you can get either A or C, what probability queue would you prefer?

## Week 5- IYC Episode 14: Makes Sense and Feels Right

The highest quality decisions come when we make our decisions with both our heads and hearts.

Use pro-con list or weight table to know what you are looking for when making a decision.

Preference: Enjoyment, college application, something new. If the decision becomes "something doesn't feel like", you need to think of something. Think of reassigning the percentages.

## Week #6 Commitment to Follow Through

Commitment is the part of the decision that happens after, but you can't just expect an outcome to happen, you have to act on it.

There's always a part of a decision wherein you can't go back.

Grit has more correlation to success than intelligence. With that being said it is helpful to plan for flexibility. So choose a strategy that allows for change.

But there could be a time where you need to go all-in.

SMART: Specific, measurable, achieveable, recordable, timely.

Recordable: Tell people what you are working on. You reinforce your own commitment when you talk with others. Specific and measurable: You should be able to see it happen. Achievable: Connected to motivation, flow. Focus on something you can control or influence but prepare for uncertainties.

Some people want a big goal that can ignite your passion.

I asked myself: "Why do people do these ironman competitions?" So I joined a team to do this. So that's my commitment to follow through on something. The thing that is going to get you to do shit is to use the decision chain.

Go with a process that is as big as what you need. Get the help you need. Why not explain it to somebody?

If you value alternatives equally, just flip a coin, then you'll know what you want.

## IYC #16: Commitment to Follow Through

__A decision is just a choice unless it is followed by an action.__

1. Communicate: If you're serious of doing things, why not write it down?
2. Get help: Ask a friend to text you every week to see if you're practicing. It's better if you have someone who is interested in your progress. Get a coach if you have to.
3. Plan: Find out how other people learned stuff, and have a checklist to see how you make a goal.
4. Command your calendar: Time your schedule to follow through your plan.

## IYC #17 Process and Review

A quality group decision benefits from the same tool.

Communicate and clarify: Tell others want you want/prefer. Figure out the information you want. Offer alternatives. Eliminate the impractical stuff.

Decision traps in a group: Decision fatigue, when you are trapped and you just want to not think anymore.

When looking for a job, position yourself in a way that the manager thinks of you as a good decision.
