## The Himalayan Decision Scenario

The goal is to know the high school students in Manang, Nepal. There is a feeling you get when you do something right, and when you do something wrong. Getting information in Nepal is sketchy because you can get information from anywhere.

Flood thing about 70 yards from the village. Options: Go back to Kathmandu, take another path (chance of injury), get a helicopter. WTF should you do?

## Coin Toss Exercise

Decision: Are you the kind of person who raises your hand when people ask you to raise your hand?

If I were to flip that coin, what would you pay to get a percentage correct?

When you get opportunities to volunteer, do you ask what for?

Decisions

	Play = 50% $20, or 50% 0.
	Not Play = $5.

It's mathematical and we're comfortable with that, but when it comes to judgment, we're uncomfortable about it. 

You have to think about bad decisions leading to good outcomes.

## Decision quality framework

If I can't view the decisions without hindsight, how can I judge it?

What makes a good decison?

- I am clear on the problem that I am solving
- I have identified what I truly want
- I have generated a good set of alternatives
- I have gathered the relevant information needed
- I have evaluated the alternatives to the information
- I have committed to follow on my own choice

- Helpful frame: What will and when will things be decided
- Clear values: What we want to happen and not to happen. This will allow us to make trade-offs.
- Creative alternatives: Possible courses of action that we can choose.
- Useful information: Focusing on what we know will be helpful: Data on the past and on the future
- Sound reasoning: Values + Alternatives + infromation = Decision. We can make the "I'm choosing this alternative because..."
- Commitment to follow through: We are able to move from intention to action, and at that point we have no reservations. This means planning ahead so we can overcome the problem.

You need all of the six. Figure out if you have done the best for all part of the change. We have a good decision when all links are strong. That's using foresight, not hindsight.

__A decision is only strongest as the longest link.__

His big decision was going to Ukraine for a year after graduation. Basically it is a spoiler! :))))

## Himalayan Decision Tree

Suggest to split the group? Don't do this because easier to have things to go wrong because of communication.

Decision tree

	Go back -> Good exp, great exp, bad exp
	Over the top -> Make it with no injufy, injury going to, injury going back
	Helicopter -> The time, we might even go back

The information is the weakest link. You need to increase the information you know.

Good scenario: Over the top, make it no injury. So figure out how you get to do this.

Second good scenario: Attempt the helicopter.

Third good scenario: If we pay X to get the helicopter, how much can we actually get in pleasure in Kathmandu?




try for helicopter then go back then take another path but it depends on the percentages
