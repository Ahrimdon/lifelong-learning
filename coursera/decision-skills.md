## The Himalayan Decision Scenario

The goal is to know the high school students in Manang, Nepal. There is a feeling you get when you do something right, and when you do something wrong. Getting information in Nepal is sketchy because you can get information from anywhere.

Flood thing about 70 yards from the village. Options: Go back to Kathmandu, take another path (chance of injury), get a helicopter. WTF should you do?

## Coin Toss Exercise

Decision: Are you the kind of person who raises your hand when people ask you to raise your hand?

If I were to flip that coin, what would you pay to get a percentage correct?

When you get opportunities to volunteer, do you ask what for?

Decisions

	Play = 50% $20, or 50% 0.
	Not Play = $5.

It's mathematical and we're comfortable with that, but when it comes to judgment, we're uncomfortable about it. 

You have to think about bad decisions leading to good outcomes.

## Decision quality framework

If I can't view the decisions without hindsight, how can I judge it?

What makes a good decison?

- I am clear on the problem that I am solving
- I have identified what I truly want
- I have generated a good set of alternatives
- I have gathered the relevant information needed
- I have evaluated the alternatives to the information
- I have committed to follow on my own choice

- Helpful frame: What will and when will things be decided
- Clear values: What we want to happen and not to happen. This will allow us to make trade-offs.
- Creative alternatives: Possible courses of action that we can choose.
- Useful information: Focusing on what we know will be helpful: Data on the past and on the future
- Sound reasoning: Values + Alternatives + infromation = Decision. We can make the "I'm choosing this alternative because..."
- Commitment to follow through: We are able to move from intention to action, and at that point we have no reservations. This means planning ahead so we can overcome the problem.

You need all of the six. Figure out if you have done the best for all part of the change. We have a good decision when all links are strong. That's using foresight, not hindsight.

__A decision is only strongest as the longest link.__

His big decision was going to Ukraine for a year after graduation. Basically it is a spoiler! :))))

## Himalayan Decision Tree

Suggest to split the group? Don't do this because easier to have things to go wrong because of communication.

Decision tree

	Go back -> Good exp, great exp, bad exp
	Over the top -> Make it with no injufy, injury going to, injury going back
	Helicopter -> The time, we might even go back

The information is the weakest link. You need to increase the information you know.

Good scenario: Over the top, make it no injury. So figure out how you get to do this.

Second good scenario: Attempt the helicopter.

Third good scenario: If we pay X to get the helicopter, how much can we actually get in pleasure in Kathmandu?

At the end, they decided that it would suck to go back, and an injury would suck too. So they waited for a helicopter. For two days nothing passed, but they saw a military helicopter go on the third day. So they want to ask if a helicopter can come, so they ask someone to go up the path to Manang. They were able to convince the Colonel there to send them a helicopter. So they got to Manang :)

## Behavioral Decision Making

Decision Traps: Cognitive biases.

Choosing between the head and heart. Everybody's decision style is influenced by their personality. Knowing decision traps is needed to break down our decisions.

## Guest Lecture with Prof. Barbara Mellers

What a "decision" differs for most people. Some people think they make tons of decisions, they qualify eating breakfast as a decision. But habits are different from decisions. They might be decisions before, but they are habits now. We don't decide to brush our teeth. These are habits and it isn't helpful to think of them as decisions.

Decisions are things that have control. They are important. When you realize that something is important to write about, then you can write them a letter. She didn't get mad at them, she just told them what could be done, and they moved on. This is an example of where feelings and dealing with them are important. It is important to think about what you should have done, and that __requires enormous self-control__.

One thing a decision is not is an outcome. If I decide to watch a movie and it's terrible, it's not necessarily a bad decision. A good or bad decision refers to the process by which I arrive to the outcome. We don't know what happens with our decisions, we focus on things that come readily to mind. It is called __the availability bias__. If your friend was in a car accident last month, you would give a higher risk number to get a car accident yourself. We pull stuff in the back of your mind to compute stuff.

If you ask yourself what percentage efforts you've done for chores, you do a mental checklist of what you've done. When they combine the percentages, you get about 130%. Husbands + wives focus on what they did, not what the other person did.

__Overconfidence bias:__ We like to think well of ourselves, and we think of ourselves in a positive light. When we are guessing a true or false, either we have 50% knowledge (no idea) or 100% knowledge (sure). It turns out that people think they are 85% confident but they got 60% right. You think you know more than you originally know. This matters when you go to doctors and stuff. Most people don't check and adjust their beliefs to see the data about their outcomes.

__Confirmation bias:__ Poor search processes and the information we focus on. We like to focus on things that confirm our original beliefs. When trying to go out someone and I know just 2 people who know him, 1 likes and 1 doesn't. I call the person who likes him, because he supports my decision. We look for things that are consistent with what we want to hear.

## Personality Type and Decision Style

- Extraversion vs. Introversion: Extroverts get energy being a group, and introverts get energized through ideas.
- Sensing vs. Intuition: Sensates focus on the five senses, and intuition is about the big picture and the possibility.
- Thinking vs. Feeling: How we reach conclusions. T focuses on logic and reason, F focuses on values associated with people.
- Judging vs. Perceiving: Judging wants to have structure to make a conclusion, perceiving wants to be free.

Sensing-Intuition and Thinking-Feeling are pretty important when making decisions. 

Sensing would like to narrow the frame, while intuition wants to make it bigger. We want to be in the middle.

Similarly when Thinking vs. Feeling, F thinks it is about the people, and T thinks it is about the content and the technicals. People might see past each other for this.

- _NF_: Big picture, future possibilities. Peopel and relationships.
- _ST_: Reality, facts, and the present. Objective cause and effect.

- _NT_: Big picture, future possibilities. Objective cause and effect.
- _SF_: Reality, facts and the present. Individuals and relationships.

An extrovert would want to talk with someone about a problem. An introvert would rather do it by yourself. If everyone is introverted, then you have to find a complement. 

Same with Judging and Perceiving, this is why you want a framework for decisions because J want to do it know, and P wants to evaluate possibilities first.

## Decision Traps

These are errors in our thinking about how we constrain our decisions.

Decision fitness and decision state.

Physical and emotional states combine to form your decision state, and the decision state is the basis for all your decisions.

Think of a time in the past month when you realized that you made a decision while in an unfit decision state. I was super hungry lol.

> HALT: Hungry, angry, lonely, tired.

Don't make decisions when you are in that bad decision state.

Bandwagon effect: When people do things just because other people do. You're not thinking clearly.

Decision traps, like optical illusions, are so sneaky.

## I'm Thinking of a Feeling

When I have an argument with myself, my head usually thinks of one thing and my heart is thinking of another.

Sometimes when you don't feel right when you make a decision (head and heart conflict). When you choose both, you fall in a trap.

__Habitual frame trap:__ When we approach all problems ore decisions in the same way. Some decisions are analytical, some are feeling, but most are both.

When you are asked to make a decision, make questions that are about what you consider and think if they are from the head or from the heart.

List your head and heart reasons and think if there are conflicts.

## Look at it This Way

You need to know what to capture and why. You need to find out the right subject and a right perspective.

Trap: Others make you see something from their perspective. Advertisers love this. Thrown frame.

Selective perception: We only see what we expect to see.

Engineers recommend faster motors. Design firm recommended putting a mirror and potted plant so people can change your perception.

Anchoring: When you cling too tightly to one piece of information or get stuck on one point of view.

Often, what we see is what we expect to see.

## Size it Up

Not all decisions are worth stressing out. Just think of the different possible outcomes of a decision.

__H.I.P. Formula__

- H: How will things change?
- I: Impact on me? Others?
- P: Permanent or reversible?

Subjectivity: People have different interpretations of the same thing/event.

## Carl Spetzler on Framing

Framing is the most common mistake. Clear purpose, defined scope, conscious perspective. Approach it the right way with the right people involved.

Decisions don't come nicely packaged. The decisions we should be making depend on your pont of view are things we struggle with.

Decision hiearchy for the house:

- Take as given. (We'll be in this area for at least another 5-10 years.)
- Decide now (What do we want in a house for the next 5-10 years? Stay/remodel/move? Where?)
- Decide later (Painting, financing, contractors.)

## What's your problem?

Purpose/scope as an essential step in framing your decision.

Purpose: Make the room a nicer place to hang out and a better places to study. Scope: What's in and what's out? Moving isn't in scope.

What's been decided, what needs to be decided now, what needs to be designed in the future?

- Decided: Not moving to another apartment. No huge renovations. $200 budget.
- What can be easily changed?
- Future: What to do  

Another trap: Sunk cost. THE MONEY IS ALREADY GONE.

HIP: Not that big. Impact is on me. Not really permanent. Head-heart: Head is cost and investment of time, heart is happiness.

## What do I really want?

Be clear about your values, in order to have the best chance of getting what you really want.

Use your values for your decisions! Don't just allow people to talk you into what they want, not what they want.

Want: Afford, gas mileage, cute, safe, good size, comfortable for friends, won't break down.

To know what is most important, you can eliminate what is less important.

Use trade-offs, math, etc.

## Frame and Values

I wasn't enjoying my job anymore and when I was thinking about what I was going to do with my live, I decided to reprioritize. I quit my job.

I was losing my friendships, I hadn't talked to my friends in a very long time and I wanted to build those back again. My parents, they are just 20 minutes away and I haven't talked to them in months.

We want to make a useful frame, write down stuff. The key thing is my health. I have to be healthy to make the rest of my life work. If I was as healthy as I can, I can spend more time with the relationships that I miss. What I did was to do something healthy with my dad to get both things at once.

I know I can accomplish goals so I have hope moving forward.
