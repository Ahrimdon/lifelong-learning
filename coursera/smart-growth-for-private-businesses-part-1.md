The Eyebob's glasses or it's fuddy-duddy  glasses.  Alright, that's what Eyedobs, Eyebobs  builds, ladies and gentlemen,  they manufacture fashion high quality  reading glasses. 

And the Eyebobs story is the story of Julie Allinson. Wasn't this a fascinating read?  A fascinating story, okay?  Here is a woman, okay, that really late  in life, decided she wanted to start a business. 

But the first point Julie makes is, is how she didn't want to borrow money from a bank when she started her business. She didn't want to have investors. Most people think about, wow, I need to go get investors or maybe I need to, to borrow money. But Julie said, no, I didn't want to do  that. 

If you have, if you owe banks money or you owe investors money, what do you have by definition? Your bank is your" partner". Your friends are your partner. But what do they really want to know? How much money are we making, when I'm going to get my money back plus my profit? 

Julie said, I didn't want anybody beating on my back, grow faster, grow faster. I wanted to be comfortable with it. I wanted to make the decisions, not someone else pushing me to make decisions. 

I happen to love the point that Julie makes the analogy between entrepreneurship and farmers. What do farmers do everyday? In season, they get up and they go out and work sunup to sundown. Some days they plow, some days they fertilize, some days they water, some days they pull weeds, some days they harvest. Some days they plow under and then, some days they start all over. 

Well, ladies and gentlemen, growing a business is just like farming. Sunup to sundown and basically some days, you're fixing mistakes, plowing under, some days you're building the platform, building the processes, teaching, training the people. 

Some days you're out there planting seeds, calling own customers. Every day you go to the business and every day you must work on the business. 

And one interesting, when she said on page two, I didn't want to live that type of life but I ended up just like them, being a entrepreneur. 

She goes into quite detail about what was the process of starting her company. because the reason I want to go into this, even though it's before she grew a business, it shows you the type of homework that's required even if you try to grow your company. 

You have to think through. How am I going to manufacture more? How am I going to sell more? How am I going to deliver more? How do I keep my quality? And Julie, okay, remember, used her own money, she bootstrapped, she bootstrapped. 

She basically says, how do I manufacture? What did she do? She went to China and she visited 24 manufacturers. And she learned, she learned how they do it.

Why did she go? Because she wanted to see for herself, because she's going to be back in Minnesota, she wanted to see who would manufacture her glasses. 

What role and how big she had to be until she got top spot, top quality? Was she going to be important to these people? Were they going to give her the best quality workers? Were they going to give her the best quality raw materials? 

She went and put her boots on the ground. She did her homework. And what she learned was the best quality, the best quality ingredients came from Italy. And now, we're talking really about this concept here of manufacturing the product. It came from Italy. 

What did she do? She went to Italy, she went to Italy. And she met the people in Italy. And she learned a very important lesson. If I want people to take me seriously and to care about my product, I need to personalize it. 

Business is really all about people, ladies and gentleman. It's people making stuff for people, selling stuff to people, taking care of people, hiring people. so you can grow and do more. Business is a people business, most businesses. 

She went and she found a manufacturer in Italy, okay, who not only had the best quality materials, just like used in the high fashion Italian eyewear, but they had manufacturing plants in China and they agreed to take on her business. Hard work and some luck basically helped Julie solve her manufacturing problem. 

How does she get customers?  What's the obvious question? Let's go to opticians.She went toopticians. Now, an optician, how does an optician make money? Sell the most profitable which usually, in this case, is the most expensive glasses. What happened? The opticians put them under the shelf because they'd rather sell you the expensive ones first. 

And then, when they didn't want to lose a sale, they brought out Julie's. It took Julie a while to learn this, ladies and gentlemen. 

Then, she was at a loss. Julie's breakthrough came in a men's store in Minneapolis, a men's store that sells like sport coats, shirts, to men. And she went to the owner and he says, Julie I've tried to sell lots of things and nothing has worked. But because you're local, you're one of us, I'll try it. 

Julie is selling women's fashion, quality reading glasses in a men's store. Who's buying them? The women that come in either with children, sons, husbands, or men who want to take a gift home. 

So, Julie said whoo, I've got to find more men's stores and what did she do? The owner of the men's store said, Julie you should go to a fashion men's stores trade show, which is a big convention of people like me in New York. 

She found out that all the sales reps for the, loved the glasses. In fact, she sold a lot of them to the sales reps. But she didn't sell a lot to the stores. She went back again the next show and those same sales reps came back and they bought for their clients because they had used the glasses or loved ones had used the glasses or friends had used the glasses and the glasses were high quality. 

Julie grew her business. First, she had to find the right manufacturing and then she had to find the right distribution channel. The right road to, if you will, the right road to the customer and it's this distribution channel, okay? 

Now, with this growth, came some issues, didn't it? Julie talked about in the case how she 
basically started her business and hired two, three people, hourly workers, answered the phone, do customer service, do the accounting, do the administrating. 

Julie wanted the glasses shipped from China to Minneapolis so she could inspect them all. She wanted to keep control of quality control because she knew a bad pair of glasses was bad for business. She wanted to keep control of actually the shipping, so she knew when it was going to get to her customer. Julie, in lots of ways, okay, knew what to keep control of, alright? Control of that customer contract and control ultimately of that quality control function. 

When you're growing your business and you start adding people, you, the entrepreneur, always keep control of the money. No one writes checks but you in the beginning. No one charges anything but you in the beginning. You have to control the money. 

Why? Because money is the lifeblood of the business circulatory system. If you get out of whack on money, you either got to go ask people for money, borrow against your house, go into your savings account, go into your kids' college account. 

You got to basically know where you are every day with money. Remember, in the case Julie said, cash flow is king. 

Now, Julie, okay, now faced her first people issues, challenges. And what did she do? She did what we call upgrading. Julie upgraded and went and found experienced people, two of them, in fact. And she got very fortunate, In fact, she was lucky. 

Most people do not make great hires the first time. Because of Julie's prior experience, she had experience, she had learned how to interview people, how to have hiring processes. 

Growth requires you to put in processes, remember? Growth stresses people processes and controls. Julie knew how to hire people, how to interview people, how to onboard people. And she found Kim and Saul. Both who came with lots of experience. 

And then Julie did something else that few entrepreneurs or many entrepreneurs find it hard to do. She was very honest, Julie, about what she was good at and what she was not good at. 

And she learned that I love design. I love, if you will, selling. I'm not good at customer service. I don't handle phone customers calling in really complaining. It's hard for me to act the way I need to act because all I want to do is interrupt and solve the problem. 

Kim was a professional at that. Kim added value to Julie, Julie's business because she complimented her. Saul had experience in a big department store. He knew distribution, logistics, and modernized at all. Julie, also at the time, put in some technology. 

As you learned in the case, her husband, new technology. And he did it part-time. But then, as you learned in the case as the business grew, Julie's husband came to work full-time to be in charge of accounting, because he was a CPA, and technology. 

Julie went from one employee to three, four employees, counting herself, back to one employee, added Kim, Saul, and her husband, and then grew as you know from four to eighteen employees in an iterative fashion as her business grew. 

Julie says, on page eleven, unmanaged growth could easily swallow you up. She had this fear of losing control because if she lost control, bad eyewear would get out there and what hurts you in business? 

Bad customer reputation, bad customer references, okay? That hurts you more than anything. She also was very, very selective about who her customers were going to be. She says, I only want customers that can pay me. I just don't want to sell glasses on credit to retailers. I want to sell them to the right people who can pay me on time. 

And notice how she had a discussion in the case about how she turned down taking on big customers. What's the risk? You should learn by now from this class, from your readings and everything, we talk a lot in this course about the risk of grow. 

Well, the risk of having a dominant big customer is what we call customer concentration. What happens to your business if that customer leaves? Where are you? Because you have hired up, you have inventory, you are staffed to take care of a large volume, and that volume just goes, poof. Gone. 

Julie didn't want to run customer concentration risk. She wanted to grow in a measured way and she wanted to have no one customer have a large portion of her business. By that, Julie wanted to able to lose any one customer and not be in deep trouble. 

So, Julie faced people challenges. Controls, financial controls, quality controls, logistic controls. The technology, as the business grew, she had to put in place more technology. The logistics, how she would deliver. And wasn't it cool at the end when she said her husband put in this technology where everything just could be imprint, basically typed in one time, one time. And she was linked to UPS. She was linked to her inventory system. She was linked to her billing system. She was automated from a technology viewpoint.

But Julie never, in no business, ever solves the competition problem. Because, okay, honey attracts ants. If you're making money, competition is going to see it, and bigger competition saw the success that Julie was having and basically, what the case talks about are knock-offs. 

People started making glasses that looked pretty, not the same quality, and trying to undercut Julie's prices. And on page 13, Julie says, what this did was, it just put a whole different competition, put a whole different set of issues on my worry plate. Think about those words, my worry plate. 

Entrepreneurs always will have something on their worry plate. If you reach the point when you're building your business, of thinking, I've got it knocked, I've got it solved, I can now coast, ladies and gentlemen, that is the first step to your downfall because you will never reach that point. The fact is, there will always be something on your worry plate. 

Julie says, how do I stay ahead of the pack? I have to stay in front. I have to be more creative. I really worked hard. I want to look straight ahead, down, going forward, doing all the things that I can take my business forward. I want to constantly improve. I want to constantly go forward. 

A couple of CEO quotes. You don't want to bring on all the business that you can easily, growth can easily swallow you. Think of a big whale's mouth opening up and you're being swallowed. 

I talked in the beginning about the myths of growth, okay? All growth is not good. Bigger is not always better. You do not have to grow or die. All you have to do is increase your prices, your revenue by inflation, to make a living. 

I want you to be realistic about growth. Why? because you're more likely to succeed. Why? You're more likely to avoid the emotional and financial pain of making the obvious growth mistakes which many people make. 

## 1.3

Consistent above average growth is the exception. It is rare. There are six research studies, including one of mine, all of these are with public companies, okay? 

But the same thing really applies to private companies, alright, I believe. The reason we use public companies, we've got numbers. A lot of private business don't like to share numbers, okay? 

Those six studies basically state the likelihood that a public company will grow above industry averages, be above average, or above GDP averages for four years or longer is less than 10%.

The likelihood that a public company will grow seven years or more above industry averages or above GDP is less than 7%. In fact, it's less than 4%.

Growth doesn't mean more profits. You can grow your business and lose money. So, if you think about what Julie said, what does a business need to focus on? Cash. You want profitable growth. 

A lot of companies grow the top line and don't realize they're losing money. Every sale they make they're losing money. They can't pay their expenses. 

Now, one key point. To grow a business, that means you've got to have time to grow it. Time to hire people. Time to train people. Time to put in place processes. But in order to do that, it, growth requires excess, you got to have excess time. 

You got to have time to grow. You have to have time to do that or you have to hire a manager to manage what's going on now so you can grow the business. Growth is more likely to occur in spurts, okay? Growth doesn't happen in a linear fashion. 

I know a specific set of customers that I'm going to focus on like a laser, like a laser. Now, in order for me to grow my business and to make a living, that number, that customer segment needs to have a lot of customers. 

Because people are not going to buy from me in most businesses every day. So, what I want is a, a specific product for a specific customer segment that happens to have a lot of customers. Strategic focus. Strategic focus is critical. Consistent high performance growth business have operation excellence. What does that mean? It means three things, three things. 

- 99% defect free on-time delivery. 
- Every business is going to make  mistakes. Lovingly, caringly embrace your customer 
and make it right. 

We also know that high performance requires constant improvement. What does that mean? You're constantly practicing. You're constantly learning. You're constantly trying to get better, faster, or cheaper, okay? Better, faster, or cheaper, okay? 

Improvement. Better, faster, cheaper. You're practicing. You're learning. You're watering. You're irrigating. You're making your crops grow. 

Consistent high performance companies also are customer centric. Well, what it means is, your customer is more important than your product. Most entrepreneurs love their product, okay? Love your customer more than you love your product. 

As you grow a business, as Julie found, you can't be a high performance business unless you have high employee engagement. You have employees who care about your business and care about your customers like you do. 

They're engaged, they're loyal, they work hard, because somehow, you have made work meaningful for them. You are achieving your dreams while somehow, you're helping them achieve their dreams. 

What I'm telling you is is to understand and deal with the realities of growth. At a certain stage, depending on what industry you're in or what location you're in, at a certain stage as you grow, the competition is going to be bigger and better. 

But also, at some stage, you're going to become more bureaucratic and slower and you're going to bog down. And then, there may be someone like you used to be who comes forth with a better idea, a better proposition. 

You only have so much time. You have only so much money. You only have so many people. And you have to divide that time every day to growth, operations, maintenance, keep everything running, keep the train, so to speak, running on time, you have to worry about competition, okay? 

That's why you can't continuously just grow without taking care of operations and if you will, survival. In some species, growth requires so much energy it cannot occur, occur continuously but must alternate with periods of no growth. 

If you're continually growing, you will outrun your people capabilities, your processes, and controls, and then what happens? 

Quality issues, unhappy customers, financial issues, downward trend. And I learned this as I stated previously from entrepreneurs who imploded, blew up, self-destructed their own first company business because they didn't let up on the gas pedal. 

And they taught me this, okay? They taught me. What's fun about what I do, I get to learn from people. They taught me, let up on the gas pedal. If, besides the miss of growth, you learn one thing this week. The gas pedal approach to growth. 

## 1.4

Growth can destroy value if you don't manage growth properly. If you let growth outstrip your capacity to manage, or your controls, or your processes, or your people, bad things can happen. 

If you let it go on too long, you can lose your business you can lose your money. Some cases, you can also have real emotional distress. 

Point number two, growth should not be assumed. Don't buy into the false statement, companies grow or die. 

It's just not true. Rather it should be a decision made by you, weighing the pros and the cons of growing and not growing. The pros and con's of growing and not growing. That's what this is here, this scale. How does the scale tilt? A scale can tilt like that, it can tilt like that. 

It's important that you prioritize your time every day and understand that growth is expensive. In many cases if you're going to grow your business, you have to hire more people, buy more raw products, maybe rent more space. 

You have to pay out money before it comes in. You have to think that through. How much growth can you afford? How do you that? Because you do the numbers, okay? What's the timing of the outlays?

People don't want to basically come to work for you if you say, I want you to come to work for me. It's going to be a month before we get revenue from your work. So I'd like you to work for me a month free. 

How much growth can you afford? We've already talked about that growth can put you into a different, more competitive space. The game will change. Growth fundamentally changes everything, because when you grow, you will learn, okay? 

## 1.5

Why should we grow? How will we grow? How much should we grow? How much growth can we afford? Do we have enough people? Do we have the right people? Do we have hiring in training processes? Do we have adequate financial controls, adequate quality controls? Will growth create risk for our culture? 

The Growth Risk Assessment Tool is one of the key tools that I will leave you with in this entire course. 

So, you should, you can print out these questions. Why should we grow? That's an important question. Is it money? Is it to help people? Is it ego? 

Why? How will we grow? How will we get more customers? How much, will we grow? Do we want to double in size next month? I don't think so. How much do you want to grow over what period of time? How much growth can we afford? We've already talked about what that means. In order to grow, what do I have to do? What do I have to fix? What do I have to improve? What's it going to cost me? How many more people, okay? 

If I spend that money, how long is it going to take me to get new customers? How long is it going to take me to deliver my products? How long is it going to take me to get paid? What is the time frame between cash going out and cash coming in? Do I have enough money to afford to grow that much or do I have to pace it? 

Do I need more people? Do I have the right ones? Do I have good hiring processes? Most entrepreneurs when they grow their business learn, they are poor at hiring. In fact, one common theme from all my research, hire slowly, hire slowly, fire quickly if you make a mistake. 

Do I have financial controls? Do I know every day, every day, at the close of every day, how much money is in the bank, what my receivables, what my payables are. 

You need to know that every day. To have adequate quality controls, how do I know, as I ramp up, that my customers going to get good quality? What type of inspection controls, what type of check list do I have? What type of customer service follow through do I have? How do I know? 

Then, I have to ask myself a set of questions. Will growth create risk for my culture? Will adding a lot of people dilute my culture?What is your culture? What are the general rules, principles of how you want people to act? What are those unwritten rules to bind people together in the common cause that's meaningful? And if I had more people, how do I transmit, teach, educate that culture? 

We talked about customer service, customer experience, cash flow. If I grow, what about my supply chain? Can I get the raw materials? Can my supplier supply me? Will they work with me financially? Do I have the ability to distribute and deliver? 

Do I have a financial safety net if I'm wrong on my projections? I have never, ever had a projection or worked with a projection that a company ever met. Everyone always overestimates how fast and how much money is going to come in. What is your financial safety net? Okay. Once we say, okay, this could create some problems, what do I do to mitigate or reduce them? 

Do I have daily information? Do I have daily information to monitor them? How do I know if it's happening? Who is going to help me? Who is going to monitor, manage, and correct? 

## 1.7 (Eyebobs Interview)

Julie: Well, I think the first thing that comes to mind is do you want to own the entire grape or do you want to own a slice of the watermelon? If you want to own the entire grape it's not about raising capital. It's not about having investors. It's about focusing on the business and living and dying by your own sword. But I think you have to know what you're looking for when you start a business with regard to funding. 

Well to trust yourself. think one of the interesting that, sitting here trying to give advice, is don't take anybody's advice. Listen to what everybody has to say but be able to take that down and simmer it down yourself and follow your own instincts because if you're chasing somebody else's advice, you're always following this guy's advice and that woman's advice and that person's advice. You start to lose touch with what your true belief system is about your product or your service. 

The best people to listen to really are your customers. Not other people that have done it. But go and listen to your customers. If you think you have a niche product and something to sell, go and find out from people that are buying it. 

Well, I think my employees are really my greatest asset at this point. They know so much more about their, their jobs and our business. I couldn't possibly do it all myself. And they're really the experts at it. 

And you have to like and trust them. I think trust is a, is a big word because 
they're running your business. You're not in that customer service chair. You're not always in that shipping area. You're not always in that design phase by yourself. And you've got to have good people around you. 

And I think probably the hardest thing for me is some of those people that are really good at helping you start is as you get on your feet and you're growing and you get bigger, they're not always the right people to take you to the next level. 

It took me a long time to adjust to those ideas because I'm really loyal to my employees because I feel like I owe them a lot of Eyebob's success. But I, I really I try to surround myself with people that I like and trust. 

I think business is fun. So, I, I, I think it's it's the game of business. And I try to include them. We're trying to move more towards open book management in, in parts of our business so that they aren't just a cog in the wheel. 

And I think there's all sorts of fun in getting to know the business. And then there's, there are the social aspects of it. You know, for the first two years that I, I had Eyebobs open and was working at Eyebobs, I was by myself. And I really didn't enjoy working by myself. I am an extrovert. I need to bounce ideas off of people. 

And it's that kind of inclusion, I think, that makes the workplace more fun. get people to contribute in ways that maybe their jobs specifically doesn't ask for. 

And then, they kind of take it after that, you know, from, you can talk about casadia day and baked potato day.  People bringing in brownies and all those types of things, because that happens around here. 

I, I remember from the case and everything you, you told me when we were doing the case that I remember when you started out, it was, it was so lonely that you went to lunch a couple times a week with the mailman. 

What, what message does that send to your people if you're willing to share numbers with them? Alright, we're just starting to open that up right now. And I'm learning, that's something that I'm learning to do. 

These are the people I like and trust with my business. So, it's taking it to that next level. And you, you talked about the challenge and it's a difficult And that most entrepreneurs face and this is this, as you grow, it's what I call the upgrading problem. 

As you grow, you need better processes, better systems, and sometimes people that can take you to the next level but you've got very loyal people who got you to where, you know, to the level before and it's a, it's a real traumatic time for a lot, I mean for most entrepreneurs. And have you been able to basically, I'll use my friend, Jim Collins' terminology, have you been able to find them another seat on the bus? 

But I mean, how do you, how do you stay, how do you stay on the edge? Well, I think there are several things that feed my soul. One is travel and seeing how other people are running their businesses. Mm-hm. They're doing this, you know, at another company, and how does that idea fit in at Eyebobs, and that's where I get my energy from. Is trying to see what else is happening in the other, in other parts of the world. I don't look at other eyewear companies. I don't care what they're doing. It's how, how is the world moving? How are my customers moving? What are their expectations? What do they need? And that keeps my energy going. 

## 2.1

Because what I want you to think is Susan Feller, this nice woman, this retired guidance councellor, okay, who's built this little business and now is sort of overwhelmed with all her growth choices has come to you, John, Bob, Jane, Sue, all of you and said, I need your help. 

The unknown is scary, alright? Many times when you're building a business, you don't have all the answers. Things are uncertain, okay? And the first thing you do when you do that is, is what do I know? Then, the second question you ask yourself is, what do I really know?

Susan was a guidance counselor, a helper, but she loved cooking. And she loved making desserts. In the end, later in life, she contracted Celiac desease, which made it, made it impossible for her, without getting sick, to eat certain types of grains and flours. 

Why is that flour mixture so important? Because that's what she's got that's truly unique. That's what differentiates, she thinks her cakes and pastries and cookies from other gluten-free products. 

Because she bought all those in the stores and said, this is not as good as stuff I used to make. Her goal was to make the best gluten-free tasty desserts, pastries, cookies, etc. Alright. She made it. 
 
Now, the reason I'm going into to the details about Susan's story, ladies and gentlemen, it is a classic best practices of how one starts a business. You don't quit your day job, in most cases to start a business. You start your business small and you know what's the most important thing to do? 

Is to try and find customers who like what you're selling and then figure out where there's enough of them. She started baking in her home and Susan went out and went to grocery stores, natural foods grocery stores in the beginning. 

It took her almost a year to get approval to get into Whole Foods. Then, she makes the move to basically, why don't I go get a small space and she rented 2,400 square feet and she grew. She grew in order to meet the demand in the grocery store and she opened up a little retail bakery. 

And I was down there one morning about 10:00 and I'll tell you, ladies and gentlemen, everything looked so pretty. And Susan goes through and she picks up the German chocolate cake, the carrot cake, the cookies, okay, the lemon tart sand everything. 

She was what we used to call in the business the chief cook, bottle washer, and everything. She did all the accounts payable. She did all the accounts receivable. She bought all the products. She had part-time workers, okay? She built up to where, in the case, when we got to the end of the case, she had seven part-time bakers, okay, and helpers. She did the delivery. She was the salesperson. She's the one that went to each grocery to get customers. She delivered. She did everything.

You should have just said Julie because Susan believed in paying my bills with cash. Don't borrow money. When my bills come in, pay them very soon. 

It's going to make the point as to how you as a strategy consultant working with Susan have got in to get into the granular details because Susan didn't know what the real cost, per-unit cost were. 

What does that mean? What does per-unit cost mean? She didn't know whether that little lemon cake, which sells for 3.50, she didn't know whether it cost her $1.00 to make, $1.50 to make or $4.00 to make. She didn't know. 

Now, the Whole Foods' situation, basically, got her into the big leagues. And the case told you, she was operating currently at 70% capacity. 

Now, she made a couple of different kinds of products, didn't she? She made frozen cookie doughs, okay? She made, if you will, real-life pastries, cakes, and everything that have shelf lives. Why is this important? 

Susan, the entrepreneur. What are her strengths and weaknesses? What is she good at? What are her personal and business goals? What are her priorities?

Why, when you're making your growth decision for your business, do you need to sit back and do the same. What am I good at? What am I not good at? What do I enjoy doing? What do I not enjoy doing? What's my end-game? End-game, gain, what do I mean by that? 

What do I mean by end-game? Is it your ultimate goal? Do you want to be a large public company? Or do you want to earn so much money to live on? Do you want to have 50 employees? Do you want to be the number one provider of your product in your community in which you live? What's the end-game, why are you doing this? Now, most people want to grow a business because they think they have to. 

All you got to do is outcompete the competition. And you learned you don't have to grow, unless you want to grow. And understanding why you want to grow is critical to this whole analysis as what she should do. It's interesting. 

## 2.2

In many cases, entrepreneurs are trying to do good. But Susan had, in the back of her mind, a couple of primary reasons. Help people to build something that my sons could work together and build and make it into the dominant big gluten-free, all natural, certified bakery, okay? Helping people enjoy foods when they have celiac disease. An honorable, good goal. 

What was her strengths and weaknesses? She was an artist and a guidance counselor. What did she say she loved in the case? She loved baking beautiful desserts, cakes and she loved making them for. Weddings, birthdays. She said to me, when the joys in her life was one of the first birthday cakes she baked for a little boy who was celiac. It puts together her love of art and creativity, her love of giving as a guidance counselor and her love of solving the celiac problem. 

So what was her weaknesses? She didn't know accounting, she didn't know how to create business processes. Right? She didn't even know what her cost per unit was. And she really, didn't want to manage a big business. So she was sort of in a quandry, where her personal goals, were propelling her to get bigger and grow But, as she grew the business, she was playing not to her strengths, but to her weaknesses. And the other thing is, as she grew her business, and she was the lead sales person, okay. She grew her business, The more the business grew, the less time she had for making her beautiful cakes for weddings and birthdays which was her love, her passion. 

Did Susan have strategic focus? What do you think, she has strategic focus?  Should she have focused on frozen cookie doughs, because of long shelf life. Should she just focus on certain types of cakes, certain types of cookies. Or maybe should she just do the big cakes for the weddings, birthdays, that she likes to do every once in a while. And should she just make many individual serve deserts? This is what you'll face as you try to grow a business, lots of decisions. 

Did she have operational excellence? I put a question mark by this. Well, it depends how you define operational excellence, doesn't it? That's why she got, stayed in new crops. That's why she got into whole foods. She can make a good product, but what we don't know is, was she making those product's individually profitably. Because she didn't have processes that measured her per unit cost's. She didn't have real, an accounting system. 

Alright? She just had a file folder with accounts payable, accounts receivable. Okay. She didn't have sales strategy or sales process, she didn't have processes that she could basically used to teach other people. So, she was weak on process. 

So, she was weak on strategic focus, she was weak on operational excellence. Did she, was she customer centric? So she had customer centricity and she had high employee engagement. She had an issue of strategic focus, and she had an issue of operational assets. 

So, we, we talked about her strengths and weaknesses. We just talked about the businesses' strengths and weaknesses.

So what were her alternatives? Keep doing what she's doing. Improve and grow slowly. Number 2, expand into more Whole Foods stores. And expand the product lines in Whole Foods. 3, remember in the case, you had the idea. 

I make more money by selling retail than selling wholesale. But it's easier to sell wholesale. And grow a business, because that person can sell lots of pot. You're leveraging yourself. So she could have a wholesale distributor sell and deliver her products. 

And what we know is, successful entrepreneurs take small steps, not big risk. They do this, they don't do that, why? Because, when you face the unknown and you face uncertainty. You take small steps, and you learn as you go. 

## 2.3

When you're in unknown, uncertain situations don't bet the ranch or, putting another way, don't bet your house. Don't bet your family's well-being. Don't bet all your assets, small bets. Learning, we called it learning lunches here. 

Reject alternatives that are too risky and premature. You assess that by, what's two ways? What's the likelihood of it succeeding, probability of success, probability of success. And how big is the financial risk compared to your, your net worth. 

Premature alternatives. What does that mean? Well if you go back to the conversation we had. And what I'm trying to basically make the point. Are you ready to grow? What does Susan have to do before she can grow? What are the preconditions to growth? 

Well, Susan needs to determine the cost of per-unit production. She didn't know which of her products are profitable. She needs to make sure she's got control processes, quality and financial in place before. She needs some software to help her manage the business. Now these are not big things. And she needs more information from the customers about what they will buy. Focus on this, make small bets. Not this, not this pace growth, and prioritize.

Mike (MBA son) joined the biz. Mike sat back and the first thing he did was figure out what were our per-unit costs. He put in some accounting controls. He put in some inventory controls. He put in some quality controls. He went and talked to whole foods. He went and talked to wholesalers. He started exploring. 

And he decided the first thing we're going to do is expand throughout the Mid-Atlantic states in whole foods. And then he thought about, I can manufacture and expand manufacturing. In the current facility fact I can even add on but how do I expand distribution. So then he basically found out who distributed food, who was the distribution company, who had the trucks, who had the delivery people, who made deliveries to Whole Foods, to Ukrops to people he was selling to. 

And he hired them to deliver his products. So that just means that he and his people, his employees had to focus on production. And customer service. Going to see the buyer. Putting on displays in the stores. Alright? Getting new stores. So he basically outsourced or had someone else do the actual delivery.

He has moved deliberately, iteratively, and incrementally has grown the business; has increased the number of employees, has put in more processes while keeping family control of the business. 

Not doing the joint venture while keeping the family brand, Free Fellers, okay? And a couple of weeks ago I was in Whole Foods and I saw the little lemon tarts, the little chocolate tarts, the little pecan tarts and everything. My wife loves lemon tarts and chocolate tarts so I took home each one of them. 

She saw the brand and she said that's Susan and Mike. I said yes it is, and. As when I tasted them years ago, they were delicious. But there they are right there on that shelf, eye level in whole foods. Prime place. And Mike is working those relationships. So they are continuing to grow within their means while they are putting in place. 

People, processes, and controls; they'd been thinking strategically, disciplined, focused thinking. They used the growth risk toolbox. They had focused on scaling, manufacturing, sales, service; but distribution they outsourced. With their employees they have outsourced HR type processing. They now have software. They are going up the chain, ladies and gentleman. 

Growing a business is much more than just strategy. It's much more than just money. It's like helping Susan achieve her dreams. It's helping Mike. It's helping the customers have beautiful, tasty, wonderful food that doesn't cause their disease to act up. 

It's doing good, helping people achieve their dreams; and if you talk to entrepreneurs as to why they want to grow, what I found in my study is the following point. So many of them said to me. Money is not enough. There has to be more, because at some point, you have enough, but you still want to grow, and there's got to be a reason. 

Four P's. Planning for growth. Processes. Prioritization and pace. 

## 3.1

Planning, prioritization, pace and processes.

You learned that to basically be very good in business, you've gotta take care of customers and have operational excellence, and have high employee engagement. It's not just about money. Money is the result of lots of other things.

Smart growth emphasizes what, ladies and gentleman? That you need to respect
the power of growth, and you need to grow smartly.

You have to, basically, approach growth with planning and thinking about, what do I need to do? How do I control it? How do I make sure my customers are not going to experience disruption?

What you do when you're growing a business, you, as the entrepreneur, have to got to figure out, what mistakes do I focus on, and how do I teach, not punish? Because in order for people not to make the same mistakes again and again and again, they have to do what? They have to learn.

Running a business is a lot like farming. The research show entrepreneurs, and you know this if you're an entrepreneur, you work longer hours in your own business then you worked when you were working for someone else, because, you can't leave it. 

Managing an entreprenuerial business is constantly choosing which fires to fight, and after you put the fire out, leaving a fire extinguisher behind.

We set up as if we were a large company from the start. If you're planning, ultimately, to get big, maybe you have to do some things in the beginning.

Everyday I take out my piece of paper and I write my to do list, top priority, everyday. The first thing I do everyday, is the thing on the list that I dread the most or don't enjoy the most, or that's the hardest for me to do.

Give yourself an afternoon weekly, sometime, to think about the five critical things going on in your business, and make sure you're focused on the big opportunities or the big problems. I call that firehouse time.

Prioritization. I think this is mission-critical. And you learned, that with Susan Feller, the first thing she had to do was to prioritize her goals. Her goals, her values. And then that allows her to prioritize her growth alternatives.

Don't get involved in all the brush fires. Focused on the thing with the biggest impact, the biggest fire that could do the most harm.

_I do not pay you to get everything done everyday. I pay you to get the most important things done._

Here's the focus statement that we've had before, be two inches wide and two miles deep. Two inches wide, two miles deep. In a high-growth business, it's easy to get spread too thin, trying to be too many things to too many people.

Focus on the one thing you can do better than anyone else, and focus on a way to make it appealing to a big market. Lots of customers. Lots of customers. The big market. 

#### Process

Process is, is the how. So, I get 99% defect-free, on time, quality delivery. as the goal, and I reach it many days.

Processes are what you put in place to prevent errors, mistakes, variance. Okay? Variance. Processes is how you reduce mistakes. 

I do not want a single point of failure. What's that mean? That means, and this entreprenuer who said it, he said, every person, okay, must train someone else to do their job. 

The fire extinguisher. No single point of failure. Trust but verify. The more we focused and said no, the more we grew. Focus on doing one thing very, very well that's got a big market.

## 3.2

Interesting story. 1998. Dave starts his own business, uses $30,000 of his personal savings, and he goes through a process, over the last 23 years, of building a business today, which this year will do $400 million of revenue. 

And Dave concluded, as he looks back on it all, that businesses don't grow unless the people grow. And Dave also concluded, a business doesn't grow unless the entrepreneur grows. What do i mean by that? 

Growth takes more people. More people takes processes and controls. It sort of builds upon each other, okay? And when you have more people, then the entrepreur has to delegate.

So I go from entrepreneur, to manager, to leader, and ultimately, you get to where Dave is now, is you get to be coach and mentor.

Dave learned basically, the principle, alright, of wow, I need to have a repeatable system, that Dave called McDonaldized.

Building a business is like a giant jigsaw puzzle. I gotta have the right processes. I gotta have the right employees. I gotta have the right attitude about customers. I gotta care about customers.

That's what all this process is about. Because he's trained his people in the kitchen, and he's trained his waiters and waitresses, what are the critical things to say and do with every customer. So when they leave they feel that way, that's why this process stuff's important. We call it in business school, operations. Because it all comes in to play about how your costumer feels and whether your customer keeps coming back.

- The entrepreneur's job is to create the process.
- The manager's job is to ensure the process is used, and used correctly.
- And the technician, the doer, the employee, the installer in this case, job is to follow the process and use it.

We always remind ourselves, it's not okay to put in place a mom and pop system in place, because that's just going to keep us small forever. A big business is just a small business that got big.

And Dave is saying, put in place the processes that are going to allow you to grow if you choose to grow. Put in good processes, and you're constantly improving processes. And who is the person that will most likely come up with the ideas of how to improve the process and make it better? Your employees.

So make it part of their job descriptions, not only to use the process but to constantly improve the process. Because if you're constantly getting better, faster, and more efficient, you will outrun the bear.

The next thing Dave had to do, was he reached the point where he had to start prioritizing. He had to define his business. Why is this important? Because when you define who you are, that helps you determine what to focus on, and most importantly, what not to do.

Focus is critical in it all. So he had to define himself, so his employees knew, and he defined himself as a home installation product company.

By defining himself as the home installation, he said, I'm not going to do commercial or business installations. I'm going to the residential home owner. And that allowed him, as you read in the case to limit his products, to his limit his spare parts, to limit what his installers had to learn, so that they became very, very good.

Today we still have only 13 part numbers in our inventory room, the same 13 we had ten years ago. We have not added things. Wee kept doing more of the same, better, trying to McDonaldize it. We understood focus as the goal early on, constantly using an A, B, C format to prioritize. 

And at the top of the circle, the circle of life starts with marketing. You gotta do marketing to get sales. Okay? Then once you have sales, you've gotta install. Once you install, you gotta bill and collect. And then you start over.

In Dave's model, everything starts with marketing, and Dave used a bottle-neck priority approach to managing. Where is the bottle-neck? If it's in marketing, Dave is going into marketing, and overseeing it.

What's going on in sales? If I sell a lot, if I get a bottle-neck in installation, you remember in the case, he says they knew where the bottle-neck was by where I showed up everyday.

So everybody understood that everybody is dependent and interdependent on each other. Sales can't sell until they have leads from marketing. Installers can't install until sales are made. Billing and accounts payable and working with the customer, can't happen until it's installed. And unless it's all working, there's no
money coming in. 

And in order to do this, he also built an infrastructure, on the Defender Advantage, what he called, his culture. And you saw, basically, his whole cultural multi-year program of training and education.

And the sad point that Dave talks about in the case is, as you grow, sometimes your people can't take on more responsibility and they have to stay in the same position, okay? That's difficult in a business, especially when those employees are loyal employees who were there from the beginning and helped build your business, but it's one of the things you're going to have to face as you grow a business.

## 3.3

One of the key things in thinking about and planning your business and planning your growth is visualizing what your company will look like and visualizing the infrastructure.

And by that, what I mean by that is how much spac, what type of furniture, what type of supplies, what type of people? Alright? How you're going to do each business function? How you going to produce whatever you do? How you going to display it? How you going to deliver it? How you going to bill? How you going to collect? How you going to process your money? How you going to keep track of your money?


Every little detail, because as you build your business, you'll be building processes which is the infastructure, the wiring, the plumbing of your house, your business. Because, without the right infrastructure, at some point in time, the building will crumble.

If you've got 25 employees I would suggest to you, you've got some managers or team leaders or project leaders, people that are responsible for a group. And usually, as I say, usually organizations are built upon seven to nine people is the most someone can basically manage.

If you build your business big like Dave did, 1500 employees, okay? The direct reports that Dave should have is no more than seven.

Dave, he could manage a sales person, another sales person, he could have one installer, an installer's assistant, and then an admin and an accountant person. That's a simple start-up structure. 

The first one was structure, what I look like? The second one is, what do I need? The third is, what do I do myself versus what do I hire other people to do for me? Most entrepreneurs when they grow business, outsource, hire other people to do it for them.

Payroll processing, accounting, doing the taxes, they outsource HR benefit processing. There's companies that do this. Some people outsource manufacturing. Okay? And we saw, that's what Julie did, but, she figured out how to manage quality control.

In the beginning, Defender Direct outsourced the selling to the telemarketing company. They ended up selling and then the vendor just installed, that ultimately was brought in-house. You can outsource delivery.

Okay? So the questions you got are, whats my structure look like, and what is it? How many people can I manage before I need managers? How do I basically put in place the flexibility, stub my house? And what do I do I do directly versus what I outsource? 

## 3.4

The key question about strategic prioritization is your answer to the 3 W's.

__What am I going to sell?__ Okay? And Dave, remember, kept defining that. He's going to sell stuff that he can install in the home, because he's the worlds best installer in the house.

__To whom?__ Homeowners was Dave's answer. Julie's answer was people over 40 who are losing, if you will, their ability to read without having reading glasses.

__Why is someone going to buy from me?__ Why are they going to buy from me? Is it because of price? Is it because of quality? Is it because they are my brother or sister and they love me? Price, quality or maybe it's the customer
experience. 

Too many entrepreneurs think it's because I've got the best product or it's the greatest product.

Trash cans are full of good products or good software that people didn't want to buy, that they didn't need compellingly enough, because the entire purpose of your product of service is to solve somebody's problem, to make life easier for them, to meet a specific need, to reduce what the marketing people say, a customer pain point.

What fire do you put out first? Critical decision.

How do you prioritize? What can do the most damage to your business, to your brand, to your reputation, to your customers, and again, we're not talking about health, life, safety.

You don't eat if you don't sell. You don't sell if you don't have a customer. You don't have a customer unless you offer a good service or product. Now, that was her circle of life and that's pretty good.

Yeah, it comes out to the quality. service and product for her, because if I don't have that, I don't have the customer. If I don't have the customer, I don't eat. 

Another entrepreneur said it this way. Set up three or four priorities that take precedence over everything else. Ladies and gentlemen, manage cash flow, focus on customers and quality service, accelerate revenue growth, and all the rest, unless something is on fire, can wait.

So that entrepreneur said, I gotta make sure I can keep the doors open and pay my bills and pay my employees, focus every day on cash flow, know where my cash is. If I don't have happy customers and quality service, I don't have money, right? Revenue growth is more happy customer. Unless something's on fire, it can wait. 

Huddles, daily prioritization. Every day in every Ritz-Carlton Hotel in every city in the world, every shift, there is a huddle. And a huddle is when all the team members come together, all the employees, and every day, there's a discussion, a short discussion of a key principle, or value, or cultural point and they have 30 key points.

Many entrepreneurs have a morning huddle and set priorities. Some entrepreneurs have a morning huddle and an afternoon huddle. Here are the priorities for the day and the afternoon huddle is what worked, what didn't work, what got done, we need to do first thing tomorrow.

Many entrepreneurs, as they grow their business, post daily key performance metrics, so everyone knows what their company or business is doing, what their function is doing, if it's different teams, different production teams, what each team's doing.

## 3.5

What is that checklist? It's a process. You should have checklists for key processes, key actions, key to-dos, key ways of doing things in your business that people can check off.

And yes, you start out as the entrepreneur writing them, because you've already done that, but as you grow, you get your employees engaged and it's part of their job description.

## 3.6

Most entrepreneurs did not have good hiring processes, good onboarding processes, good review and firing processes, which means, what I found is, they hire too quickly and fire too slowly.

And every time you lose an employee in your small business, it creates real disruption, because it's hard to have relationships with customers, to have your employees have relationships with customers when your employees have high turnover.

## 3.7

Focus equals growth. And we are very cognizant of that at the vendor and that was the key to our growth. It's all about prioritization.

We've focused on a very limited number of hard numbers in our security business. Customers. And it's always Getting more specific and going deeper than it is going wide. And sometimes when we first get success we think it's an opportunity to go wide.

The second one, we get into strategy with businesses. We always talk about know thyself. A lot of times we get into these strategic planning meetings we get a little bit of success we have a couple good ideas.

Instead of talking about what we could do, what we should do, what we want to do, we need to talk about what are we good at already. What are we really good at and how do we just do a lot more of that and bless more people?

Businesses don't grow, people do and I remind every entrepreneur in the end its going to be about you people growing your people its more important than strategy we do forecast we write strategies, It seems like, as quick as we walk out the room, they quickly become extinct.

The who that we want to choose in our fast growing businesses, are people that want to grow. If you don't want to grow. Why would you work at a company that wants to grow? there's actually a barter that we've made with our employees over the years.

You want to grow, I want to grow. You want to become more marketable, I want to create your skills. I have nothing but your best interest in mind than to grow you. And, I'm going to create that kind of an environment. I know when I do that, you will grow my business.

And we have countless stories in Defender. Personal growth, that when someone grows their job becomes easier, they become better able to lead others.

And that leads to promoting from within, building a culture, this idea of always remember, the business isn't what grows. 

Another snippet I love to share with entrepreneurs is never pay anybody more than $100,000 a year without a personal referral. We don't spend a lot of time on Monster or whatever the current search engines are to hire people. For our big time jobs, those come to us through personal referrals.

We want to promote from within, when we need to go outside. I found that high performance people of big salaries , they don't have to look for jobs.

I learned this after awhile was to really look at bringing on people as an investment instead of an expense. And when you really do the math, we start talking about these $100,000 a year people or, or You know it's not a $100,000 investment to hire that kind of person. It's really a $30,000 investment right?

When you change your mentality, and it becomes an investment game, that's where you really grow. This investment in leaders is an investment.
