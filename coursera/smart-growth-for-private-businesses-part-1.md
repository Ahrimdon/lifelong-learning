The Eyebob's glasses or it's fuddy-duddy  glasses.  Alright, that's what Eyedobs, Eyebobs  builds, ladies and gentlemen,  they manufacture fashion high quality  reading glasses. 

And the Eyebobs story is the story of Julie Allinson. Wasn't this a fascinating read?  A fascinating story, okay?  Here is a woman, okay, that really late  in life, decided she wanted to start a business. 

But the first point Julie makes is, is how she didn't want to borrow money from a bank when she started her business. She didn't want to have investors. Most people think about, wow, I need to go get investors or maybe I need to, to borrow money. But Julie said, no, I didn't want to do  that. 

If you have, if you owe banks money or you owe investors money, what do you have by definition? Your bank is your" partner". Your friends are your partner. But what do they really want to know? How much money are we making, when I'm going to get my money back plus my profit? 

Julie said, I didn't want anybody beating on my back, grow faster, grow faster. I wanted to be comfortable with it. I wanted to make the decisions, not someone else pushing me to make decisions. 

I happen to love the point that Julie makes the analogy between entrepreneurship and farmers. What do farmers do everyday? In season, they get up and they go out and work sunup to sundown. Some days they plow, some days they fertilize, some days they water, some days they pull weeds, some days they harvest. Some days they plow under and then, some days they start all over. 

Well, ladies and gentlemen, growing a business is just like farming. Sunup to sundown and basically some days, you're fixing mistakes, plowing under, some days you're building the platform, building the processes, teaching, training the people. 

Some days you're out there planting seeds, calling own customers. Every day you go to the business and every day you must work on the business. 

And one interesting, when she said on page two, I didn't want to live that type of life but I ended up just like them, being a entrepreneur. 

She goes into quite detail about what was the process of starting her company. because the reason I want to go into this, even though it's before she grew a business, it shows you the type of homework that's required even if you try to grow your company. 

You have to think through. How am I going to manufacture more? How am I going to sell more? How am I going to deliver more? How do I keep my quality? And Julie, okay, remember, used her own money, she bootstrapped, she bootstrapped. 

She basically says, how do I manufacture? What did she do? She went to China and she visited 24 manufacturers. And she learned, she learned how they do it.

Why did she go? Because she wanted to see for herself, because she's going to be back in Minnesota, she wanted to see who would manufacture her glasses. 

What role and how big she had to be until she got top spot, top quality? Was she going to be important to these people? Were they going to give her the best quality workers? Were they going to give her the best quality raw materials? 

She went and put her boots on the ground. She did her homework. And what she learned was the best quality, the best quality ingredients came from Italy. And now, we're talking really about this concept here of manufacturing the product. It came from Italy. 

What did she do? She went to Italy, she went to Italy. And she met the people in Italy. And she learned a very important lesson. If I want people to take me seriously and to care about my product, I need to personalize it. 

Business is really all about people, ladies and gentleman. It's people making stuff for people, selling stuff to people, taking care of people, hiring people. so you can grow and do more. Business is a people business, most businesses. 

She went and she found a manufacturer in Italy, okay, who not only had the best quality materials, just like used in the high fashion Italian eyewear, but they had manufacturing plants in China and they agreed to take on her business. Hard work and some luck basically helped Julie solve her manufacturing problem. 

How does she get customers?  What's the obvious question? Let's go to opticians.She went toopticians. Now, an optician, how does an optician make money? Sell the most profitable which usually, in this case, is the most expensive glasses. What happened? The opticians put them under the shelf because they'd rather sell you the expensive ones first. 

And then, when they didn't want to lose a sale, they brought out Julie's. It took Julie a while to learn this, ladies and gentlemen. 

Then, she was at a loss. Julie's breakthrough came in a men's store in Minneapolis, a men's store that sells like sport coats, shirts, to men. And she went to the owner and he says, Julie I've tried to sell lots of things and nothing has worked. But because you're local, you're one of us, I'll try it. 

Julie is selling women's fashion, quality reading glasses in a men's store. Who's buying them? The women that come in either with children, sons, husbands, or men who want to take a gift home. 

So, Julie said whoo, I've got to find more men's stores and what did she do? The owner of the men's store said, Julie you should go to a fashion men's stores trade show, which is a big convention of people like me in New York. 

She found out that all the sales reps for the, loved the glasses. In fact, she sold a lot of them to the sales reps. But she didn't sell a lot to the stores. She went back again the next show and those same sales reps came back and they bought for their clients because they had used the glasses or loved ones had used the glasses or friends had used the glasses and the glasses were high quality. 

Julie grew her business. First, she had to find the right manufacturing and then she had to find the right distribution channel. The right road to, if you will, the right road to the customer and it's this distribution channel, okay? 

Now, with this growth, came some issues, didn't it? Julie talked about in the case how she 
basically started her business and hired two, three people, hourly workers, answered the phone, do customer service, do the accounting, do the administrating. 

Julie wanted the glasses shipped from China to Minneapolis so she could inspect them all. She wanted to keep control of quality control because she knew a bad pair of glasses was bad for business. She wanted to keep control of actually the shipping, so she knew when it was going to get to her customer. Julie, in lots of ways, okay, knew what to keep control of, alright? Control of that customer contract and control ultimately of that quality control function. 

When you're growing your business and you start adding people, you, the entrepreneur, always keep control of the money. No one writes checks but you in the beginning. No one charges anything but you in the beginning. You have to control the money. 

Why? Because money is the lifeblood of the business circulatory system. If you get out of whack on money, you either got to go ask people for money, borrow against your house, go into your savings account, go into your kids' college account. 

You got to basically know where you are every day with money. Remember, in the case Julie said, cash flow is king. 

Now, Julie, okay, now faced her first people issues, challenges. And what did she do? She did what we call upgrading. Julie upgraded and went and found experienced people, two of them, in fact. And she got very fortunate, In fact, she was lucky. 

Most people do not make great hires the first time. Because of Julie's prior experience, she had experience, she had learned how to interview people, how to have hiring processes. 

Growth requires you to put in processes, remember? Growth stresses people processes and controls. Julie knew how to hire people, how to interview people, how to onboard people. And she found Kim and Saul. Both who came with lots of experience. 

And then Julie did something else that few entrepreneurs or many entrepreneurs find it hard to do. She was very honest, Julie, about what she was good at and what she was not good at. 

And she learned that I love design. I love, if you will, selling. I'm not good at customer service. I don't handle phone customers calling in really complaining. It's hard for me to act the way I need to act because all I want to do is interrupt and solve the problem. 

Kim was a professional at that. Kim added value to Julie, Julie's business because she complimented her. Saul had experience in a big department store. He knew distribution, logistics, and modernized at all. Julie, also at the time, put in some technology. 

As you learned in the case, her husband, new technology. And he did it part-time. But then, as you learned in the case as the business grew, Julie's husband came to work full-time to be in charge of accounting, because he was a CPA, and technology. 

Julie went from one employee to three, four employees, counting herself, back to one employee, added Kim, Saul, and her husband, and then grew as you know from four to eighteen employees in an iterative fashion as her business grew. 

Julie says, on page eleven, unmanaged growth could easily swallow you up. She had this fear of losing control because if she lost control, bad eyewear would get out there and what hurts you in business? 

Bad customer reputation, bad customer references, okay? That hurts you more than anything. She also was very, very selective about who her customers were going to be. She says, I only want customers that can pay me. I just don't want to sell glasses on credit to retailers. I want to sell them to the right people who can pay me on time. 

And notice how she had a discussion in the case about how she turned down taking on big customers. What's the risk? You should learn by now from this class, from your readings and everything, we talk a lot in this course about the risk of grow. 

Well, the risk of having a dominant big customer is what we call customer concentration. What happens to your business if that customer leaves? Where are you? Because you have hired up, you have inventory, you are staffed to take care of a large volume, and that volume just goes, poof. Gone. 

Julie didn't want to run customer concentration risk. She wanted to grow in a measured way and she wanted to have no one customer have a large portion of her business. By that, Julie wanted to able to lose any one customer and not be in deep trouble. 

So, Julie faced people challenges. Controls, financial controls, quality controls, logistic controls. The technology, as the business grew, she had to put in place more technology. The logistics, how she would deliver. And wasn't it cool at the end when she said her husband put in this technology where everything just could be imprint, basically typed in one time, one time. And she was linked to UPS. She was linked to her inventory system. She was linked to her billing system. She was automated from a technology viewpoint.

But Julie never, in no business, ever solves the competition problem. Because, okay, honey attracts ants. If you're making money, competition is going to see it, and bigger competition saw the success that Julie was having and basically, what the case talks about are knock-offs. 

People started making glasses that looked pretty, not the same quality, and trying to undercut Julie's prices. And on page 13, Julie says, what this did was, it just put a whole different competition, put a whole different set of issues on my worry plate. Think about those words, my worry plate. 

Entrepreneurs always will have something on their worry plate. If you reach the point when you're building your business, of thinking, I've got it knocked, I've got it solved, I can now coast, ladies and gentlemen, that is the first step to your downfall because you will never reach that point. The fact is, there will always be something on your worry plate. 

Julie says, how do I stay ahead of the pack? I have to stay in front. I have to be more creative. I really worked hard. I want to look straight ahead, down, going forward, doing all the things that I can take my business forward. I want to constantly improve. I want to constantly go forward. 

A couple of CEO quotes. You don't want to bring on all the business that you can easily, growth can easily swallow you. Think of a big whale's mouth opening up and you're being swallowed. 

I talked in the beginning about the myths of growth, okay? All growth is not good. Bigger is not always better. You do not have to grow or die. All you have to do is increase your prices, your revenue by inflation, to make a living. 

I want you to be realistic about growth. Why? because you're more likely to succeed. Why? You're more likely to avoid the emotional and financial pain of making the obvious growth mistakes which many people make. 

## 1.3

Consistent above average growth is the exception. It is rare. There are six research studies, including one of mine, all of these are with public companies, okay? 

But the same thing really applies to private companies, alright, I believe. The reason we use public companies, we've got numbers. A lot of private business don't like to share numbers, okay? 

Those six studies basically state the likelihood that a public company will grow above industry averages, be above average, or above GDP averages for four years or longer is less than 10%.

The likelihood that a public company will grow seven years or more above industry averages or above GDP is less than 7%. In fact, it's less than 4%.

Growth doesn't mean more profits. You can grow your business and lose money. So, if you think about what Julie said, what does a business need to focus on? Cash. You want profitable growth. 

A lot of companies grow the top line and don't realize they're losing money. Every sale they make they're losing money. They can't pay their expenses. 

Now, one key point. To grow a business, that means you've got to have time to grow it. Time to hire people. Time to train people. Time to put in place processes. But in order to do that, it, growth requires excess, you got to have excess time. 

You got to have time to grow. You have to have time to do that or you have to hire a manager to manage what's going on now so you can grow the business. Growth is more likely to occur in spurts, okay? Growth doesn't happen in a linear fashion. 

I know a specific set of customers that I'm going to focus on like a laser, like a laser. Now, in order for me to grow my business and to make a living, that number, that customer segment needs to have a lot of customers. 

Because people are not going to buy from me in most businesses every day. So, what I want is a, a specific product for a specific customer segment that happens to have a lot of customers. Strategic focus. Strategic focus is critical. Consistent high performance growth business have operation excellence. What does that mean? It means three things, three things. 

- 99% defect free on-time delivery. 
- Every business is going to make  mistakes. Lovingly, caringly embrace your customer 
and make it right. 

We also know that high performance requires constant improvement. What does that mean? You're constantly practicing. You're constantly learning. You're constantly trying to get better, faster, or cheaper, okay? Better, faster, or cheaper, okay? 

Improvement. Better, faster, cheaper. You're practicing. You're learning. You're watering. You're irrigating. You're making your crops grow. 

Consistent high performance companies also are customer centric. Well, what it means is, your customer is more important than your product. Most entrepreneurs love their product, okay? Love your customer more than you love your product. 

As you grow a business, as Julie found, you can't be a high performance business unless you have high employee engagement. You have employees who care about your business and care about your customers like you do. 

They're engaged, they're loyal, they work hard, because somehow, you have made work meaningful for them. You are achieving your dreams while somehow, you're helping them achieve their dreams. 

What I'm telling you is is to understand and deal with the realities of growth. At a certain stage, depending on what industry you're in or what location you're in, at a certain stage as you grow, the competition is going to be bigger and better. 

But also, at some stage, you're going to become more bureaucratic and slower and you're going to bog down. And then, there may be someone like you used to be who comes forth with a better idea, a better proposition. 

You only have so much time. You have only so much money. You only have so many people. And you have to divide that time every day to growth, operations, maintenance, keep everything running, keep the train, so to speak, running on time, you have to worry about competition, okay? 

That's why you can't continuously just grow without taking care of operations and if you will, survival. In some species, growth requires so much energy it cannot occur, occur continuously but must alternate with periods of no growth. 

If you're continually growing, you will outrun your people capabilities, your processes, and controls, and then what happens? 

Quality issues, unhappy customers, financial issues, downward trend. And I learned this as I stated previously from entrepreneurs who imploded, blew up, self-destructed their own first company business because they didn't let up on the gas pedal. 

And they taught me this, okay? They taught me. What's fun about what I do, I get to learn from people. They taught me, let up on the gas pedal. If, besides the miss of growth, you learn one thing this week. The gas pedal approach to growth. 

## 1.4

Growth can destroy value if you don't manage growth properly. If you let growth outstrip your capacity to manage, or your controls, or your processes, or your people, bad things can happen. 

If you let it go on too long, you can lose your business you can lose your money. Some cases, you can also have real emotional distress. 

Point number two, growth should not be assumed. Don't buy into the false statement, companies grow or die. 

It's just not true. Rather it should be a decision made by you, weighing the pros and the cons of growing and not growing. The pros and con's of growing and not growing. That's what this is here, this scale. How does the scale tilt? A scale can tilt like that, it can tilt like that. 

It's important that you prioritize your time every day and understand that growth is expensive. In many cases if you're going to grow your business, you have to hire more people, buy more raw products, maybe rent more space. 

You have to pay out money before it comes in. You have to think that through. How much growth can you afford? How do you that? Because you do the numbers, okay? What's the timing of the outlays?

People don't want to basically come to work for you if you say, I want you to come to work for me. It's going to be a month before we get revenue from your work. So I'd like you to work for me a month free. 

How much growth can you afford? We've already talked about that growth can put you into a different, more competitive space. The game will change. Growth fundamentally changes everything, because when you grow, you will learn, okay? 

## 1.5

Why should we grow? How will we grow? How much should we grow? How much growth can we afford? Do we have enough people? Do we have the right people? Do we have hiring in training processes? Do we have adequate financial controls, adequate quality controls? Will growth create risk for our culture? 

The Growth Risk Assessment Tool is one of the key tools that I will leave you with in this entire course. 

So, you should, you can print out these questions. Why should we grow? That's an important question. Is it money? Is it to help people? Is it ego? 

Why? How will we grow? How will we get more customers? How much, will we grow? Do we want to double in size next month? I don't think so. How much do you want to grow over what period of time? How much growth can we afford? We've already talked about what that means. In order to grow, what do I have to do? What do I have to fix? What do I have to improve? What's it going to cost me? How many more people, okay? 

If I spend that money, how long is it going to take me to get new customers? How long is it going to take me to deliver my products? How long is it going to take me to get paid? What is the time frame between cash going out and cash coming in? Do I have enough money to afford to grow that much or do I have to pace it? 

Do I need more people? Do I have the right ones? Do I have good hiring processes? Most entrepreneurs when they grow their business learn, they are poor at hiring. In fact, one common theme from all my research, hire slowly, hire slowly, fire quickly if you make a mistake. 

Do I have financial controls? Do I know every day, every day, at the close of every day, how much money is in the bank, what my receivables, what my payables are. 

You need to know that every day. To have adequate quality controls, how do I know, as I ramp up, that my customers going to get good quality? What type of inspection controls, what type of check list do I have? What type of customer service follow through do I have? How do I know? 

Then, I have to ask myself a set of questions. Will growth create risk for my culture? Will adding a lot of people dilute my culture?What is your culture? What are the general rules, principles of how you want people to act? What are those unwritten rules to bind people together in the common cause that's meaningful? And if I had more people, how do I transmit, teach, educate that culture? 

We talked about customer service, customer experience, cash flow. If I grow, what about my supply chain? Can I get the raw materials? Can my supplier supply me? Will they work with me financially? Do I have the ability to distribute and deliver? 

Do I have a financial safety net if I'm wrong on my projections? I have never, ever had a projection or worked with a projection that a company ever met. Everyone always overestimates how fast and how much money is going to come in. What is your financial safety net? Okay. Once we say, okay, this could create some problems, what do I do to mitigate or reduce them? 

Do I have daily information? Do I have daily information to monitor them? How do I know if it's happening? Who is going to help me? Who is going to monitor, manage, and correct?
