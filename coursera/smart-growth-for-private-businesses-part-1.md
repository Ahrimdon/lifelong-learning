The Eyebob's glasses or it's fuddy-duddy  glasses.  Alright, that's what Eyedobs, Eyebobs  builds, ladies and gentlemen,  they manufacture fashion high quality  reading glasses. 

And the Eyebobs story is the story of Julie Allinson. Wasn't this a fascinating read?  A fascinating story, okay?  Here is a woman, okay, that really late  in life, decided she wanted to start a business. 

But the first point Julie makes is, is how she didn't want to borrow money from a bank when she started her business. She didn't want to have investors. Most people think about, wow, I need to go get investors or maybe I need to, to borrow money. But Julie said, no, I didn't want to do  that. 

If you have, if you owe banks money or you owe investors money, what do you have by definition? Your bank is your" partner". Your friends are your partner. But what do they really want to know? How much money are we making, when I'm going to get my money back plus my profit? 

Julie said, I didn't want anybody beating on my back, grow faster, grow faster. I wanted to be comfortable with it. I wanted to make the decisions, not someone else pushing me to make decisions. 

I happen to love the point that Julie makes the analogy between entrepreneurship and farmers. What do farmers do everyday? In season, they get up and they go out and work sunup to sundown. Some days they plow, some days they fertilize, some days they water, some days they pull weeds, some days they harvest. Some days they plow under and then, some days they start all over. 

Well, ladies and gentlemen, growing a business is just like farming. Sunup to sundown and basically some days, you're fixing mistakes, plowing under, some days you're building the platform, building the processes, teaching, training the people. 

Some days you're out there planting seeds, calling own customers. Every day you go to the business and every day you must work on the business. 

And one interesting, when she said on page two, I didn't want to live that type of life but I ended up just like them, being a entrepreneur. 

She goes into quite detail about what was the process of starting her company. because the reason I want to go into this, even though it's before she grew a business, it shows you the type of homework that's required even if you try to grow your company. 

You have to think through. How am I going to manufacture more? How am I going to sell more? How am I going to deliver more? How do I keep my quality? And Julie, okay, remember, used her own money, she bootstrapped, she bootstrapped. 

She basically says, how do I manufacture? What did she do? She went to China and she visited 24 manufacturers. And she learned, she learned how they do it.

Why did she go? Because she wanted to see for herself, because she's going to be back in Minnesota, she wanted to see who would manufacture her glasses. 

What role and how big she had to be until she got top spot, top quality? Was she going to be important to these people? Were they going to give her the best quality workers? Were they going to give her the best quality raw materials? 

She went and put her boots on the ground. She did her homework. And what she learned was the best quality, the best quality ingredients came from Italy. And now, we're talking really about this concept here of manufacturing the product. It came from Italy. 

What did she do? She went to Italy, she went to Italy. And she met the people in Italy. And she learned a very important lesson. If I want people to take me seriously and to care about my product, I need to personalize it. 

Business is really all about people, ladies and gentleman. It's people making stuff for people, selling stuff to people, taking care of people, hiring people. so you can grow and do more. Business is a people business, most businesses. 

She went and she found a manufacturer in Italy, okay, who not only had the best quality materials, just like used in the high fashion Italian eyewear, but they had manufacturing plants in China and they agreed to take on her business. Hard work and some luck basically helped Julie solve her manufacturing problem. 

How does she get customers?  What's the obvious question? Let's go to opticians.She went toopticians. Now, an optician, how does an optician make money? Sell the most profitable which usually, in this case, is the most expensive glasses. What happened? The opticians put them under the shelf because they'd rather sell you the expensive ones first. 

And then, when they didn't want to lose a sale, they brought out Julie's. It took Julie a while to learn this, ladies and gentlemen. 

Then, she was at a loss. Julie's breakthrough came in a men's store in Minneapolis, a men's store that sells like sport coats, shirts, to men. And she went to the owner and he says, Julie I've tried to sell lots of things and nothing has worked. But because you're local, you're one of us, I'll try it. 

Julie is selling women's fashion, quality reading glasses in a men's store. Who's buying them? The women that come in either with children, sons, husbands, or men who want to take a gift home. 

So, Julie said whoo, I've got to find more men's stores and what did she do? The owner of the men's store said, Julie you should go to a fashion men's stores trade show, which is a big convention of people like me in New York. 

She found out that all the sales reps for the, loved the glasses. In fact, she sold a lot of them to the sales reps. But she didn't sell a lot to the stores. She went back again the next show and those same sales reps came back and they bought for their clients because they had used the glasses or loved ones had used the glasses or friends had used the glasses and the glasses were high quality. 

Julie grew her business. First, she had to find the right manufacturing and then she had to find the right distribution channel. The right road to, if you will, the right road to the customer and it's this distribution channel, okay? 

Now, with this growth, came some issues, didn't it? Julie talked about in the case how she 
basically started her business and hired two, three people, hourly workers, answered the phone, do customer service, do the accounting, do the administrating. 

Julie wanted the glasses shipped from China to Minneapolis so she could inspect them all. She wanted to keep control of quality control because she knew a bad pair of glasses was bad for business. She wanted to keep control of actually the shipping, so she knew when it was going to get to her customer. Julie, in lots of ways, okay, knew what to keep control of, alright? Control of that customer contract and control ultimately of that quality control function. 

When you're growing your business and you start adding people, you, the entrepreneur, always keep control of the money. No one writes checks but you in the beginning. No one charges anything but you in the beginning. You have to control the money. 

Why? Because money is the lifeblood of the business circulatory system. If you get out of whack on money, you either got to go ask people for money, borrow against your house, go into your savings account, go into your kids' college account. 

You got to basically know where you are every day with money. Remember, in the case Julie said, cash flow is king. 

Now, Julie, okay, now faced her first people issues, challenges. And what did she do? She did what we call upgrading. Julie upgraded and went and found experienced people, two of them, in fact. And she got very fortunate, In fact, she was lucky. 

Most people do not make great hires the first time. Because of Julie's prior experience, she had experience, she had learned how to interview people, how to have hiring processes. 

Growth requires you to put in processes, remember? Growth stresses people processes and controls. Julie knew how to hire people, how to interview people, how to onboard people. And she found Kim and Saul. Both who came with lots of experience. 

And then Julie did something else that few entrepreneurs or many entrepreneurs find it hard to do. She was very honest, Julie, about what she was good at and what she was not good at. 

And she learned that I love design. I love, if you will, selling. I'm not good at customer service. I don't handle phone customers calling in really complaining. It's hard for me to act the way I need to act because all I want to do is interrupt and solve the problem. 

Kim was a professional at that. Kim added value to Julie, Julie's business because she complimented her. Saul had experience in a big department store. He knew distribution, logistics, and modernized at all. Julie, also at the time, put in some technology. 

As you learned in the case, her husband, new technology. And he did it part-time. But then, as you learned in the case as the business grew, Julie's husband came to work full-time to be in charge of accounting, because he was a CPA, and technology. 

Julie went from one employee to three, four employees, counting herself, back to one employee, added Kim, Saul, and her husband, and then grew as you know from four to eighteen employees in an iterative fashion as her business grew. 

Julie says, on page eleven, unmanaged growth could easily swallow you up. She had this fear of losing control because if she lost control, bad eyewear would get out there and what hurts you in business? 

Bad customer reputation, bad customer references, okay? That hurts you more than anything. She also was very, very selective about who her customers were going to be. She says, I only want customers that can pay me. I just don't want to sell glasses on credit to retailers. I want to sell them to the right people who can pay me on time. 

And notice how she had a discussion in the case about how she turned down taking on big customers. What's the risk? You should learn by now from this class, from your readings and everything, we talk a lot in this course about the risk of grow. 

Well, the risk of having a dominant big customer is what we call customer concentration. What happens to your business if that customer leaves? Where are you? Because you have hired up, you have inventory, you are staffed to take care of a large volume, and that volume just goes, poof. Gone. 

Julie didn't want to run customer concentration risk. She wanted to grow in a measured way and she wanted to have no one customer have a large portion of her business. By that, Julie wanted to able to lose any one customer and not be in deep trouble. 

So, Julie faced people challenges. Controls, financial controls, quality controls, logistic controls. The technology, as the business grew, she had to put in place more technology. The logistics, how she would deliver. And wasn't it cool at the end when she said her husband put in this technology where everything just could be imprint, basically typed in one time, one time. And she was linked to UPS. She was linked to her inventory system. She was linked to her billing system. She was automated from a technology viewpoint.

But Julie never, in no business, ever solves the competition problem. Because, okay, honey attracts ants. If you're making money, competition is going to see it, and bigger competition saw the success that Julie was having and basically, what the case talks about are knock-offs. 

People started making glasses that looked pretty, not the same quality, and trying to undercut Julie's prices. And on page 13, Julie says, what this did was, it just put a whole different competition, put a whole different set of issues on my worry plate. Think about those words, my worry plate. 

Entrepreneurs always will have something on their worry plate. If you reach the point when you're building your business, of thinking, I've got it knocked, I've got it solved, I can now coast, ladies and gentlemen, that is the first step to your downfall because you will never reach that point. The fact is, there will always be something on your worry plate. 

Julie says, how do I stay ahead of the pack? I have to stay in front. I have to be more creative. I really worked hard. I want to look straight ahead, down, going forward, doing all the things that I can take my business forward. I want to constantly improve. I want to constantly go forward. 

A couple of CEO quotes. You don't want to bring on all the business that you can easily, growth can easily swallow you. Think of a big whale's mouth opening up and you're being swallowed. 

I talked in the beginning about the myths of growth, okay? All growth is not good. Bigger is not always better. You do not have to grow or die. All you have to do is increase your prices, your revenue by inflation, to make a living. 

I want you to be realistic about growth. Why? because you're more likely to succeed. Why? You're more likely to avoid the emotional and financial pain of making the obvious growth mistakes which many people make. 

## 1.3

Consistent above average growth is the exception. It is rare. There are six research studies, including one of mine, all of these are with public companies, okay? 

But the same thing really applies to private companies, alright, I believe. The reason we use public companies, we've got numbers. A lot of private business don't like to share numbers, okay? 

Those six studies basically state the likelihood that a public company will grow above industry averages, be above average, or above GDP averages for four years or longer is less than 10%.

The likelihood that a public company will grow seven years or more above industry averages or above GDP is less than 7%. In fact, it's less than 4%.

Growth doesn't mean more profits. You can grow your business and lose money. So, if you think about what Julie said, what does a business need to focus on? Cash. You want profitable growth. 

A lot of companies grow the top line and don't realize they're losing money. Every sale they make they're losing money. They can't pay their expenses. 

Now, one key point. To grow a business, that means you've got to have time to grow it. Time to hire people. Time to train people. Time to put in place processes. But in order to do that, it, growth requires excess, you got to have excess time. 

You got to have time to grow. You have to have time to do that or you have to hire a manager to manage what's going on now so you can grow the business. Growth is more likely to occur in spurts, okay? Growth doesn't happen in a linear fashion. 

I know a specific set of customers that I'm going to focus on like a laser, like a laser. Now, in order for me to grow my business and to make a living, that number, that customer segment needs to have a lot of customers. 

Because people are not going to buy from me in most businesses every day. So, what I want is a, a specific product for a specific customer segment that happens to have a lot of customers. Strategic focus. Strategic focus is critical. Consistent high performance growth business have operation excellence. What does that mean? It means three things, three things. 

- 99% defect free on-time delivery. 
- Every business is going to make  mistakes. Lovingly, caringly embrace your customer 
and make it right. 

We also know that high performance requires constant improvement. What does that mean? You're constantly practicing. You're constantly learning. You're constantly trying to get better, faster, or cheaper, okay? Better, faster, or cheaper, okay? 

Improvement. Better, faster, cheaper. You're practicing. You're learning. You're watering. You're irrigating. You're making your crops grow. 

Consistent high performance companies also are customer centric. Well, what it means is, your customer is more important than your product. Most entrepreneurs love their product, okay? Love your customer more than you love your product. 

As you grow a business, as Julie found, you can't be a high performance business unless you have high employee engagement. You have employees who care about your business and care about your customers like you do. 

They're engaged, they're loyal, they work hard, because somehow, you have made work meaningful for them. You are achieving your dreams while somehow, you're helping them achieve their dreams. 

What I'm telling you is is to understand and deal with the realities of growth. At a certain stage, depending on what industry you're in or what location you're in, at a certain stage as you grow, the competition is going to be bigger and better. 

But also, at some stage, you're going to become more bureaucratic and slower and you're going to bog down. And then, there may be someone like you used to be who comes forth with a better idea, a better proposition. 

You only have so much time. You have only so much money. You only have so many people. And you have to divide that time every day to growth, operations, maintenance, keep everything running, keep the train, so to speak, running on time, you have to worry about competition, okay? 

That's why you can't continuously just grow without taking care of operations and if you will, survival. In some species, growth requires so much energy it cannot occur, occur continuously but must alternate with periods of no growth. 

If you're continually growing, you will outrun your people capabilities, your processes, and controls, and then what happens? 

Quality issues, unhappy customers, financial issues, downward trend. And I learned this as I stated previously from entrepreneurs who imploded, blew up, self-destructed their own first company business because they didn't let up on the gas pedal. 

And they taught me this, okay? They taught me. What's fun about what I do, I get to learn from people. They taught me, let up on the gas pedal. If, besides the miss of growth, you learn one thing this week. The gas pedal approach to growth. 

## 1.4

Growth can destroy value if you don't manage growth properly. If you let growth outstrip your capacity to manage, or your controls, or your processes, or your people, bad things can happen. 

If you let it go on too long, you can lose your business you can lose your money. Some cases, you can also have real emotional distress. 

Point number two, growth should not be assumed. Don't buy into the false statement, companies grow or die. 

It's just not true. Rather it should be a decision made by you, weighing the pros and the cons of growing and not growing. The pros and con's of growing and not growing. That's what this is here, this scale. How does the scale tilt? A scale can tilt like that, it can tilt like that. 

It's important that you prioritize your time every day and understand that growth is expensive. In many cases if you're going to grow your business, you have to hire more people, buy more raw products, maybe rent more space. 

You have to pay out money before it comes in. You have to think that through. How much growth can you afford? How do you that? Because you do the numbers, okay? What's the timing of the outlays?

People don't want to basically come to work for you if you say, I want you to come to work for me. It's going to be a month before we get revenue from your work. So I'd like you to work for me a month free. 

How much growth can you afford? We've already talked about that growth can put you into a different, more competitive space. The game will change. Growth fundamentally changes everything, because when you grow, you will learn, okay? 

## 1.5

Why should we grow? How will we grow? How much should we grow? How much growth can we afford? Do we have enough people? Do we have the right people? Do we have hiring in training processes? Do we have adequate financial controls, adequate quality controls? Will growth create risk for our culture? 

The Growth Risk Assessment Tool is one of the key tools that I will leave you with in this entire course. 

So, you should, you can print out these questions. Why should we grow? That's an important question. Is it money? Is it to help people? Is it ego? 

Why? How will we grow? How will we get more customers? How much, will we grow? Do we want to double in size next month? I don't think so. How much do you want to grow over what period of time? How much growth can we afford? We've already talked about what that means. In order to grow, what do I have to do? What do I have to fix? What do I have to improve? What's it going to cost me? How many more people, okay? 

If I spend that money, how long is it going to take me to get new customers? How long is it going to take me to deliver my products? How long is it going to take me to get paid? What is the time frame between cash going out and cash coming in? Do I have enough money to afford to grow that much or do I have to pace it? 

Do I need more people? Do I have the right ones? Do I have good hiring processes? Most entrepreneurs when they grow their business learn, they are poor at hiring. In fact, one common theme from all my research, hire slowly, hire slowly, fire quickly if you make a mistake. 

Do I have financial controls? Do I know every day, every day, at the close of every day, how much money is in the bank, what my receivables, what my payables are. 

You need to know that every day. To have adequate quality controls, how do I know, as I ramp up, that my customers going to get good quality? What type of inspection controls, what type of check list do I have? What type of customer service follow through do I have? How do I know? 

Then, I have to ask myself a set of questions. Will growth create risk for my culture? Will adding a lot of people dilute my culture?What is your culture? What are the general rules, principles of how you want people to act? What are those unwritten rules to bind people together in the common cause that's meaningful? And if I had more people, how do I transmit, teach, educate that culture? 

We talked about customer service, customer experience, cash flow. If I grow, what about my supply chain? Can I get the raw materials? Can my supplier supply me? Will they work with me financially? Do I have the ability to distribute and deliver? 

Do I have a financial safety net if I'm wrong on my projections? I have never, ever had a projection or worked with a projection that a company ever met. Everyone always overestimates how fast and how much money is going to come in. What is your financial safety net? Okay. Once we say, okay, this could create some problems, what do I do to mitigate or reduce them? 

Do I have daily information? Do I have daily information to monitor them? How do I know if it's happening? Who is going to help me? Who is going to monitor, manage, and correct? 

## 1.7 (Eyebobs Interview)

Julie: Well, I think the first thing that comes to mind is do you want to own the entire grape or do you want to own a slice of the watermelon? If you want to own the entire grape it's not about raising capital. It's not about having investors. It's about focusing on the business and living and dying by your own sword. But I think you have to know what you're looking for when you start a business with regard to funding. 

Well to trust yourself. think one of the interesting that, sitting here trying to give advice, is don't take anybody's advice. Listen to what everybody has to say but be able to take that down and simmer it down yourself and follow your own instincts because if you're chasing somebody else's advice, you're always following this guy's advice and that woman's advice and that person's advice. You start to lose touch with what your true belief system is about your product or your service. 

The best people to listen to really are your customers. Not other people that have done it. But go and listen to your customers. If you think you have a niche product and something to sell, go and find out from people that are buying it. 

Well, I think my employees are really my greatest asset at this point. They know so much more about their, their jobs and our business. I couldn't possibly do it all myself. And they're really the experts at it. 

And you have to like and trust them. I think trust is a, is a big word because 
they're running your business. You're not in that customer service chair. You're not always in that shipping area. You're not always in that design phase by yourself. And you've got to have good people around you. 

And I think probably the hardest thing for me is some of those people that are really good at helping you start is as you get on your feet and you're growing and you get bigger, they're not always the right people to take you to the next level. 

It took me a long time to adjust to those ideas because I'm really loyal to my employees because I feel like I owe them a lot of Eyebob's success. But I, I really I try to surround myself with people that I like and trust. 

I think business is fun. So, I, I, I think it's it's the game of business. And I try to include them. We're trying to move more towards open book management in, in parts of our business so that they aren't just a cog in the wheel. 

And I think there's all sorts of fun in getting to know the business. And then there's, there are the social aspects of it. You know, for the first two years that I, I had Eyebobs open and was working at Eyebobs, I was by myself. And I really didn't enjoy working by myself. I am an extrovert. I need to bounce ideas off of people. 

And it's that kind of inclusion, I think, that makes the workplace more fun. get people to contribute in ways that maybe their jobs specifically doesn't ask for. 

And then, they kind of take it after that, you know, from, you can talk about casadia day and baked potato day.  People bringing in brownies and all those types of things, because that happens around here. 

I, I remember from the case and everything you, you told me when we were doing the case that I remember when you started out, it was, it was so lonely that you went to lunch a couple times a week with the mailman. 

What, what message does that send to your people if you're willing to share numbers with them? Alright, we're just starting to open that up right now. And I'm learning, that's something that I'm learning to do. 

These are the people I like and trust with my business. So, it's taking it to that next level. And you, you talked about the challenge and it's a difficult And that most entrepreneurs face and this is this, as you grow, it's what I call the upgrading problem. 

As you grow, you need better processes, better systems, and sometimes people that can take you to the next level but you've got very loyal people who got you to where, you know, to the level before and it's a, it's a real traumatic time for a lot, I mean for most entrepreneurs. And have you been able to basically, I'll use my friend, Jim Collins' terminology, have you been able to find them another seat on the bus? 

But I mean, how do you, how do you stay, how do you stay on the edge? Well, I think there are several things that feed my soul. One is travel and seeing how other people are running their businesses. Mm-hm. They're doing this, you know, at another company, and how does that idea fit in at Eyebobs, and that's where I get my energy from. Is trying to see what else is happening in the other, in other parts of the world. I don't look at other eyewear companies. I don't care what they're doing. It's how, how is the world moving? How are my customers moving? What are their expectations? What do they need? And that keeps my energy going. 

## 2.1

Because what I want you to think is Susan Feller, this nice woman, this retired guidance councellor, okay, who's built this little business and now is sort of overwhelmed with all her growth choices has come to you, John, Bob, Jane, Sue, all of you and said, I need your help. 

The unknown is scary, alright? Many times when you're building a business, you don't have all the answers. Things are uncertain, okay? And the first thing you do when you do that is, is what do I know? Then, the second question you ask yourself is, what do I really know?

Susan was a guidance counselor, a helper, but she loved cooking. And she loved making desserts. In the end, later in life, she contracted Celiac desease, which made it, made it impossible for her, without getting sick, to eat certain types of grains and flours. 

Why is that flour mixture so important? Because that's what she's got that's truly unique. That's what differentiates, she thinks her cakes and pastries and cookies from other gluten-free products. 

Because she bought all those in the stores and said, this is not as good as stuff I used to make. Her goal was to make the best gluten-free tasty desserts, pastries, cookies, etc. Alright. She made it. 
 
Now, the reason I'm going into to the details about Susan's story, ladies and gentlemen, it is a classic best practices of how one starts a business. You don't quit your day job, in most cases to start a business. You start your business small and you know what's the most important thing to do? 

Is to try and find customers who like what you're selling and then figure out where there's enough of them. She started baking in her home and Susan went out and went to grocery stores, natural foods grocery stores in the beginning. 

It took her almost a year to get approval to get into Whole Foods. Then, she makes the move to basically, why don't I go get a small space and she rented 2,400 square feet and she grew. She grew in order to meet the demand in the grocery store and she opened up a little retail bakery. 

And I was down there one morning about 10:00 and I'll tell you, ladies and gentlemen, everything looked so pretty. And Susan goes through and she picks up the German chocolate cake, the carrot cake, the cookies, okay, the lemon tart sand everything. 

She was what we used to call in the business the chief cook, bottle washer, and everything. She did all the accounts payable. She did all the accounts receivable. She bought all the products. She had part-time workers, okay? She built up to where, in the case, when we got to the end of the case, she had seven part-time bakers, okay, and helpers. She did the delivery. She was the salesperson. She's the one that went to each grocery to get customers. She delivered. She did everything.

You should have just said Julie because Susan believed in paying my bills with cash. Don't borrow money. When my bills come in, pay them very soon. 

It's going to make the point as to how you as a strategy consultant working with Susan have got in to get into the granular details because Susan didn't know what the real cost, per-unit cost were. 

What does that mean? What does per-unit cost mean? She didn't know whether that little lemon cake, which sells for 3.50, she didn't know whether it cost her $1.00 to make, $1.50 to make or $4.00 to make. She didn't know. 

Now, the Whole Foods' situation, basically, got her into the big leagues. And the case told you, she was operating currently at 70% capacity. 

Now, she made a couple of different kinds of products, didn't she? She made frozen cookie doughs, okay? She made, if you will, real-life pastries, cakes, and everything that have shelf lives. Why is this important? 

Susan, the entrepreneur. What are her strengths and weaknesses? What is she good at? What are her personal and business goals? What are her priorities?

Why, when you're making your growth decision for your business, do you need to sit back and do the same. What am I good at? What am I not good at? What do I enjoy doing? What do I not enjoy doing? What's my end-game? End-game, gain, what do I mean by that? 

What do I mean by end-game? Is it your ultimate goal? Do you want to be a large public company? Or do you want to earn so much money to live on? Do you want to have 50 employees? Do you want to be the number one provider of your product in your community in which you live? What's the end-game, why are you doing this? Now, most people want to grow a business because they think they have to. 

All you got to do is outcompete the competition. And you learned you don't have to grow, unless you want to grow. And understanding why you want to grow is critical to this whole analysis as what she should do. It's interesting. 

## 2.2

In many cases, entrepreneurs are trying to do good. But Susan had, in the back of her mind, a couple of primary reasons. Help people to build something that my sons could work together and build and make it into the dominant big gluten-free, all natural, certified bakery, okay? Helping people enjoy foods when they have celiac disease. An honorable, good goal. 

What was her strengths and weaknesses? She was an artist and a guidance counselor. What did she say she loved in the case? She loved baking beautiful desserts, cakes and she loved making them for. Weddings, birthdays. She said to me, when the joys in her life was one of the first birthday cakes she baked for a little boy who was celiac. It puts together her love of art and creativity, her love of giving as a guidance counselor and her love of solving the celiac problem. 

So what was her weaknesses? She didn't know accounting, she didn't know how to create business processes. Right? She didn't even know what her cost per unit was. And she really, didn't want to manage a big business. So she was sort of in a quandry, where her personal goals, were propelling her to get bigger and grow But, as she grew the business, she was playing not to her strengths, but to her weaknesses. And the other thing is, as she grew her business, and she was the lead sales person, okay. She grew her business, The more the business grew, the less time she had for making her beautiful cakes for weddings and birthdays which was her love, her passion. 

Did Susan have strategic focus? What do you think, she has strategic focus?  Should she have focused on frozen cookie doughs, because of long shelf life. Should she just focus on certain types of cakes, certain types of cookies. Or maybe should she just do the big cakes for the weddings, birthdays, that she likes to do every once in a while. And should she just make many individual serve deserts? This is what you'll face as you try to grow a business, lots of decisions. 

Did she have operational excellence? I put a question mark by this. Well, it depends how you define operational excellence, doesn't it? That's why she got, stayed in new crops. That's why she got into whole foods. She can make a good product, but what we don't know is, was she making those product's individually profitably. Because she didn't have processes that measured her per unit cost's. She didn't have real, an accounting system. 

Alright? She just had a file folder with accounts payable, accounts receivable. Okay. She didn't have sales strategy or sales process, she didn't have processes that she could basically used to teach other people. So, she was weak on process. 

So, she was weak on strategic focus, she was weak on operational excellence. Did she, was she customer centric? So she had customer centricity and she had high employee engagement. She had an issue of strategic focus, and she had an issue of operational assets. 

So, we, we talked about her strengths and weaknesses. We just talked about the businesses' strengths and weaknesses.

So what were her alternatives? Keep doing what she's doing. Improve and grow slowly. Number 2, expand into more Whole Foods stores. And expand the product lines in Whole Foods. 3, remember in the case, you had the idea. 

I make more money by selling retail than selling wholesale. But it's easier to sell wholesale. And grow a business, because that person can sell lots of pot. You're leveraging yourself. So she could have a wholesale distributor sell and deliver her products. 

And what we know is, successful entrepreneurs take small steps, not big risk. They do this, they don't do that, why? Because, when you face the unknown and you face uncertainty. You take small steps, and you learn as you go. 

## 2.3

When you're in unknown, uncertain situations don't bet the ranch or, putting another way, don't bet your house. Don't bet your family's well-being. Don't bet all your assets, small bets. Learning, we called it learning lunches here. 

Reject alternatives that are too risky and premature. You assess that by, what's two ways? What's the likelihood of it succeeding, probability of success, probability of success. And how big is the financial risk compared to your, your net worth. 

Premature alternatives. What does that mean? Well if you go back to the conversation we had. And what I'm trying to basically make the point. Are you ready to grow? What does Susan have to do before she can grow? What are the preconditions to growth? 

Well, Susan needs to determine the cost of per-unit production. She didn't know which of her products are profitable. She needs to make sure she's got control processes, quality and financial in place before. She needs some software to help her manage the business. Now these are not big things. And she needs more information from the customers about what they will buy. Focus on this, make small bets. Not this, not this pace growth, and prioritize.

Mike (MBA son) joined the biz. Mike sat back and the first thing he did was figure out what were our per-unit costs. He put in some accounting controls. He put in some inventory controls. He put in some quality controls. He went and talked to whole foods. He went and talked to wholesalers. He started exploring. 

And he decided the first thing we're going to do is expand throughout the Mid-Atlantic states in whole foods. And then he thought about, I can manufacture and expand manufacturing. In the current facility fact I can even add on but how do I expand distribution. So then he basically found out who distributed food, who was the distribution company, who had the trucks, who had the delivery people, who made deliveries to Whole Foods, to Ukrops to people he was selling to. 

And he hired them to deliver his products. So that just means that he and his people, his employees had to focus on production. And customer service. Going to see the buyer. Putting on displays in the stores. Alright? Getting new stores. So he basically outsourced or had someone else do the actual delivery.

He has moved deliberately, iteratively, and incrementally has grown the business; has increased the number of employees, has put in more processes while keeping family control of the business. 

Not doing the joint venture while keeping the family brand, Free Fellers, okay? And a couple of weeks ago I was in Whole Foods and I saw the little lemon tarts, the little chocolate tarts, the little pecan tarts and everything. My wife loves lemon tarts and chocolate tarts so I took home each one of them. 

She saw the brand and she said that's Susan and Mike. I said yes it is, and. As when I tasted them years ago, they were delicious. But there they are right there on that shelf, eye level in whole foods. Prime place. And Mike is working those relationships. So they are continuing to grow within their means while they are putting in place. 

People, processes, and controls; they'd been thinking strategically, disciplined, focused thinking. They used the growth risk toolbox. They had focused on scaling, manufacturing, sales, service; but distribution they outsourced. With their employees they have outsourced HR type processing. They now have software. They are going up the chain, ladies and gentleman. 

Growing a business is much more than just strategy. It's much more than just money. It's like helping Susan achieve her dreams. It's helping Mike. It's helping the customers have beautiful, tasty, wonderful food that doesn't cause their disease to act up. 

It's doing good, helping people achieve their dreams; and if you talk to entrepreneurs as to why they want to grow, what I found in my study is the following point. So many of them said to me. Money is not enough. There has to be more, because at some point, you have enough, but you still want to grow, and there's got to be a reason. 

Four P's. Planning for growth. Processes. Prioritization and pace. 

## 3.1

Planning, prioritization, pace and processes.

You learned that to basically be very good in business, you've gotta take care of customers and have operational excellence, and have high employee engagement. It's not just about money. Money is the result of lots of other things.

Smart growth emphasizes what, ladies and gentleman? That you need to respect
the power of growth, and you need to grow smartly.

You have to, basically, approach growth with planning and thinking about, what do I need to do? How do I control it? How do I make sure my customers are not going to experience disruption?

What you do when you're growing a business, you, as the entrepreneur, have to got to figure out, what mistakes do I focus on, and how do I teach, not punish? Because in order for people not to make the same mistakes again and again and again, they have to do what? They have to learn.

Running a business is a lot like farming. The research show entrepreneurs, and you know this if you're an entrepreneur, you work longer hours in your own business then you worked when you were working for someone else, because, you can't leave it. 

Managing an entreprenuerial business is constantly choosing which fires to fight, and after you put the fire out, leaving a fire extinguisher behind.

We set up as if we were a large company from the start. If you're planning, ultimately, to get big, maybe you have to do some things in the beginning.

Everyday I take out my piece of paper and I write my to do list, top priority, everyday. The first thing I do everyday, is the thing on the list that I dread the most or don't enjoy the most, or that's the hardest for me to do.

Give yourself an afternoon weekly, sometime, to think about the five critical things going on in your business, and make sure you're focused on the big opportunities or the big problems. I call that firehouse time.

Prioritization. I think this is mission-critical. And you learned, that with Susan Feller, the first thing she had to do was to prioritize her goals. Her goals, her values. And then that allows her to prioritize her growth alternatives.

Don't get involved in all the brush fires. Focused on the thing with the biggest impact, the biggest fire that could do the most harm.

_I do not pay you to get everything done everyday. I pay you to get the most important things done._

Here's the focus statement that we've had before, be two inches wide and two miles deep. Two inches wide, two miles deep. In a high-growth business, it's easy to get spread too thin, trying to be too many things to too many people.

Focus on the one thing you can do better than anyone else, and focus on a way to make it appealing to a big market. Lots of customers. Lots of customers. The big market. 

#### Process

Process is, is the how. So, I get 99% defect-free, on time, quality delivery. as the goal, and I reach it many days.

Processes are what you put in place to prevent errors, mistakes, variance. Okay? Variance. Processes is how you reduce mistakes. 

I do not want a single point of failure. What's that mean? That means, and this entreprenuer who said it, he said, every person, okay, must train someone else to do their job. 

The fire extinguisher. No single point of failure. Trust but verify. The more we focused and said no, the more we grew. Focus on doing one thing very, very well that's got a big market.

## 3.2

Interesting story. 1998. Dave starts his own business, uses $30,000 of his personal savings, and he goes through a process, over the last 23 years, of building a business today, which this year will do $400 million of revenue. 

And Dave concluded, as he looks back on it all, that businesses don't grow unless the people grow. And Dave also concluded, a business doesn't grow unless the entrepreneur grows. What do i mean by that? 

Growth takes more people. More people takes processes and controls. It sort of builds upon each other, okay? And when you have more people, then the entrepreur has to delegate.

So I go from entrepreneur, to manager, to leader, and ultimately, you get to where Dave is now, is you get to be coach and mentor.

Dave learned basically, the principle, alright, of wow, I need to have a repeatable system, that Dave called McDonaldized.

Building a business is like a giant jigsaw puzzle. I gotta have the right processes. I gotta have the right employees. I gotta have the right attitude about customers. I gotta care about customers.

That's what all this process is about. Because he's trained his people in the kitchen, and he's trained his waiters and waitresses, what are the critical things to say and do with every customer. So when they leave they feel that way, that's why this process stuff's important. We call it in business school, operations. Because it all comes in to play about how your costumer feels and whether your customer keeps coming back.

- The entrepreneur's job is to create the process.
- The manager's job is to ensure the process is used, and used correctly.
- And the technician, the doer, the employee, the installer in this case, job is to follow the process and use it.

We always remind ourselves, it's not okay to put in place a mom and pop system in place, because that's just going to keep us small forever. A big business is just a small business that got big.

And Dave is saying, put in place the processes that are going to allow you to grow if you choose to grow. Put in good processes, and you're constantly improving processes. And who is the person that will most likely come up with the ideas of how to improve the process and make it better? Your employees.

So make it part of their job descriptions, not only to use the process but to constantly improve the process. Because if you're constantly getting better, faster, and more efficient, you will outrun the bear.

The next thing Dave had to do, was he reached the point where he had to start prioritizing. He had to define his business. Why is this important? Because when you define who you are, that helps you determine what to focus on, and most importantly, what not to do.

Focus is critical in it all. So he had to define himself, so his employees knew, and he defined himself as a home installation product company.

By defining himself as the home installation, he said, I'm not going to do commercial or business installations. I'm going to the residential home owner. And that allowed him, as you read in the case to limit his products, to his limit his spare parts, to limit what his installers had to learn, so that they became very, very good.

Today we still have only 13 part numbers in our inventory room, the same 13 we had ten years ago. We have not added things. Wee kept doing more of the same, better, trying to McDonaldize it. We understood focus as the goal early on, constantly using an A, B, C format to prioritize. 

And at the top of the circle, the circle of life starts with marketing. You gotta do marketing to get sales. Okay? Then once you have sales, you've gotta install. Once you install, you gotta bill and collect. And then you start over.

In Dave's model, everything starts with marketing, and Dave used a bottle-neck priority approach to managing. Where is the bottle-neck? If it's in marketing, Dave is going into marketing, and overseeing it.

What's going on in sales? If I sell a lot, if I get a bottle-neck in installation, you remember in the case, he says they knew where the bottle-neck was by where I showed up everyday.

So everybody understood that everybody is dependent and interdependent on each other. Sales can't sell until they have leads from marketing. Installers can't install until sales are made. Billing and accounts payable and working with the customer, can't happen until it's installed. And unless it's all working, there's no
money coming in. 

And in order to do this, he also built an infrastructure, on the Defender Advantage, what he called, his culture. And you saw, basically, his whole cultural multi-year program of training and education.

And the sad point that Dave talks about in the case is, as you grow, sometimes your people can't take on more responsibility and they have to stay in the same position, okay? That's difficult in a business, especially when those employees are loyal employees who were there from the beginning and helped build your business, but it's one of the things you're going to have to face as you grow a business.

## 3.3

One of the key things in thinking about and planning your business and planning your growth is visualizing what your company will look like and visualizing the infrastructure.

And by that, what I mean by that is how much spac, what type of furniture, what type of supplies, what type of people? Alright? How you're going to do each business function? How you going to produce whatever you do? How you going to display it? How you going to deliver it? How you going to bill? How you going to collect? How you going to process your money? How you going to keep track of your money?


Every little detail, because as you build your business, you'll be building processes which is the infastructure, the wiring, the plumbing of your house, your business. Because, without the right infrastructure, at some point in time, the building will crumble.

If you've got 25 employees I would suggest to you, you've got some managers or team leaders or project leaders, people that are responsible for a group. And usually, as I say, usually organizations are built upon seven to nine people is the most someone can basically manage.

If you build your business big like Dave did, 1500 employees, okay? The direct reports that Dave should have is no more than seven.

Dave, he could manage a sales person, another sales person, he could have one installer, an installer's assistant, and then an admin and an accountant person. That's a simple start-up structure. 

The first one was structure, what I look like? The second one is, what do I need? The third is, what do I do myself versus what do I hire other people to do for me? Most entrepreneurs when they grow business, outsource, hire other people to do it for them.

Payroll processing, accounting, doing the taxes, they outsource HR benefit processing. There's companies that do this. Some people outsource manufacturing. Okay? And we saw, that's what Julie did, but, she figured out how to manage quality control.

In the beginning, Defender Direct outsourced the selling to the telemarketing company. They ended up selling and then the vendor just installed, that ultimately was brought in-house. You can outsource delivery.

Okay? So the questions you got are, whats my structure look like, and what is it? How many people can I manage before I need managers? How do I basically put in place the flexibility, stub my house? And what do I do I do directly versus what I outsource? 

## 3.4

The key question about strategic prioritization is your answer to the 3 W's.

*What am I going to sell?* Okay? And Dave, remember, kept defining that. He's going to sell stuff that he can install in the home, because he's the worlds best installer in the house.

*To whom?* Homeowners was Dave's answer. Julie's answer was people over 40 who are losing, if you will, their ability to read without having reading glasses.

*Why is someone going to buy from me?* Why are they going to buy from me? Is it because of price? Is it because of quality? Is it because they are my brother or sister and they love me? Price, quality or maybe it's the customer
experience. 

Too many entrepreneurs think it's because I've got the best product or it's the greatest product.

Trash cans are full of good products or good software that people didn't want to buy, that they didn't need compellingly enough, because the entire purpose of your product of service is to solve somebody's problem, to make life easier for them, to meet a specific need, to reduce what the marketing people say, a customer pain point.

What fire do you put out first? Critical decision.

How do you prioritize? What can do the most damage to your business, to your brand, to your reputation, to your customers, and again, we're not talking about health, life, safety.

You don't eat if you don't sell. You don't sell if you don't have a customer. You don't have a customer unless you offer a good service or product. Now, that was her circle of life and that's pretty good.

Yeah, it comes out to the quality. service and product for her, because if I don't have that, I don't have the customer. If I don't have the customer, I don't eat. 

Another entrepreneur said it this way. Set up three or four priorities that take precedence over everything else. Ladies and gentlemen, manage cash flow, focus on customers and quality service, accelerate revenue growth, and all the rest, unless something is on fire, can wait.

So that entrepreneur said, I gotta make sure I can keep the doors open and pay my bills and pay my employees, focus every day on cash flow, know where my cash is. If I don't have happy customers and quality service, I don't have money, right? Revenue growth is more happy customer. Unless something's on fire, it can wait. 

Huddles, daily prioritization. Every day in every Ritz-Carlton Hotel in every city in the world, every shift, there is a huddle. And a huddle is when all the team members come together, all the employees, and every day, there's a discussion, a short discussion of a key principle, or value, or cultural point and they have 30 key points.

Many entrepreneurs have a morning huddle and set priorities. Some entrepreneurs have a morning huddle and an afternoon huddle. Here are the priorities for the day and the afternoon huddle is what worked, what didn't work, what got done, we need to do first thing tomorrow.

Many entrepreneurs, as they grow their business, post daily key performance metrics, so everyone knows what their company or business is doing, what their function is doing, if it's different teams, different production teams, what each team's doing.

## 3.5

What is that checklist? It's a process. You should have checklists for key processes, key actions, key to-dos, key ways of doing things in your business that people can check off.

And yes, you start out as the entrepreneur writing them, because you've already done that, but as you grow, you get your employees engaged and it's part of their job description.

## 3.6

Most entrepreneurs did not have good hiring processes, good onboarding processes, good review and firing processes, which means, what I found is, they hire too quickly and fire too slowly.

And every time you lose an employee in your small business, it creates real disruption, because it's hard to have relationships with customers, to have your employees have relationships with customers when your employees have high turnover.

## 3.7

Focus equals growth. And we are very cognizant of that at the vendor and that was the key to our growth. It's all about prioritization.

We've focused on a very limited number of hard numbers in our security business. Customers. And it's always Getting more specific and going deeper than it is going wide. And sometimes when we first get success we think it's an opportunity to go wide.

The second one, we get into strategy with businesses. We always talk about know thyself. A lot of times we get into these strategic planning meetings we get a little bit of success we have a couple good ideas.

Instead of talking about what we could do, what we should do, what we want to do, we need to talk about what are we good at already. What are we really good at and how do we just do a lot more of that and bless more people?

Businesses don't grow, people do and I remind every entrepreneur in the end its going to be about you people growing your people its more important than strategy we do forecast we write strategies, It seems like, as quick as we walk out the room, they quickly become extinct.

The who that we want to choose in our fast growing businesses, are people that want to grow. If you don't want to grow. Why would you work at a company that wants to grow? there's actually a barter that we've made with our employees over the years.

You want to grow, I want to grow. You want to become more marketable, I want to create your skills. I have nothing but your best interest in mind than to grow you. And, I'm going to create that kind of an environment. I know when I do that, you will grow my business.

And we have countless stories in Defender. Personal growth, that when someone grows their job becomes easier, they become better able to lead others.

And that leads to promoting from within, building a culture, this idea of always remember, the business isn't what grows. 

Another snippet I love to share with entrepreneurs is never pay anybody more than $100,000 a year without a personal referral. We don't spend a lot of time on Monster or whatever the current search engines are to hire people. For our big time jobs, those come to us through personal referrals.

We want to promote from within, when we need to go outside. I found that high performance people of big salaries , they don't have to look for jobs.

I learned this after awhile was to really look at bringing on people as an investment instead of an expense. And when you really do the math, we start talking about these $100,000 a year people or, or You know it's not a $100,000 investment to hire that kind of person. It's really a $30,000 investment right?

When you change your mentality, and it becomes an investment game, that's where you really grow. This investment in leaders is an investment.

## 4.1

People learn differently, but most people learn through stories. Each case you've had is a story. That story contains many, many teaching points and the purpose, okay of this whole course is what do we know? We know that every entrepreneur, wherever you live, whatever the business is, whatever your background. Every entrepreneur, you, if you want to grow a business, you will face similar challenges, and the same challenges that Julie face, okay. That Susan faced, okay. That Dave will face, okay. All of the entrepreneurs that we have read about And Parik who is our subject today. So, those stories, those cases. I have read them many many times. Every time I read them something jumps out at me again. They are your real take away. Read those stories as you go through the growth process. 

What does it mean to grow a business? And that's what we're going to focus on today. Today's class with enchanting travels is going to take us into a whole new area that you haven't been. We're going to focus on the big "W." "Why" is someone going to buy from you? And we're going to focus on differentiator.

Now, a differentiator's got to be differentiating in two ways. Two. One, it's got to be different from what the competition is doing. But as or even more importantly, the customer, has got to perceive it, see it as different. Because you can differentiate yourself all you want from the com, from the competition. But if the customer, the buyer, your source of revenue, doesn't see it as different, it's not value or worth anything, 'kay? And that's what we're going to talk about today, because as we're going to talk about in this. Class today, on the enchanting travels is this. How do you scale a business? Scale a business is, how do I get bigger, okay. How do I reach lots more, many more customers? Okay? There's really only, if you think about it, you're starting a business. 

There are 4 ways you can grow your business. And the one I'm focusing on today is scaling. We're going to talk about, at the end of the class, the other 3. How do I bring in more money? Find more customers to sell my pen to. Or, sell more stuff to the customers I got! Or a combination. Now, in order to scale, that means I got to do more volume, more volume. In order to be able to scale I got to be able To produce or manufacturer more, create my product, I've got to be able to reach more customers, how do they know I'm here? I've got to be able to actually sell. I've got to be able to actually sell, I've got to be able to distribute, deliver. I've got to be able to collect, pay, everything has got to be able to get bigger, okay? 

It's hard to scale. Especially when you're a small business trying to grow. Why? How do customers find out about me? How do I get the word out? It costs a lot of money to do marketing. Wow! How do they reach me? If they don't live where I live. How do I manufacture or get enough product ready? How do I hire enough right people who can basically sell, deliver, take care of my customers? How do I make sure when I do that everything's getting done? In the way I want it to be, that's what scaling is about. 

If you have processes underneath, it allows you to scale. And the Enchanting Travels case is a scaling case, all right? It is a scaling case. So, let's start with Enchanting Travels. First question. What is Enchanting Travels' customer value proposition? Going to go back and use the technique we used in week two. I'm asking questions and what I want you to do is to answer them in your mind, or get your paper and pencil, and write down some notes. What is, first of all, a customer value prophecy? What do you think it is? Take a second. Think about that. Well we know what customer is. That's the person that's buying. What's the value proposition? The value proposition is, starts with a need. What do I need or want as a customer? And how will you Mr. or Ms. enterpreneur meeting my need in a way that satisfies me, that I can afford. And I perceive, that for paying you money, okay? Money. I'm going to pay you money. Here's my money!. What a I receiving in return for the money as the customer? Do I perceive that that value what you're giving me meets my need? So I've got to offer a customer value proposition that customers perceive as solving their problem or need that they value. Now what was Enchanting Travels' customer value proposition? Think about that. What was it? I know you're thinking. That's why I'm giving you time. I know you're there, I know you're thinking. And I betcha somebody said, they do travel tours. Hm. Is that right? Do they do travel tours? Let's think through that. What was unique about them? 

Enchanting Travels had a distinct customer value proposition that was aimed at me as a customer. What was it? Enchanting Travels does customized tours. With Enchanting Travels, Ed only dealt with one Cause Enchanting Travels did everything, and basically from the time you arrive to the time you leave, they are in control of delivery. They, all right, are in control of delivery. 

Their value proposition is to deliver a high quality wonderful experience to their guests. So they wanted to control experience, which means delivery. And what's the other reason? Ca-ching, Ca-ching, Ca-ching, because they keep the profit. In each stage. They keep the profit in each stage. So there's two reasons. To control the experience and the delivery and to make all the money in the value chain, very, very shrewd. So, customize tours. Controlled, controlled delivery through the value chain, to deliver a great travel experience. 

And then, the other part is, they knew that their model would work best if they focused on countries. Where it's complex to deliver that. Where it's hard to deliver that, for many reasons. And then, they focused on customers who wanted to come from North America and Europe, to those countries. So they built their first business based on bringing people from North America, the United States and Canada. And people from Europe, primarily the United Kingdom, Germany to India.

The first paragraph, my friend Pareek. In the early days we were trying to build a brand, it was imperative that every single guest, noticed. Enchanting Travels are in the business of providing guests the wonderful experiences and they do that by customizing it, controlling the delivery from soup to nuts and we'll talk about other parts to why they do that in just a second.

## 4.3

Alright. So I know that you thought of, well headquarters needs information. And those hundreds of tours. Where are we behind? Where does there seem to be a blip? Where do we need to put some emphasis? If there's a problem, do you need help fixing it? Alright? They need to have basically taught their people on the ground if this happens, do this. If that happens, do this. How to react.

They go through what we call scenario planning. What would happen? What would happen if someone got very sick? What would you do? Each city. What doctor? What hospital? Where to go? What if the car is in an accident? What would you do? Thinking through all these eventualities that occur. What is our plan? What is our process? How do we deal with the stuff? Because you've already learned Running a business is like living a life. Stuff happens. Okay? Never goes according to plan. There always has to be a backup plan. And remember one of the entrepreneurs, we talked about that said, no single point of failure. 

Same entrepreneur also said trust but verify. Trust your people but check. That's why you have processes. I want to talk about employees. [UNKNOWN] and his partner had a very interesting concept about employees, didn't they? Okay? Great term. I never have seen it before. I've never seen it before. They wanted to hire freshers. A fresher is someone who has not worked in the travel industry specially in India. He want to hire very bright people, who lived mainly outside the country where his customers were, in united states. Or in the United Kingdom or Germany. But, we're either from India, they either were educated in the United States, or they were on visited, they went to work, they knew India, and they knew the country of the customer, but they didn't know the travel industry. 

Then you're saying to yourself, wow, why would you want to hire someone with no experience in the industry? Think about that. What do people with experience come with? They've learned to do it a certain way, somewhere else. But we didn't want that, because he was trying to deliver a different experience. And he was concerned, that if people had experience doing it one way, It would be hard for them to change and learn the enchanting travels way. He made the decision it was easier to teach and train without having those biases or those preconcived notions about the business, so he hired fresher. 

*And it's interesting, he also followed another concept, hire people like your customers.* Hire people who understand your customer. I'll give you the example. When my wife dealt and planned our trip to India, which, by the way was wonderful, great country, loved it. Our tour. Planner, alright, was based in India, but she had lived several years, in fact, in Chevy Chase, Maryland, the United States, a little suburb outside of Washington, DC. Where we had lived once. She was able to understand the customer, and translate the customer's desire, tour desires into, what would work in India? She knew nothing about the travel industry, but she knew who her customers were. 

And so, that was interesting, wasn't it? Freshers. Better to train fresh, rather to retrain and get rid of bad habits, when you're going for world class service. 

Now, he expanded next to Africa, and they did it a little differently there. They did an experiment. because Africa's one, very large and each country in Africa very, very different. So you read the case. What they do? They tried something. They did an experiment. Yeah. You're right. They did a joint venture with a partner, their first partnership, and that partner was responsible for delivery in the countries in Africa, building out the infrastructure, using the Enchanting Travel processes, hiring and training the people, et cetera. Alright? So they had a partnership. Very different. That means that Preak, alright? Preak and his partner owned the Africa business with a local partner. Okay? They shared the profit and they shared the downside. Okay? They shared the financial risk. It took them longer than expected, because of the complexity in Africa to basically get it right. Then, once they got it right, they said, hm. What do we really need in our business model? Well, we have a lot of customers from the United States and Canada. They'd been to India. What's the likelihood they're going to come back to India in 2 or 3 years? Not high, if there's other places they'd like to go to. 

And they said, South America, Argentina, ultimately Chile and Peru. So they decided to start in Argentina. They actually moved to Argentina and lived there for almost six months, visited the cities, the hotels, the resturants and basically created the list of hotels and restaurants, cities, sights, tourist attractions, that would be in the package to be customized for the customer. 

In order to do that he had to put in place structure. We talked about that previously. You read the case and you saw [UNKNOWN] and his partner Alex split responsibilities. They had seven people reporting to them. Remember the number seven, we went through that in the structure. Very important. 

## 4.4

The question, franchise or not? Business is pretty simple folks, the rules. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to be a great business person. You also don't have to be a rocket scientist to be a good business professor, else I wouldn't be here, alright? It is, okay, business. The rules and the concepts are understandable and, quite frankly, pretty simple. It's the execution. It's the execution that's hard. It's the day in day out execution, the doing, the persistence, the discipline, the passion, of striving to learn and be better, and be better, and be better everyday. And to be able to deal with the fact, there's going to be mistakes and fires for you to put out. That's what this course is all about, to increase the probability, of a, of your business when it grows being successful. 

Alright. Franchise. So in checking travels, could franchise, and we'll just say Tibet, China, wherever, what's the advantage of franchising? Hm, Parik doesn't have to move to the country and live for 6 months. Someone else hires the employees. Someone else has the daily headaches and they pay me, the franchisor of Enchanting Travels, a nice fee in the beginning. Caching, caching, money in and every month they pay me a fee, a percent of their revenues. Now, that's all pretty simple, ain't it? What do you think? Should Enchanting Travels, should Parik and Alex franchise? 

Let's go back to their customer value proposition. What is mission critical for their customer value proposition? What is it? Customized tours, kay'? High quality delivery. They're trying to build repeat customers who go to different countries with them. What's mission critical for their success? High quality delivery. How do they ensure that happens? They do that by controlling all parts of the process. *So the risk of them franchising is, they no longer control local delivery, local employees.* They no longer do the hiring, the training, they no longer do, if you will, the oversight of the trips in the country where they franchise. There's a huge risk to franchising. Is, the risk to them is in the customer segment they're dealing with, in the type of tours they're doing. The risk is bad quality, more problems, hurt the brand, lose customers, no repeat business. That is why up until now, they have decided not to franchise.

Improvements. Better, faster, cheaper. What can you improve? Well, you can improve your product. You can make your product more quickly. You can improve customer service. You can improve your sales cycle. Sell faster. You can collect your cash faster. You can make doing business with you easier and smoother. People like to do business with nice people. People like to do business where it's easy. People like to do business with people that smile. 

You can operate more efficiently and that means you can reduce your cost. Reducing your cost does what? Cost go down, profits go up usually. You can get, drive more productivity, do more with the same amount of people from process improvements. Ladies and gentlemen, basically you can improve constantly every process that impacts quality, money and customers in your business. You will never run out of things to improve, ladies and gentlemen. And notice what I've said, quality, financial controls, and customers. Without quality, you don't have money. Without quality and making money and staying in business, you don't have customers. 

I believe in repetition. The science shows you learn through repetition. How do you improve? You try new things in small experiments and you learn, you learn from experience. Learning drives money. And why are improvements necessary? To stay ahead of the competition.

## 4.5

The second way is innovations. Pay close attention please. Doing something that's really new or different for you. I didn't say something that's unique and never been done in the world. With all due respect, that's highly unlikely.

What we know is, is that innovation in business comes from two primary ways or processes. Combine existing things in a new way, put 'em together differently or two, learn something from a different type of business and transfer to your business. This is what Julie said. Remember? Julie says, I'm out visiting companies. I'm visiting companies that are not in my industry to learn and see what they're doing, what's best practices? 

Many, many companies learn from other companies. Learning from other companies is the primary way, for example, that Sam Walton built Wal-Mart. In the early days of Wal-Mart, he would send his management team out into the field every Monday. They would go to stores that they were responsible for, and let's say they came to the Charlottesville store. That manager had the responsibility of going to visit all competitor stores in Charlottesville every week to learn and see what they were doing. And that's where Mr. Sam got a lot of ideas about merchandising, alright? 

He got ideas when he traveled to Korea, to the Netherlands. You can learn from other people, so depending on what kind of busines you're in and let's just make it simple. You're in a retail business, you go shopping all the time. Well, just don't go shop, go learn. Go in and say, wow, what is he or what is she, or what are they doing, that really is captivating me? How are they merchandising? Alright? What do they do with sales merchandise? What kind of lighting? What can I learn? 

You challenge the usual way assumption, asking, why is it done this way? Challenge and ask why. Adults forget to ask why and challenge the basic assumptions. You innovate with customers. Customers will tell you what they want. Talk to customers, listen to them. If a customer says, well, you know, this would be nice. You should say, can I try that with you? Can I do that and you give me feedback? In what we call Learning Launches, do experiments, do tests. You don't have to do big changes, try it, make a small bet, don't change everything at once, test new ideas and learn. Growth is learning. Growth is testing.

## 4.6

Alright. The third way to grow a business. Well, we've been talking about it, in this whole class, scaling. Notice, I call it the turbo charger of high growth. Basically, business grow, business grows something like this and then they take off like this. That's scaling. That's doing lot's more at the same time of what you're already doing. That's getting a whole lot of new customers at one time in a short period of time. 

Now, when you scale, you're not going to keep going up. Eventually, you're going to level off, that's called plateauing. You may level off and dip, but then the question is, that you'll be asking yourself, what is the next way I scale? What's the next growth scaling opportunity? Scaling requires you to think about the planning and the processes, what are you outsource, so you can scale faster and cheaper. 

Alright? Scaling, if you outsource, allows you to focus on critical processes. We have been through this before. This is a little bit. Okay? But we haven't made the following point, what should you rarely outsource? What's so important? Quality controls, financial controls, control of your customer.

Now, new stuff here. New stuff. You basically grow by adding more customers and/or selling more stuff to your existing customers. 

- How, what are the common ways people can grow? 
- What complementary products/services can I sell to existing customers? 
- What new products/services that I can make that my customers need? 
- Can I basically reduce the features of my current product or service? In other words, can I do less and offer a cheaper version to a different customer segment? 
- We call that, can I go down market? I'm still going to offer high quality, I'm just not going to do as much. 
- What can I do to increase the frequency of purchases? 
- Can I have loyalty programs? 
- Can I add a new distribution channel to reach new customers? 
- The Internet, okay, as an example, can I bundle services to products? Can I bundle things which will get me new customers? Can I add pricing, financing, or guarantees that will produce more buyers? 
 
## 4.7

Most growing businesses don't do this until they get very big. Alright, but in order to be complete, strategic acquisitions, buying another business. Strategic acquisitions for small, growing businesses are high-risk because it requires fundamentally different expertise than scaling this and this. You gotta learn how to investigate and do due diligence. You gotta learn how to value what you're buying, so you don't pay too much, and that you get what you're buying. And you have to be able to basically bring the business in and integrate it into your culture and your processes and your way of doing business.

## 4.8

It's a workshop, real life case and you've got the case. C.W. Barger & Sons. Here is the issue. This is a business that is selling a commodity product. *The commodity product is a product that has no differentiation except cost, price. When you sell a commodity product, usually, the lowest price wins.* Usually, the person with the lowest price is the biggest company. You don't want to sell commodity products. Commoditization is the cancer of business. 

This business, okay, is selling commodity products and that's why its business is plateaued and decreasing. And the father has told the son, Eric, you either need to fix this business or we're going to shut it down. Well, I want you to think about the four ways to grow and I want you then as you're thinking about improvements and innovation and scaling to think about all the different things this business does. How would you improve manufacturing? How would you improve sales? How would you improve delivery? How would you improve inventory and raw material control? How would you improve the customer experience? How would you improve your employee engagement? What would you do advertising and marketing? 

And then, go use the growth boosters, say which could apply to this business and come up with a list of ways to improve and grow this business. Now, I can tell you, okay, that there are, because of what Eric Barger did, he actually quadrupled the size of this business in 3 years. He did about 26 different things, so when you're thinking and writing your list, if you come up with four things, there's a lot more you could be thinking about. If you come up with ten, there's lots more you could be thinking about.

## 4.9

Here's the three most important things I've learned from having done that. what I would have done differently, if, if I had to do this over. so on a general level, you know, you can't rate the importance of people highly enough, and I'd say that the number one thing that I'd, sort of, advise future entrepreneurs to focus on is, to invest in the right people, who can grow with the company. 

Now, you know, that's, it, it sounds like an obvious thing, and you read, you read about the importance of people in any organization, but I think what I've learned is when you're a start-up, when you're a young venture, you tend to, you know, look for people who can help you start the company and get it off the ground. And I think what is, is really important is, is to, to really have people from the beginning, who you can see grow with the company, and to up-skill them along with the journey of the company. 

And I think that's one of the challenges that we've seen in the last couple of years, is, you know, part of our founding team has been with us you know, a great cultural fit, with us through from the beginning. But keeping them continuously up-skilled to grow with the changing nature of the business. 

The new challenges that any size brings is, is actually crucial. So, if I had to, you know, if I looked back and I said, six, eight years I'd say, identifying people with potential to be up-skilled and grow along with the company and that can really deal with the challenges that scale brings in, and so on. So I'd say that's the number one piece of advice I'd give. 

The second thing I'd say, is, you know, really, not losing your, focus, and, on, on what is your core business? keeping your eye on the ball, not losing sight of, really, what makes you successful. And, you know, as you grow, it's easy to get distracted. You know, I've, I've questioned myself on some of the initiatives that we've run in the last couple of years, and, and have realized that I think, you know, just staying focused on what makes you good and unique I think is a great, is a great thing to have. 

And I'd say, if I had to pick one more, sort of, general piece of advice, that I'd give is to, you know, change is a part of any growing business. And, and I think how, how you manage change is actually crucial to how successful you will be. And I believe in, in managing the changes along with the growth of the company to really focus on, on small, steady and incremental changes that will have a good impact, rather than, you know, this big bang approach, and, and sort of sweeping changes every time you hit landmark. 

Every time you hit a milestone, because, again, it's easy, if you grow from, you know, 10 to 15 million, and you have a, a host of new challenges, it's easy to say, you know, now, let's just change all our processes. 

So I think, looking back, I, I've seen that that's one of the challenges that we've faced, and I'm, I'm more and more a believer and, and would strongly advise, you know, having, having a very clear idea on, on what you want to do and, and, and driving small changes incrementally that will have a, a good impact in the short to medium term and not making sweeping changes every time you reach sort of, a milestone, or new level. 

I'd say, looking back, over the last couple of years, the number one sort of initiative that we have driven, and, and sort of have, have really been focusing on is, to realign our strategic intent of the company. We wrote a business plan eight years ago, when we were at business school. The company that we operate now is completely different from that business plan, as most companies are. We had a, we would have been bankrupt in, I would say, six years ago, had we followed our business plan. 

I think what we've really done in the last couple of years is you know we had this business plan, and then what we, since we deviated quite a bit from it, we we've moved into, sort of, executing an annual strategy or more, sort of, an annual plan and, sort of, we came up with tactics as to, what do we want to accomplish this year? What are our objectives? and, and then we sort of came up with an annual plan. Now, I think moving from, you know, year to year with an annual plan and, and, and, sort of, trying to meet yearly objectives, it's easy to again lose sight of the big picture, and, and really stay focused on where you want to be in five years. 

Be very clear and transparent, not just with yourself, but with all stakeholders, what is the strategic vision of the company? What are the core values of the company? and, and really, what is the, the intent of the company? Where do we want to be in five years? And you know, that's very, it, you know, it's almost like going back to a business plan, but with a lot of knowledge about what makes you successful. 

We had a lot of challenges with, with the team you know, our, given that we operate in so many countries. We have 18 nationalities. It's easy to, sort of, get diluted and, and, sort of, lose track, and, and have people going in different directions. Speaker: Right. Speaker: And what we, what we just did was, we brought it all together, and said, okay, guys, we speak seven different languages from 18 nationalities, and we're operating in, in four continents. It doesnt matter where you are. This is the intent. This is the strategic vision of the company. This is our intention, and this is our, so these are our values.

And what we were very clear on is to not have a mission statement which sounds good, but you can't really do anything about, or, or is an empty shell but really have a very tangible and achievable vision of the company as well as you know, what are the, the key pillars of our success. That we can actually accomplish. so I think that's been, sort of, the one major change or initiative that has happened since the case, and that's sort of brought a lot more direction into the company. 

And I'd say, the second the second biggest thing, maybe it was even mentioned in the case is, is going back to this up-skilling thing point I mentioned earlier, is, we've really got our core management team together and, and, and really empowered them to take part in the journey on a much more ownership level, than, than it has been in the past. So you know, everyone worked in, sort of, silos, managing their functions very effectively, but we, and,and now, the, the level we're at has posed completely different challenges. 

People need to interact with other managers, from different offices, across different time zones. They're working on projects together, and all of a soon all of a sudden, their skills have been completely challenged. to, to manage this, the, you know, to manage scale on a global level poses completely different challenges. And we've really started investing in training and up-skilling them. rather than just, sort of, giving them tasks and giving them projects and responsibilities to manage, we also give them skills to do that, because other, otherwise we realize we are setting people up to fail. 

You know, you, you, you, you realize, at one point, you know, it's easy to answer, the question of whether someone is a fit or not. But then you sort of drag on, and, and you know, the worst thing is to carry baggage, and, and have people who, you know, might have been good when they, when you hired them, but then the changes of the company. And, sort of, the situation is completely different now, so I think we've also let go of people, that in the past, we would have, sort of, just kept in the system and really focused on, you know, who do we believe is in, in it, for the long term? Who do we believe is really on the bus? and, and who do we believe is just, the right fit for the company? And, sort of, let go of people who we felt that maybe in the past they were, but now they're not. 

## Week 5 Lesson 1 (21.30)

Growth had stalled. What do we mean? Growth had plateaued and in fact, it was going down. And Eric's father didn't like that and said, son, you got to either turn this business around or we going to shut it down, okay?

*The product had become a commodity. A commodity is a product or service that basically, sells based on price. That means the product is not different. Eric's competition saying, sells the same thing he sells.* So, what's the difference to the customer? The difference to the customer is price. If Eric is selling this, and I'm making up this number now, okay, at $1000, and the customer, I mean, his competition, is selling the same exact product at $800 or $900, who you going to buy from? Now, I'm assuming you're not married to Eric's sister, or you're not a relative, or there's not some other reason. I'm assuming you are an arm's length consumer, with no friendship, relationship, okay? You going to buy one of these. 

That was Eric's problem. That was the problem I delivered to you, alright? You also learned there was *low brand recognition in the community* and as I said before, alright, Eric Turn this around or we're shutting down. Now, what did he do that you found interesting? N

- Software for JIT inventory and software for managing the timing of the processes from the order to the delivery and everything could be scheduled to maximize efficiencies and productivity. Software to automate production and supply schedules. He licensed this software eventually.
- Creating standrds and complying with those standards to create a competitive advantage for himeself.
- On-time delivery for the home/commercial builders who put his products on the ground, or free.
- First mover because of incorporating new national standards. He put his company through rigorous certification processes and borught in experts.
- Delivery people became cx service people. Their work had more meaning.
- He strategicallyadvertised on interstate highway billboards, radio sports programs.
- He participated in industry trade associations. He also wrote articles fro industry trade associations. He built a reputation as the expert in his part of the world in this product line. He also talked about community outreach publications.
- He answerd questions for home owners.
- He added 12 more states geography.
- No acquisitions because he didn't want to buy other companies' problems.

## Week 5 Lesson 2 (11.34)

When you solve one set of problems, there's always another set of problems. Businesses don't grow, people grow. Upgrading is the people and processing and controls that work at one level or size of your business will probably not work as you grow much bigger, and you have to improve, upgrade your processes, your controls, and in many cases, unfortunately, your people. 

Yes, let up on that gas pedal. Let up on that gross so your people, processes, and controls can catch up. Yeah, yes, customer centricity. Love your customer more than you love your product, right? Yeah, because your purpose is to meet those customer needs or problems. You stay in business by solving customer problems and offering them things they need or want, customer centricity. But as you grow the business, you've learned what? The reality is, you need more people and so then your business is only going to be as good as how your people do your business. React, communicate, engage with customers, and we've talked about the power of high employee engagement. 

We've talked about strategic focus, right? 2 inches wide and 2 miles deep, right? We've talked about operational excellence. You should walk away with this course, because remember, I wanted to, basically challenge you to change the way you think about growth, they myths of growth, the fact that growth, growth is change. Change is hard. People can only change so much, so fast. 

The problem in the, in, with growth is, is that if you basically let growth overwhelm you, it can outstrip your managerial capacity or your processes or controls. So you should walk away from this course forever remembering the picture of the sunshine. Growth is like mother nature. She can be good, but then the picture of the tsunami or the hurricane, tornado, that growth sometimes if it's too much, too fast can basically overwhelm your business and destroy value. Respect growth. Respect it and use the gas pedal approach. 

We talked about learning. Learning is how you constantly improve. And one thing we know is the bear story. Yeah? In order for you to stay ahead of the competition, you've got to learn, you've got to constantly improve better, faster, cheaper. Sometimes you have to innovate and do something new for you and the purpose of all of this is to be able to scale, do more of what you're already doing and you learn that they're basically two broad ways to grow. Sell your product or service to more customers or sell more stuff to your existing customers, and remember the growth boosters tool?

## Week 5 Lesson 3 (6.42)

*Entrepreneurs approach life proactively, they go for it, they try things, they try to control their own destiny. They don't just sit back and react and let life happen to them.* 

Well, that's a pretty good lesson for anybody, no matter what you choose to do in your life. Be proactive. Make things happen. Seek learning, not safety. 

We know that entrepreneurs are comfortable with entering the land of the unknown and the land of uncertainty because they're confident they'll learn as they go. Entrepreneurs build business, learning as they go, taking small steps. Well, that's a pretty good rule for whatever you do. Seek learning, not safety. 

What do entrepreneurs like Eric do? Eric focused first on what was his strengths? Engineering. So he got into the details of engineering his product. Play to your strengths. Focus on your strengths. You can always improve your weaknesses, but focus on your strengths. Focus on going forward with what the talents you have. 

Small steps. Entrepreneurs try things, they take small steps, small bets, remember the chips, learning launches. Take small steps, because small steps in learning build up and eventually you've gone a long way. Every day, learn something. *Ask yourself every night when you come home, what did I learn today? Try every day to learn at least one thing, that means you're constantly trying to improve your game whatever field you're playing in.* 

It's interesting. A former colleague of mine, named Professor Anders Ericsson is the world's leading expert on expertise. He does great work. He has studied athletes, musicians, chess players. You know, in his work is the foundation for all of the books out there today talking about how to be an expert. Allright? But Anders did the research and he found that experts are disciplined and actually practice, have discipline practice and over a period of time, they have worked 10,000 hours to become an expert of real focus intense practice. And the difference between an expert and somebody very good, was 5,000 hours. So think about that, alright? *Discipline, focus, practice, and becoming an expert in good, is a long term journey, stay on the journey.* Two tools we've talked about and I've tried to get you to engage in, since we're not in the same room, mental rehearsal. Playing in your mind. What if I did this? What would be the result? How will I react if she does this? How will I react if he does that? If someone says this, how will I respond, which prepares you for the uncertainties in the business world if you put some thought, planning. 

Remember the 4 P's, planning, but then, after you, every day, go back and replay in your mind just like a film. Replay. What did I do today? What could I have done better? 

And as you build your business, don't forget most important single word in the business world is please. The most important two words is thank you. The most important three words is I am sorry or I am wrong. And the most important four words is may I help you? 

Look at that growth risk assessment tool. What does that thing teach you? It teaches you look at my alternatives and weigh the pros and cons of each alternative, that's risk reward decision-making and that's a good tool to use in making your life decisions. And don't forget, smile a lot and be a positive force. Do not be a force of darkness.
