3.1: People and Plunderers
•	This course is about the interaction of the different parts of the world. But how about the time before nation-states?
•	Humans initially believed that a God created the world, and there was divine models.
•	Most people lived in the countryside.
 
•	Living standards remained very constant for many centuries after the 1300s. They were remarkably equal throughout the world. Most people lived in the countryside, and most people lived in the same conditions.
•	Most people lived for 30-35 years, and the average height was between 5’0-5’6”, and this was remarkably distributed throughout the world.
•	The exception to the rule was the small number of elites at the top.
•	Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations: Wealth matters for global history because it is the product of human effort above and beyond what is necessary to survive.
•	This matters because we bring the world together because of the idea of wanting to create wealth.
 
3.2: The Wealth of Villages
•	The people at the village lived at a subsistence level. The standards of living remained very close to what was required to survive.
•	It is at the top that urban populations could live off the product of the land.
•	Trade goods, goods which were not need for subsistence, was what made the world economy work.
•	When some villages produced non-Agrarian goods, that’s when we got cloth in Europe, weapons in South Asia, and silk in China. But what was important: spices! Saffron in Spain, pepper in India.
•	These goods were able to be sold across long distances, largely because they were light. Spices were light (not bulky, and were easily tradable).
China
•	The rise of China in our age could be said to be a return to the earlier ages where China was the center of the world economy.
•	With the rise of hydraulic engineering, the Chinese were able to build rice terraces, and eventually build the Grand Canal, which connected Beijing (administrative) with south China’s rice.
•	Because of this, China was able to grow to 100M people. This was also one of the first cases of environmental degradation ever.
•	This is important because when you create wealth, you are able to create political power. When states have resources that can be harnessed, they can become empires.
•	Trade drew parts of China and eventually the world together.
 
3.3: Silk Roads
•	The “Silk Road” was not just one road, and there were other things that were transported along these roads, mostly preciosities (gems, drugs, silk). These roads were causeways for caravans to move goods for consumption and production.
•	Deforestation was needed to make way for mulberry groves which the silk worms needed. This sucked for the elephants. The thing that we know about the Silk Road comes from a cave complex in China (Dunhuang Cave). Dunhuang was a stop in the Silk Road.
•	Buddhism’s path of deliverance can easily accommodate local belief systems. It was easy to spread across the SR. And so, it spread. It also made the commercial transactions easier, through this common faith. This made the Buddha’s message more appealing.
•	Caravanseries (traders) were very important! Some of these became cities, such as Samarkand.
•	There as a land-based trade going on, and these stretched on for thousands of kilometers.
3.4: Sea Lanes
•	Eventually, overland trade was challenged when people took to the seas.
•	Vessels such as the Caravel allowed people to carry more goods, and more varied goods. You can start carrying goods which were not necessarily preciosities, such as wood, ivory, cattle, etc.
•	Changes in navigational techniques: charts, compasses, these were invented in China.
•	Changes in social practices: Arab businessmen opened merchant houses to connect the sea lanes. Family members operated these merchant houses. These were essentially the first agents for commercial globalization. Arabic was the language of business.
•	We get the emergence of the first ports: Molucca, Calcutta, Aden, Venice, these were the first ports.
3.5: Worlds of Genghis Khan
•	Not everyone was sedentary. The Mongols couldn’t rely on basic resources and they were able to survive their environment via predation. The interactions and the visions they had intensified in the 13th century because of the Silk Road and the increased interactions between people.
•	Genghis Khan is an example of how people from the backlands can have a huge effect on World history. He did in 25 years what Rome took 400 years. They were able to fan out the Mongol Empire, only except for South Asia, Afghanistan, and Japan.
•	They were able to defeat the Caliphates and the Sung dynasty, while only being about a million people. We could say that this was the first World War.
•	The Mongols organized effective fighting machines to plunder their neighbors: equestrian culture. These were huge, think up to 125K horsemen, with Chinese doctors.
•	Mongols also relied on terror, with skulls hanging off their horses’ saddles, and surprise, they did specialized fear policies. They got men from the aristocratic classes, and did public desecrations.
•	Because of these desecrations, they received the same treatment whenever they lost.
•	In order to travel, they had to travel light. They had to live off the people they conquered themselves. Sometimes, they just became the same people they oppressed. They didn’t want to kill everyone, they just wanted the locals to provide stuff to them.
•	The Mongols were able to rule this huge empire with the use of proxies. They had to marry into other families. So don’t think that the Mongols killed everyone, they often integrated with the local societies.
•	The Mongols also transported people and culture from place to place. They brought German miners to China and Chinese doctors to Germany. They brought trading cards, carpets, and other products everywhere.
 
4.1: The Black Death
•	In a way you could think that the initial globalization of the world was because of the hooves of the Mongol armies.
•	The Black Death was a portmanteau term, there were many diseases that spread across Afro-Eurasia. The same roads that were used for trade were used by the disease to spread.
•	China, from 120M to 80M. Europe lost 60% of its population. Most affected were the trading posts.
•	The BD wiped out entire markets and it coincided with the weakening of the Mongol Empire. What ensued was a round of chaos and conflict.
•	This was an occasion of renewal, and it allowed for a new phase in world history.
Other Regions
•	They were not part of the broader culture (they were a world apart).
•	Large parts of Africa (West and South) were in large part not affected.
•	East Africa (Somalia and the Swahili coast) was able to trade stuff. It was a source of gold and it introduced liquidity into the system.
•	Central figure: the mosque.
•	So the Arabs had to adapt to the African practice of slavery. They saw that the Africans had slaves. The connectedness between East Africa and Afro-Eurasia led to slave trade up to China.
4.2: Reconstruction after the Black Death
•	Within a century though, trade was coming back, but the political effects were huge.
•	There was a creation of a power vacuum. There were new political systems who had war with each other, especially in the Mediterranean system.
•	Of the new empires, the Ottoman was the biggest. Because it was in the way, the Christians had to look for another way into Asia via the Atlantic.
•	In the reconstruction of Afro-Eurasia, we see newcomers emerge with the need to create a new political order.
•	To stabilize the system, they had to
•	Rely on keeping the rule within family members.
•	They also relied on warfare as an important ingredient in the creation of political power.
•	They appealed to people’s religious ethnic and religious identity. For the Ming, it was the Han identity. For the Christians, it was the connection with God. In Islam, the states that would emerge would rely on a new faith-based model with their subjects.
4.3: The Ming Dynasty
•	In China, vacuums seldom last very long. The Ming took Beijing by 1368. In order to legitimate himself, he would rebuild the army, taxation, create a country examination for professionals, and rebuild the Forbidden City.
•	The random guy took a report from Africa went back to China describing the riches of Africa. He said something about reporting and conquest. By 1300, there was a trade between China and Africa, mediated by the Arabs.
•	While the Mongols wanted to subdue, the Chinese just wanted fealty and tribute.
•	In 1382, the army of the Ming captured a Muslim peasant boy named Ma. Ma (now named Zheng He) would become the commander of China’s great fleets, and he took 7 voyages across the world.
•	Zheng He’s treasure ships would be up to 400 feet long. (The Santa Maria was 90 feet long). The fleets had 300 fleets per voyage.
•	They were able to bring a ton of things, such as giraffes, to China.
•	When Zheng He enters a harbor, we would exchange with an elaborate amount of gifts with the current leaders. Some of the negotiations took months. The Chinese did not strong-arm, they negotiated.
•	When the emperor died in 1424, there was a power struggle. The academics wanted to be more protectionist, and by 1500, an edict went out that ships with 2 masts would be considered a capital offense.
 
4.4: Christianity and Islam
•	In Europe, contrast to China, it’s hardly a story of integration.
•	With persistent feudalism, the struggle would be a hallmark until the end of the Second World War. There was a ton of small and medium-sized states. The effect would be a rise of a highly militarized culture.
•	Conversion follows commerce, and so the corridors of trade would serve as conversion, and in some cases, conquest corridors. So Islam would join Christians, Jews, pagans, to create a heartland of Asia, and the dominant buildings in China would become mosques.
•	There was a western sprawl of Islam too, it gave an internal unity to the regions, culminating in the kingdom of Mali connecting the Niger river with inland Timbuktu.
Expansionary Policies
•	Mughal emperor: Reintegration in India after the destruction in the 14th century, after the Turks (Timur/Tamerlane) invaded them. Tamerlane thought himself as the restorer (Genghis Khan-ish). To defeat the kingdom of Delhi, what he did was to put straw on the backs of camels and set these on fire, which made the war elephants retreat and turn on their own troops.
•	There was a new order in the region, and Tamerlane’s great-great grandson would found the Mughal empire.
•	Safavid Empire
•	Ottoman Empire: The longest regime post-Black Death. This was the child of the Turkish conquerors such as Tamerlane. The rise of the Ottoman coincided with the fall of the Byzantine empire. Constantinople fell in 1453.
•	While Constantinople was open to trade, it was protected by fortifications. When one of the gates was found unlocked, the Ottoman empire flooded and took prisoners.
•	The Byzantine refugees fled to Italy, where they became the ancestors of the people who founded the Renaissance.
•	This was a big blow to Christendom, as their cathedrals were converted to Mosques.
•	By 1529, Muslim armies were camped outside of Vienna. The 1520s were an important decade, as the Spanish were also camped outside Mexico at that time.
•	The Vienna siege failed, because of the weather and torrential rains. Still, the rise of Ottoman power changed the global geography.
•	In the Renaissance, there was a fascination with the East and in fact they consulted with the East often for advice. The Muslims also served as a blockade, blocking the Europeans from Asia.
 
Reddit History
•	China is a very rich zone for growing any kind of crops, there are 4 major rivers in China (Yellow, Yangtze, Pearl, Amur). Same with India.
•	India is incredibly vast and warm, and so the country can grow everything they eat. In ancient times, the Indians were some of the most robust, tall, and healthy people in the planet.
•	SE Asia: The northern part was influenced by China and Europe. Although a diverse array of merchants sailed in the South Cgina Sea, conversion was initially based on the leaders in the city of port.
•	Ninjas did three things: extreme physical conditioning, mental conditioning, and training with specialty weapons and tools. All ninja were also samurai. So a ninja would need to have high upper and lower body strength, especially focusing on the core. They also need to be intelligent and understand how to gauge military strength and power.
•	These were the best of the best, they just had additional training. 
•	They would wear monk outfits or disguise as beggars while traveling to avoid detection. They would sometimes pretend to be traveling performers and magicians.
•	Think of ninjas and samurai as special forces in the military. The main reason to hire a ninjas was information collection, though. Since the Ninja school was rooted in the Art of War, winning the battle without fighting was said to be the greatest achievement, and ninjas who did assassinate and fight were said to be the lowest ninja.
•	A ninja was feared not of what they might do to you but because of how much they could learn abut you.
•	Bushido is not the same as Western standards; samurai had no problems with using trickery, ploys, and other ‘dirty’ methods to win battles.
•	Ninja for the most part did not partake in direct conflict with enemies. If they were going to cross borders, they did not bring weapons.
•	The Japanese did not use shields because they were first and foremost horse archers. You cannot use a shield while either riding or shooting. The rest of the armed forces were made of conscripts using spears.
 
5.1: Worlds Apart
•	Martin Behaim: First globe, was full of errors, and the Americas were missing. Because of a lack of domesticate animals, the Americas did not develop the large scale fighting systems of Europe.
•	Because of the low population density, they didn’t fight, they captured people. The humans that occupied the land were often more valuable than the land was. There was also a different disease pool, so Americans don’t have resistances to Afro-Asian sicknesses.
•	By the late 1960s, it is estimated that the native Americans were around 200M. Largest city: Cahokia (60K people), Cusco (50-60K).
•	The biggest empire: the Incans in the Andes. Biggest population: Aztecs in Mexico.
5.2: New Worlds
•	Incans did not have human sacrifice, but asked for labors.
•	Aztecs: ongoing warfare with the nearby people. Captured warriors were turned into human sacrifices.
•	1497: Estimated 20K-80K sacrificed in a single feast. It was the constant search for captives that led the Aztecs to search for more people to conquer.
•	Internal tensions: Deep feuding among successors, in fact when the Spanish arrived there was a Civil War among the Incans.
•	Aztecs: divided too, but there was a priest and warrior class to keep things more stable.
5.3: Old Worlds
•	Tension in Europe: Russians and Ottomans in the East. West: Portugal and Spain were pushing South, and there were two empires: Castille and Aragon.
•	Alternative routes to the East because of the Muslim blockade: Going around the tip of Africa.
 
Discoveries
•	There were islands in the middle of the Atlantic: the Canaries and the Azores. These were the very first colonies: first sugar plantations, first form of African slavery.
•	Africa as sources of gold and slaves: these lured Europeans further down Africa.
•	Discovery that there were important equatorial currents: Europeans disovered that they can go East through the West. The discovery of the trade winds allowed the Europeans to set sail from NW Africa.
Columbus
•	Everyone had the idea of going West to go East, not just Columbus, but Columbus always thought that the route east was shorter than it was.
•	He made constant mistakes because of his preference of old methods over technology.
•	Pedro Alvarez Cabral: reached Brazil.
•	Columbus offered Castille and Aragon gold from the new world.
•	Even when Columbus reached America, he just assumes that he is in Asia already, and upon landing in the new world, he looks for China and Japan.
•	The first thing to do was to establish communications. Even though Columbus took a translator along, the translator would have no idea of the language spoken by the native Americans.
•	First colonies: Hispaniola in the Atlantic. This was the start of the production of tropical commodities for export to Europe.
 
5.4: Europe Meets America
•	The Legend of El Dorado: Europeans were beginning to speculate that there were more riches inland.
•	Hernan Cortes: Led 500 men and 16 horses from Hispaniola to Veracruz, Mexico. Cortes forged alliances with the Aztecs’ rivals.
•	The fall of Tenochtitlan was even more important than the fall of Constantinople. 
Conquest is a Process
•	Famous defeats: Noche Trieste, 67 other Spaniards were taken, 10 were beheaded. The hearts of the 57 were taken out and offered to the gods.
•	100,000 (600 Spanish) eventually took down the Aztecs, but it wasn’t the war, but  disease, which killed the majority of the Aztecs.
•	When the Spanish entered Tenochtitlan (which was larger than any city in Europe), 40% of the population was already dead. Within 1 year, the conquistadors spoke of having to step over cadavers in the streets. Same case with Incas.
•	Because there were so few Spaniards, the need was to keep the old structure in place. Decapitate the politics, don’t destroy them.
•	Now, you amalgamate indigenous structures to Spanish leadership.
•	For those much less urbanized American cultures, Europeans looked for stuff other than gold: furs, etc (much like Russia’s eastward penetration through Siberia).
5.5: The Columbian Exchange
•	Transactions between the Europeans and indigenous peoples were very important: while it was tempting to just get the gold, the sustainability of colonies depended on whether the Europeans can create a more enduring system of rule.
•	Alfred Combry: The Columbian Exchange. This was not fair to the Americas as they got the microbes (lol). In the first 100 years, the native population declined from 100M-120M to about 20M. There were 14 separate epidemics that spread in the new world.
•	Indians felt that there was an abandonment of the gods or violence by the Europeans and lashed out in response.
•	Contribution 2: Crops. Cotton, bananas, and most importantly: sugar. Sugar, not for local consumption, but for Europe.
•	Contribution 3: Domesticated animals, in fact pigs in the Caribbean became feral because of the lack of predators. “Barbeque” means “head to tail”, because European pirates ate pigs from head to tail to get away from the law.
American Contributions
•	Europeans also got diseases from the Americas, namely Syphilis. Most European armies were inflicted with syphilis especially because of soldiers and brothels. This spread as far to India and China.
•	Flora: Maize, cocoa, potato (more calories/hectare than other European staples).
•	Precious metals: Gold and silver.
•	Ecological windfall: The Europeans found in the Americas food and access to precious metals that would transform the balance of world power from Eurasia to the West.
6.1: Atlantic Ocean Worlds
•	What did the world look like after Columbus? Waldseemuller Map (1507) already included the new world.
 
 
Chinese Interpretation
 
•	China was the center, surrounded by various degrees of other cultures.
Japanese Interpretation
 
•	A lot of textual description in East Asian maps. They describe the contents of the world.
 
Wood
•	In the wake of 1492, there was a boon in shipbuilding because of Brazilwood (Braza meant ember) (orange and red trees for building ships).
•	This began the systematic deforestation of the forests of Brazil.
•	It’s one thing to conquer, but it’s another thing to turn islands into possessions. Whereas before, Europe imported more stuff than it exported (from the East), the conquest of the new world gave Europeans the means to change their balance with the East (it now had a surplus).
6.2: From Conquest to Colonialism
•	Soon, the conquests had diminishing returns.
•	Back in Spain, there was a debate about the ethics, morality, and the legality about the rights of the Europeans to treat the Indians unfairly.
•	Spanish friar Bartolome de las Casas: There was a great deal of exploitation on Hispaniola and Mexico. His treatise, “The Brief History of the Destruction of the Indies”, would go down as the most famous book ever written in the new world.
•	The debate hinged on whether Europeans could enslave Indians. The crown wanted to legalize the colonies but ban slavery.
•	Bartolome argued that the Indians were savages, but were innocents because they had not yet heard of the gospels, and that the conquest would help in spreading the gospel.
Experiments
•	The 16th-18th centuries were experiments in the modern colonies (the Romans had colonies before).
•	The Europeans discovered that there were existing institutions already in these indigenous lands. Because they were the minorities, they had to keep these institutions intact.
•	Leaders of local indigenous villages would be important elements of this new colonial enterprise. Europeans would graft judges and viceroys onto this existing infrastructure.
•	There was a great deal of violence as Europeans and Indians worked out the terms of the compromise on what institutions would govern these colonies.
•	Tupac Amaru (the last descendant of the Incan nobility) was the last one to be decapitated.
•	Courerur de Bois: the French needed an alliance to make sure that the fur trade would still work. The method of negotiation here was to amalgamate themselves into the existing society (they wore Indian garb).
•	To rebalance their relationship with Asia, Europe needed stability. Europeans discovered that they need to reproduce colonies as a source of wealth. So there is a transition from conquest to colonization.
6.3: Silver and Slaves
•	They wanted to extract wealth that had two fundamental bases in the beginning: silver and slaves. 
•	Silver Spanish doubloon: the first world currency, extracted from the New World. 85% of the world’s silver and 70% of the world’s gold came from the Americas.
 
•	This was the oil for the modern world, and it transformed villages into globalization. At its height, the Americas had 30 silver mines, of which the biggest one was the Potosi. The Europeans needed workers to break shit down, and they relied on the village system to get things done.
•	Part of the process of colonization is the peopling of the Americas, and the vast majorities of the people who moved to the Americas were not Europeans, but Africans (6.5 million people).
•	They were bought in ships such as the Tumbeiro.
 
•	By the time the slave trade ended, 10-12 million Africans were shipped. This would only be eclipsed by the movement of Europeans in the 1840s (because of the illegalization of the slave trade, and instability within Europe, especially in Ireland).
 
•	40% of the traffic went to Brazil and 30% to the Caribbean. North America just imported 400K. This was fueled by warfare within Africa itself. Slaves were taken from rival tribes and war losers.
•	Once demand expanded, the warlords made slave capture a business to buy weapons. African traders and princes played a big role as middlemen in the process, leading to the Africanization of the Western hemisphere.
•	Brazil and the Caribbean were the targets because these were the places where the most people died, and these were also the location of the sugar plantations.
 
•	African hybrid systems were created: Candomble in Brazil, voodoo in Haiti.
 
•	Colonies were dedicated to the specialization of production for other people’s consumption. Here you see a fundamental problem in enterprise.
•	Africa shifted from being an exporter of gold to being an exporter of people.
•	The slave trade created transitions in the power of Africa and lead to the rise of new empires such as the Kongo Kingdom. This led to constant warfare and the extraction of slaves from the interior of Africa. 
•	What connected the Atlantic together was not just the institutions, but a bridge of violence and of exploitation.
 
6.4: Baroque Worlds
•	This was also a new cultural and intellectual age: in the creation of this Atlantic network, there was an exchange of cultures through marriage and trade.
 
•	Mestizo (mixed-race) child between Indian and European, Creoles (Black and European).
•	In this new world, elites would drink in sweetened beverages (from New World plantation) in cups imported from China. New races prayed to gods that their grandfathers had never heard of.
•	Indians amalgamate their old gods with Catholicism.
•	The Baroque: Portuguese term used to describe the beauty of a broken and uneven world, that it’s not a pure element and that in that impurity, something beautiful could be found. In this Baroque expressions, there are new ways of seeing the world, and you can find the dark realities lurking behind them.
•	Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz: She lived in Mexico, a learned, devout woman, a young Mexican Creole and had learned Latin and Greek. She thought that souls transcend both sex and race.
 
7.1: Indian Ocean Worlds
•	Indonesia: The Dutch would establish their outpost of Batavia. In this city, Chinese traders, Portuguese speakers, and Javans would construct a Baroque city in Southeast Asia. This would be an American (New World)-style of colony.
•	Banda Islands: The Dutch imported slaves from the rest of SE Asia to work this Dutch colony. On the volcanic hillside, forests would be cut down to produce furniture and ships for the Europeans as a staple of the Baroque style.
•	They would commercially produce spices here. This was where our palettes were changed, and these affected people’s daily lives.
•	As early as 1500, it was possible to wear cotton from India, eat from a bowl made of porcelain from China, with spices from Indonesia. It was a part of an expanding area of merchant ports.
•	Hormuz: Had to import water. Aden: Had to import food. Muslim traders knew had and knew how to import shit, nigga.
•	The rents produced merchant classes.
7.2: Pepper and World History
•	The luxury spices transition into a commodity.
•	Vasco de Gama: First person to skirt the Southern tip of Africa. The “Cape of Storms” was renamed to “Cape of Good Hope”, lol. By the 1490s, exploration, trade, and religion were intertwined.
•	Vasco de Gama had his own rules: he hijacked supplies in Mozambique and had a shootout in Mombasa, while discovering that he had evaded the Muslim blockade into the Indian Ocean.
•	While he needed local expertise, he had nothing to offer. He found a pilot: a legendary figure named Ahmad Ibn Majid.
•	Eventually, he makes it to Calcutta, with three dilapidated but unique vessels, with cannons. He knew that Calcutta had a ton of pepper, but his meeting with King Zamorin could not be more embarrassing. He had nothing to offer to King Zamorin for the pepper. As trade goods, these were worthless.
•	When he made it back to Portugal, he just had 2 vessels left, with very few pepper, but the pepper paid for the trip. This sent a ripple through Europe as the Venetians who had a hold on pepper speculated that their prices would go down, and the other Europeans now knew they could scramble around Africa and go directly to India.
7.3: European Empires in Asia
•	De Gama wanted to return to Calcutta and went on a rampage, killing sailors and burning ships to show Zamorin that he was no wimp. When Cabral went to Calcutta 2 years after, he bombarded it for 2 days. The Portuguese seized Goa, Molucca, and Hormuz. Sometimes they fought againt the Ottomans, sometimes they were fought off (such as in Aden), but the Europeans shot their way through the Indian Ocean.
•	The Portuguese were changing the balance of the world, and they would create new hubs in Asia. They chose, in 1516, an apothecary in Lisbon to send to China. When he arrived in 1517 in China, his gifts were returned to him because he did not understand the diplomacy in China: waiting was mandatory and he needed to declare himself as a subject to the Chinese.
•	By the time he arrived in the Forbidden China, the Chinese learned of the violence of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean, and in 1522 the Portuguese were executed and their bodies desecrated.
•	Because of Chinese wariness, Europeans were forced to trade in the outskirts of China. There was an arms race because the Philippines and Indonesia were the main outposts for someone who wanted to enter China.
7.4: Rivalries in Asia
•	Relying on predation meant that the Portuguese would not have the institutional infrastructure that the Americas had.
•	The Spaniards took Manila in 1571. Until then, most silver that flowed in China came from Japan. After 1571, it came from the Americas.
•	By 1597, 12M pesos travelled from Acapulco to China.
•	The Dutch were able to do the same thing because they had a financial instrument: credit. The Dutch also had their state: it had a pact between merchants and monarchs.
•	In 1602, a company called the Dutch East India Company was formed. This was a government-chartered firm that was certified by the government to allow the merchants to trade with the East Indies.
•	Because of this firm, the Dutch were able to shift from predation to exploitation. It was the biggest merchant fleet in the world. In 1619, they swept into Java and established a base there. By the 1660s, they were in control of a production and trading system.
7.5: Conclusion
•	For all of the cultural bullying, the Europeans had to adapt to existing institutions.
•	The Arab merchants needed to exploit the market, and they allowed the price of pepper to drop. Because the cost of deploying an empire was high, the Europeans had to pour more money while their businesses were getting losses.
•	The big East Asian dynasties were able to rely on themselves more, as opposed to the island sultanates. It’s only in these polities that Europeans were able to get into.
•	 Most of the time though, the Europeans would just get to the periphery to trade with the Asians. Even when they got in, they were pushed out, such as in India, China, and in Japan.
•	Regardless, this reordering of the world changed the balance of power.
•	1520s: Martin Luther and “The Freedom of Man” would intensify the rivalries between the powers of Europe. American Silver founded this reformation and their struggles. The Jesuits were founded in 1534 to maintain the order of piety.
•	Eventually it was a matter of harnessing resources from the rest of the world to fuel the violence in Europe, and there was a cycle of religious massacre in Europe in the 17th century, especially the 30 Years War.
•	1648 (Treat of Westphalia): ended war in Europe, but it left Spain indebted, and witnessed the growth of Holland, Britain, and France. This ended the dream of Europe being conquered by a universal monarchy.
 
8.1: Production
•	The explosion of world trade created vast pools of wealth.
•	What was different now was that wealth was emerging from various sources because of the increased specialization of entire societies to create things for other people’s production.
•	Societies were being constructed to produce for other people’s consumption, especially with the production of colonies.
•	Colonies were designed from the start to provide for other people. They were at the heart of global processes.
•	Oftentimes we don’t consume what we create. Jeremy doesn’t even read his own books lol. With an increase in specialization comes a decrease in self-sufficiency.
•	As opposed to the days that an artisan could create something on his own, with the rise of factories and division of labor.
•	When you are not self-sufficient, you can either offer your work (labor) or your specialization (skill), get money, and buy your bread, in the marketplace.
•	Paradox: As societies become more specialized, and as the world becomes wealthier, it also become more unequal.
8.2: Consumption
•	Increasingly, the wealth is getting concentrated in Europe (merchant capitalist class).
•	Europeans did this by limiting the indigenous people’s access to land.
Cluster Drugs
•	Ex: Cigarettes and caffeine.
•	Virginia: a colony for cigarettes.
•	Café: places to consume in the 17th-18th century. These were places to talk about daily events. These were places for marking rank and privilege. 
•	Sugar transforms the European grain-based diet to a sugar-based diet.
•	Merchants also needed to make sugar marketable. This led to etiquette changes and mass production of books, especially cookbooks.
•	New recipes: Christmas pudding, icing, cakes. “The icing on the cake is the story of globalization.”
8.3: Commodities and Companies
•	The Levant: a firm organized for trading in the Eastern Mediterranean. Merchants were frequently brokers between culture (Francis Leverett, the Turkey Merchant).
•	Other companies: Muscovy, The Royal African Company, The South Sea Company.
•	Merchants were no longer individuals, but companies. These wanted to exercise a monopoly in the production, distribution, and trade of commodities.
•	In order to get the monopoly, merchants reciprocate to the government a certain amount of spoils in the form of revenue, and as trade increases, the pool of capital creates more capital and it gets invested.
•	This is the fiscal-military state and it rests on a pact between merchants and monarchs.
Steps
•	Create an outpost somewhere in the world called a factory.
•	Get involved in direct colonization schemes.

•	Mercantilism: a new model of European empire that was different from the predator systems.
8.4: Organizing Markets
•	Mercantilism vs. Agrarian Dynasty/Feudalism (Mughal India, China)
•	This led to a distinction between political systems and an eventual clash between them.
•	We need a way of organizing the markets to make things work. One of these ways of organization was the stock exchange. Companies themselves become commodities.
•	First Stock Exchange: Amsterdam and London. A stock market was a place where people’s savings could be made disposable, and some people started to make money by trading the shares.
•	With increased liquidity from gold and silver, it was easier to move capital.
•	Bubble: It’s not an individual that stigmatizes a system. It’s a system that allows the formation of bad apples (speculators and swindlers and finance bubbles). 25% of the British debt was from the South Sea company, and eventually, the bubble burst, resulting in one of the first fiscal crises.
8.5: Mercantilist Wars
•	The fiscal-military states also involve relationships between states and not just between merchants. Monopoly pits rivals between one another. “I get a right to trade and you don’t, and the state is going to enforce my right.”
•	It’s hard to protect the protection racket. Rivals began to duke it out over these privileges, starting with proxies and privateers doing the dirty work for the states.
•	Sir Francis Drake: made money plundering and pillaging the Spanish galleons suckering the money. By 1715, they become out and out direct conflicts between mercantilist systems.
•	18th century Mercantilist Warfare: Rivals would fight against each other for the control of territory and sea lands. Theaters: North America, Caribbean, Africa, and it would culminate in the Seven Years War.
•	The result was that the imperial states who participated were increasingly indebted to the merchants, stock markets, and bond markets
•	Wars make money, money makes states, states make wars, but these can also undo political power.
•	One of the main zones of contention: South Asia.
 
8.6: Mughal Empire in the Vice
•	The heart of the Mughal Empire had moved south and it expanded through military conquest.
Three Pillars
•	Using marriage to combine households to create alliances and forge kinship networks.
•	Aristocratic nature of the empire: drawing wealth from the peasant communities through the use of tax collectors.
•	Military
•	The Mughal Empire was always a pluralistic one: while Muslim, there were Hindus, Sikhs, Jews, and other religions.
Akhbar the Great
•	Akhbar would consolidate the Mughal Empire and he would rely on these pillars (such as having several wives of different religions).
•	His court was multi-denominational and there would be a lot of influences involved.
•	He himself would have several important military campaigns against other holdouts in India.
•	The Peacock Throne (designed by the Shah Jahan, king of the world) was called the seat of power and was a source of great ceremonial display.
Threats
•	The Taj Mahal was a mirage: by the time the Shah unveiled his tomb to his wife, he was under a lot of threat.
•	Internal threats: the subordinated people resented that they were subordinated.
•	External threats: Europeans.
•	More war means more debt and more taxes needed.
•	Local elites begin to defect and seek out deals with the Europeans.
•	Cotton created new trading stations such as those in Madras and Bombay. 
•	The East India Company (1689) was the product of this mercantilist age, specializing in the sale of commodities of South Asia which will be traded to the Europeans.
•	Since the company didn’t have the military power to defend against the Mughal Empire, they needed to court their own allies to counterbalance Mughal authority.
•	The Mughals were eroded through a slow erosion of central power.
9.1: Beyond the Conquest and World Money
•	There was escalating violence with the forceful extraction and transfer of Africans to the new world.
•	The arrival of European traders and money began to erode the splendor of the Mauryan empire.
•	This began a steady state of warfare for South Asia. In the end, the Peacock Throne was raided by a Turkic tribe from Persia.
•	In Europe, new kinds of regimes were made. Once again, more wealth means an intensification in the source of power.
Europe’s Religious Divisions
•	Protestants vs. Catholics, Reformation vs. Counter-Reformation.
•	Spain, France, Portugal, all of them became heavily indebted, culminating in the 30 Years War (1618-1648) to draw boundaries over the conflicted lands.
•	The Treaty of Westphalia would in some ways lead to the modern borders today. Peace in Western Europe translated into war, and the rivalries in Europe go from inward directed towards outward directed.
 
9.2: China’s Transformation
•	China was able to bounce back from the Mongol conquests with the Ming Dynasty. It did emerge as a major importer of silver.
•	With the Manila galleon, there would be an open channel with the New World silver supplying Old World China.
•	Fully half of European imports in Asia would be paid in silver. Silver was that first commodity that Europe could provide which China needed.
•	Silver was needed because it was the basis of an effective tax system. Single-whip method: a land tax that would be payable in silver.
•	Due to the inflow of silver, there was a development of culture: private libraries, updated Tax and Imperial Exam, and a return to Confucianism.
•	To consolidate its power, the Ming turned its focus on the outer frontiers. The founder of the Ming dynasty argued that agriculture is the foundation of the nation, and Agrarian wealth is important for the underlying regime, and it was important to open new land in the periphery.
•	As money flowed in and silk flowed out, the Chinese would plant mulberry trees and groves at the expense of tropical forests.
9.3: China’s Reverberations
•	Japan looks like Europe: By the 16th century, it is beset by internal quarrels and civil war, with regional warlords (Daimyo) struggling for power.
•	There are times that crises can resolve themselves externally (the arrival of European missionaries can unite or destroy the country).
•	Geography: Japan is comprised of islands and is separated from the crossroads. Japan is also relatively homogenous, so there was a shared Buddhist faith, and there is a homogenous ethnic people, and they are close to China.
•	Japan had already fought off external aggressive armies before: the Mongols, the Portuguese, and the Dutch.
•	The Tokugawa shogunate would consolidate a united Japan against the Europeans and they would keep the Europeans to the outskirts.
Russia
•	Part of the drama with Korea was due to Russia. Silver flowed in through Poland and Lithuania, allowing trade.
 
•	As the Russians move eastwards, they would look for furs and pelts, especially beavers (their fur is prized for building top hats).
•	Not all of the Russian expansion was commercial; some of this was military. 
•	In 1722, Peter the Great created a capital for Russia in St. Petersburg.
9.4: Crisis and Transformation of Old Regimes
•	England: Parliament
•	France: Absolute Monarchy
•	Japan: Shogunate.
•	Grain riots coincided with the decline of New World silver. The shortage of liquidity led to a shortening of trade. Crises escalated.
•	The decline in silver output in the Americas caused an economic contraction in China. Because of the economic contraction, it put pressure on its population.
•	There was another external threat: Manchus in the north. Chinese dynasts needed to increase taxes drastically in 1618 and 1636, all of which compounded local social unrest.
•	Under a lot of social pressure, the Ming Dynasty had a peasant revolt.
•	Social banditry: peasants organized themselves (sometimes in the tens of thousands) in small bands to eke out a living.
•	The results of the conflict: depopulation, banishment, and the outskirts were reclaimed by the forests (including tigers), and the Ming dynasty was overthrown.
•	Lee Zicheng: A shepherd who promised land to the peasants, had an army of 200,000 soldiers. In April 1644, he would lead his troops into the capital Beijing.
•	The Ming collapsed so quickly because they were defending the north from the Manchus. When the Ming fell, the northern Ming armies were overran by the Manchus and by 1645, they were driven out of Beijing.
•	The Ming needed a military to support them, and the military needed money to back it. When the financial crisis hit, the military went down.
•	This is why economic crises have fiscal effects on the regimes.
9.5: China Resurgent
•	The Chinese do not follow the Mughal course: the new dynasty under the Manchus and the Qing had more imperial expansion.
•	China was still the world’s superpower, even with all its disasters (depopulation, climate change).
•	We can characterize this age as an age of discontinuities: the Manchus took the Chinese inwards. It took 40 years for Qing Conquistadors to establish their rule and move the power from Xing to Qing.
•	In the end, the Qing would consolidate the dynasty: straitjackets, shaved foreheads. A resource that they had was to turn to open up new lands for Han farmers to discover their identities and their loyalties to rulers, and to turn to the Chinese frontier.
•	To establish more land in the North and the West, the Manchu had a series of military campaigns. This brought them into a collision with the Russians.
•	There would be a complicated struggle between Russia and China over the interior of Asia.
•	The Chinese wanted to crush the tribal states of Mongolia in Turkestan. In order to do this, the Chinese needed to bring a supply of troops through to the hinterland. The epic expedition of 1696 turned into a chase across the Gobi with guerilla warfare.
•	In the end, Galdan’s only hope was to draw the Manchus deep into the Gobi and to hit the supply lines when they were stretched out, but he had too few troops.
•	Galdan’s body was brought to Beijing to celebrate Manchu heroism. In the end, his body was held out and desecrated not just as emblem of the defeated peoples, but to make sure that his physical presence was no longer there in the world.
10.1: Empire and Enlightenment
•	Regimes around Afro-Eurasia began the process of filling in the empty spaces, driven by the reorganization of political power, and the colonization of different spaces increased the velocity of different processes.
•	One example of this is through tea. Tea is interesting because it’s a tropical commodity and it was only produced in a few places in China. For a long time, China had a monopoly over stuff for a long time. Over the course of the 18th century, tea exports boomed in China.
•	Thinking about world history is about thinking about connections: in this case it is thinking about a good (tea) and an activity in the other side of the world (leisure houses).
•	This is where gentlemen would discuss the news of the day and the public sphere. From this forum will spread new ideas and the enlightenment.
•	One of the products of this tea is the birth of science, and the revolution of the press (books and newspapers), the most famous of which was Diderot’s Encyclopedia.
•	The Encyclopedia was supposed to collect all the knowledge scattered over the face of the earth.
•	Now, there was another purpose to travel the world asides from colonization: the Europeans could be going to Calcutta to study the world to add stuff to that encyclopedia.
•	Captain James Cook: His voyages in the South Pacific galvanized the European imagination. Cook was sponsored by the Royal Society to bring back the flora and fauna (including kangaroos) to Britain.
•	He also took people. From the European standpoint, they needed to know about the native people in the South Pacific. He was killed in Hawaii.
10.2: Collecting and Conquest
•	From 1725-1774, Robert Clive was devoted to science, but he was more devoted to its relationship to conquest, and in particular the conquest of Bengal in India.
•	At that time, the merchants needed to organize the use of large-scale fighting forces. The state used to franchise this part of the operation to private armies.
•	The East Indian Company would take control of the state of Bengal and Clive became its governor.
•	Clive also had a pretext for collecting: the exchange of gifts. When Clive, a former soldier, came back to England he fashioned himself as an aristocrat.
•	Clive and Cook represent the strategies that people took to support science and generate discoveries, which made up the Enlightenment.
•	The Enlightenment is an effort to understand the world without reducing its meaning to divine inspiration. What we want to do is to fathom the natural laws of the universe, and that the world itself is subject to rules and laws and regulations.
•	We want to figure those natural laws out and we want to literally understand the world.
•	In understanding the world, we see it as a totality that is subject to the same kind of laws and rules, no matter where you are. This is important to the birth of modern global history and social sciences.
•	It’s not just getting discoveries but also spreading them. Clive and others, collectors of information and artifacts, were the heralds of a new science. They would give rise in the interest of plants, fauna, and the peoples of the world. Scientists systematized the information into new bodies of knowledge, which we call the age of science.
 
10.3: Universal Laws
•	The idea is that nature can be molded and forged and this would lead to better, long-lasting, and more fertile plants.
•	Adam Smith was exploring the laws of human behavior and trying to capture the ways wherein there is an epic struggle within every man, and man’s passions had to give way to self-interest, and the universal laws could take place.
•	Smith believed in his faith in reason. “We can discover the meanings of these otherwise impure worlds and mysteries, and we can change them. We can take this scientific knowledge, harness it, and better our forms of government, and perfect man (and woman).”
•	The reality was that people are different all over the place.
•	Mary Wollstonecraft: “women too are reasonable (able to reason) and if we are left out, then how universal are these laws?”
•	In 1792, she would publish “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects”. The universal claims were often a guise of creating new patterns of social stratification.
•	This was a process that would ask about the universal claims of science.
•	It turns out that man was varied, and it was in these New World societies that the concept of race was born.
•	18th century: Races itself begin increasingly associated with skin color. The fact is that people try to systematize people and put them in boxes/castes. Ex: Spanish + Indian = Mestiza. Spanish + Moorish = Albino. Spanish + Mestiza = Castiza. Spanish + Mulatta = Murifca.
 
10.4: Imperial Reform
•	Can we use these new scientific laws to change the ways in which we practice empire? Science comes full circle to recast and reform empire.
•	Mercantilism argues that mercantilists need to find access to gold for wars and public powers of the state need to be put in a place that is more important than private acquisition.
•	It was the idea of monopoly rights (mercantilism) that was assaulted by the American revolution and Adam Smiths’ views.
•	Clive was the target for the kind of unease about what was happening in Bengal: is Britain being threatened by the practice of empire as violations of this Age of Reason?
•	Edmund Burke: He made a career of pointing out the corruption and vices of men who used public stations to benefit themselves.
•	He went up against one man in particular: Warren Hastings. Hastings had been bought by Clive into the East India Company and he would go on to succeed Clive and become the Governor-General of  Bengal.
•	“Every application of knowledge over the people that we exercise dominion over is useful to the state. It lessens the weight of the chain by which the natives are held and it imprints on the hearts of our countrymen the sense of obligation and benevolence. Such instances could only happen when the British domination of India would cease to exist.” (Once they are enlightened, they don’t have to be ruled by us.)
•	The Trial of Hastings: Hastings had accumulated wealth for him and his men by using only a state license. What was happening was that the public offices were being bought by the East India Company itself.
•	The belief by the Europeans was that it was their duty to spread the ideas of science and the enlightenment.
•	We now have a different model of empire: science changed the alchemy of the global system, we have the birth of social science, and a new challenge to make empires more rational and more virtuous.
10.5: Enlightenment or Empire
•	A man of reason had to query and prove things to be true, not merely assume them as true. Some began to query whether the empire was a good concept at all.
•	Was the empire a fundamental threat to the Enlightenment?
•	Many people in Europe were beginning to sense that Enlightenment ideas were incompatible with Imperial practices, and that the empire was sowing the seeds of its own destruction.
•	Argument: We are all fundamentally equal before the eyes of God. How do you believe in universal reason, and at the same time rule over the people who you do not think are capable of living in a civil society?
•	The “Noble Savage”: Native Americans were innocents but they had not received God’s word yet. They were living in the “Natural Society” and were “Natural Men”.
•	Jean Jacques Rousseau: “The Social Contract”. In civil society, we are in chains. There were oppressions in civil society which did not exist in the natural one.
•	Native people were being taken to be studied in Europe.
 
•	Benjamin West’s The Noble Savage. Who is more human at this point?
•	The worst part was with the treatment of Africans. Many enlightened men believed that the enslavement of Africans threatened to undermine the enslavers themselves. What’s happening is that god’s creatures are being enslaved.
•	Olauda Equiano’s Memoirs: He was an African slave that was released by his Christian owner. Commerce and trading was fine, but not the commerce and trading of peoples.
