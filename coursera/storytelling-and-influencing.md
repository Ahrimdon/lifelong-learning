# Week 1

- Persuasion: The action or process of changing someone's mind or behaviour to do or believe something different.
- Every person has a version of their truth, even if the information can help them.

## Lesson 1

### What is persuasive communication?

- Much of what is communicated is not understood.
  - Source, encoder, channel, decoder, recipient, and all those can have noise.
- Informing vs persuading - what are our intentions? If it's to inform, then maybe no need to persuade.
- You must understand what is important to the audience? What are their aspirations and fears, and why should they listen to me?
- If we like what we're hearing, then we will generate positive thoughts. And if we dislike what we're hearing, then we generate negative thoughts.
- How to know if they accept your message?
  - Verbal/non-verbal approval, "what do we do next".
  - "Why" is audience questioning your premise.
  - All presentations should be audience-centered.

### Assessing human behavior

- Everyone communicates differently.
- Don't take it personally - your unconscious mind makes meaning from things.
- Cause and effect - a small part of the population says "I am responsible for everything that happens in my life". This is different from being passive.
- Ecology - be ethical, because if people find out, that will ruin your reputation.
- Resources - Everyone has a limited amount of resources.
- Flexibility - They won't behave like you do unless you behave like them. Once you shift to be like them, they'll shift to be like you.

## Decision making

- If you don't shift what really matters, then they will go back to the way they are before coaching.
- People are motivated by values, and they are usually unseen by others.
- Imprint period (0-7) - sponges, observing the environment/parents.
- Search for unconscious values - "what's important to you about..."

## The Four Horsemen: The Antidotes

- Criticism: Verbally attacking personality or character.
  - Gentle start up: Talk about your feelings using "I" statements and express a positive need.
  - Instead of "you do this", talk about your feelings using "I" and express what you need in a positive way.
- Contempt: Attacking sense of self with an intent to insult or abuse.
  - Build culture of appreciation: Remind yourself of your partner's positive qualities, and find gratitude for positive actions.
  - These come from a position of moral superiority. Sarcasm, cynicism, name-calling, eye-rolling, sneering, mockery, and hostile humor. This is the greatest predictor of divorce - it is destructive and defeating.
  - 5:1 magic ratio of positive to negative interactions that a relationship must have to succeed.
  - Instead of: "you forgot to load the dishwasher again, you are so lazy", do "I understand you've been busy lately, but could you please remember to load the dishwasher when I work late?"
- Defensiveness: Victimising yourself to ward off a perceived attack and reverse the blame.
  - Take responsibility: Accept your partner's perspective and offer an apology for any wrongdoing.
  - Being defensive never helps to solve the problem at hand.
  - Instead of "It's not my fault that we're going to be late. It’s your fault since you always get dressed at the last second.", do "I don’t like being late, but you’re right. We don’t always have to leave so early. I can be a little more flexible."
- Stonewalling: Withdrawing to avoid conflict and convey disapproval, distance, and separation.
  - Psycho self-soothing: Take a break and spend that time doing something soothing and distracting.
