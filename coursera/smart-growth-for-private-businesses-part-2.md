1.2
•	As yourself how you would grow as a person
5th "P": People/Personal
•	Biz is a personal  sport. Generally speaking you will make money by adding value (products/services) to people.
•	You can't grow biz without people. You need dem employees.
•	Good employees aren't necc motivated by pay but it's how you treat people.
Attitude re employees
•	Theory X: People are a cost to be controlled and monitored. If you think people take advantage of you when you are good to them then you are in Theory X.
•	Theory Y: People are an asset.
1.3, 1.4
•	Your behaviors create meaning.
•	Employees finding meaning 
People want to feel good about their life, to feel they're not a failure, to feel that they'recontributing to the world. 
•	Do that and you get high engagement.
•	Growth is change. Growth won't occur unless you change.
6 Basic Transitions
•	Leadership: Doer->Manager->Leader
•	You start by doing everything. At some point you can't handle it, and that's when you become a manager.
•	Most people don't think about what it is to be a manager.
•	Technical competency: Functional specialist-> Generalist-> Conductor of an orchestra
•	Generally when you start out you are good at something and you are forced to learn the diff departments
•	Self-Interest: Me->Them
•	"My baby", "my idea", "my biz" and when you hire people you try to teach them what you want them to do because they aren't miny yous
•	You have to think, what motivates these people
Are you the right person
•	Are you still the best person to lead this business?
•	Or should you hire someone more qualified to do this?
1.5-1.6
1st Big Transition: From Doer to Manager
•	Growth changes when an entrep does and how she does it.
•	Most ents need to back off from "my way or the highway."
•	You need to delegate because there are more things to do than what you can.
•	Don't order, delegate.
•	Good delegators are good teachers.
CEO quotes
•	Delegation is not a natural act.
•	Delegation is the hardest skill for an ent to learn.
•	Delegation is the most difficult management skill to learn.
•	Delegation is baptism by fire: You start looking at the fact that if you don't let go, you will lose.
•	Delegation is hard because you think that your success would depend on other people doing their job well and serving their customers well and happy.
Delegation: The necessity and power of processes
•	Processes are the recipes or checklists of how to do something.
•	Processes reduce delegation risks and mistakes.
•	After each mistake is corrected, write a process. Leave a fire extinguisher behind.
Delegation: Best practices
•	Mistakes will happen, learn to live with the humanity of employees.
•	Expect mistakes, look for them, teach and correct.
•	People need to be comfortble making mistakes.
•	You need daily and weekly measurements.
•	Trust, but verify.
•	Quality, on-time delivery, cx satisfaction, efficiency, daily costs.
•	While people would like monetary rewards, people like recognition better.
•	Engage employees to write the processes.
•	Not one single point of failure: The biz can't fail if the employee didn't go to work!
•	Engage employees in measuring key indicators.
•	Encourage and reward self-reporting of mistakes.
•	NEVER delegate writing checks or using credit cards until you get really big, and if you do, have a check and balance.
•	DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO DO IT YOUR WAY.
1.7–1.8
2nd Transition: Becoming a leader
•	Managing managers is a teaching/coaching process.
•	Every manager is a different person and you have to learn how that individual learns.
•	People have different ways of fixing things.
•	You cannot lead until you have willing followers. Engaging followers takes time and EQ.
•	Learn to have respectful, difficult performance conversations with people.
•	Rehearse what you are going to say with others.
•	Critique the performance,  not the person.
•	Never correct managers in private—not in front of employees. You don't want your emps to lose confidence in their managers.
•	Basically you can manage 7 managers.
The paradox of growth
•	Ents become ents because they're tired of company rules, so they become ents.
•	When the company they built becomes bigger, they enforce structure, and they became managers and they created structures (which they hated).
•	That's why some ents say "I'm happy here, if I move further, it would suck for me".
3rd Transition: Becoming a mentor/coach
•	As your biz grows to 100+ employees, you have to build a Senior Management Team.
•	"No one told me I'd be more a psychologist than a biz person."
•	"It takes one set of skills to run a company, and a different set of skills to grow."
•	As you push down you have to devote more stuff to alignment and making sure people are focused on the right things.
•	People need to have the right skill sets.
4th big transition: From specialist to generalist
•	Many ents have a business specialty when they worked for someone else.
•	When you start a biz, you need to generalize.
6th: From me to them
•	One learns quickly that one's biz success in most cases is dependent on others (employees) and keeping others (customers) happy.
•	Most biz are people biz.
•	Learn to teach, listen to, engage with, relate to, and inspire people.
•	We have to learn how to build that stuff.
1.9
•	Barbara Lynch case: amazing personal and biz story.
•	Age 7: Smokes 10 cigs and drank Heinken.
•	Good at Home Economics, dropped out from high school.
•	She worked random jobs until she was asked if she was a chef, she said "yes" even without exp. "Fake it till you make it!" and "I'm not scared to try."
•	She was not afraid of failure!
•	She moved to Italy to learn how to cook Italian food, another risky move.
•	First venture failed, she lost $250K.
•	Second venture failed: split with operating partner.
•	She hired a COO. COO laid down the foundation for ops, acctg, etc.
•	In order to grow she had to trust, let go, train, and mentor other chefs.
 
1—Case Study: Barbara Lynch Gruppo
Lynch the Entrepreneur
•	34: First restaurant, she raised equity from wealthy Bostonian food lovers.
•	Paid back investors in three years.
Expansion
•	Failure to grow an Italian restaurant in the North End: $250K hit.
•	Undettered, she set up B&G Oysters and The Butcher Shop.
•	She was fortunate in that her full-time employees stayed, on average, from three to five years at BL Gruppo because she gave them the opportunity to grow professionally, earn an average of $35,000 to $55,000 a year, and receive a good benefit package that included company contributions to health and dental insurance, enrollment in a 401(k) plan after one year of employment, and paid time off.
•	Colin Lynch worked 13 days out of every two weeks, averaging 85 hours a week. Work hours usually started at midday and lasted past midnight.
•	To help build that team spirit, all kitchen staff came to work at the same time and all stayed till the wee hours of the morning until everyone was finished, so they left the building as a team.
Challenges for 2012 and Beyond
•	Maintaining consistent excellence was an ongoing major organizational challenge that depended on the nightly behavior of hundreds of her team players.
•	The restaurant business was also one that, in most cases, did not stay in operation beyond the business life of its founding chef. Creating value generally came from current operations and not from monetizing projected growth or future earnings absent a focused food concept that can be scaled geographically (e.g., steak restaurants like Morton’s).
•	Lynch also understood that her position should be behind the stove and not in front of it as a public persona.
1—Case Study: Global Medical Imaging
If you’ve got the wrong people in the wrong seats, no amount of rules or processes will get the right behavior. The right people in the right seats will overcome any problems; they’ll put in any processes you need, they’ll fix any issues you have, because they’re the right people. Focusing on that early on can save the organization a lot of money and accelerate growth.
GMI's Biz Model
•	First market: Small, private-practice doctor's office.
•	As the population aged, demand for ultasounds grew. The ents decided to offer reconditioned machines for sale.
•	From day one, they had a number of quality control processes in the reconditioning facility.
•	New revenue stream: Field-service engineers, cx support reps.
Biz infrastructure
•	Outsourced code to a sw company.
•	Problem with employee theft early on.
•	Maybe they could have invested mor slowly? They believed that anything they invested would make money back in the long run.
Growing pains
•	Rule of seven: Over seven and it's harder because there are too many people doing stuff so hard to check it out.
•	Employees who were unable to grow in the company were moved down.
•	45-55 employees: They hired a professional management team.
Hiring
•	They were too fast in hiring, this was definitely a mistake.
•	Recognize superstars, redirect or retrain B players, and weed out underachievers or C players.
•	A hiring mistake at any level costs more than the emp's original salary.
Building the company
•	CFO: Software is very important because you can't guarantee the cash flow next month.
•	HR: They should have hired an overqualified HR person so they wouldn't have the cost of hiring mistakes.
•	Compensation: At some point they offered equity in addition to compensation.
•	Metrics: Financial and "soft" ones such as teamwork.
•	Growth: "I got to the point that I couldn’t manage a $17 million business the same way I managed the $12 million business. Because of the pace at which we growed, about every six months we’re almost a new organization."
From Doing Everything to Delegating
•	If you delegate out 10 major parts of your day, and six people grab that and are doing great, and maybe four of the folks aren’t the right people, you grab those four things back, but at least you got rid of six.
•	Strategic Coach: Stick to the three or four tasks they performed extremely well and delegate the rest.
•	Fast-growing businesses outgrow people quickly. Everyone  you hire must grow quickly too.
Business is a game like baseball or golf or anything else. I enjoy being a student of the game, and reading, and learning, and going to conferences, whether it’s building custom homes or selling or servicing medical equipment. A good entrepreneur can be a good entrepreneur in any industry because if you’re a student of the game, the rules and the lessons are very much the same. And that’s the fun part about it.
 
1— Growth Is The Dynamic Confluence Of Strategy, Entrepreneurship, And Values (196)
•	Consistent value creation requires a focused strategy that is implemented through a mixture of entrepreneurial activities and exploiting activities enabled by an internal system characterized by values-based (ethical) leadership, culture, and policies.
•	Growth happens when the right kind of leadership, internal environment, and processes come together to create a small-company-entrepreneurial soul in a large-company body.
Read later
 
2.1—Employee Engagement
•	You, as the ent, have a ton of transitions to do.
•	No quick fixes or easy formula, a biz is complicated.
99% of the people out there want the exact same thing: to feel good about their life, to feel they're contributing, and to be part of something that has a positive impact on their kids and families. It is part of the human condition, the need to contribute.
•	You as the ent need to create the right culture and environ.
•	Ex: Janitor in a clinic works so hard cleaning. "We fix hearts and my job is to kill the germs. The germs hurt the hearts."
•	What you want to say is "I have never hired an employee, because I ask them to join me in my mission."
•	First question to managers: "Are you a jerk? Because no jerk works here."
•	Employees love good managers, and together they'll love the cxes.
 
2.2-2.3-2.4-2.5
Key points
•	As a biz grows, the ent's success becomes more and more dependent on others.
•	It's critical to hire the right people.
•	Glasses half-full, or glasses half-empty?
•	You want to hire people who WANT TO LEARN. Constant improvement. We're only as good as our last meal, our last product delivery, our last customer.
•	If you don't want to learn, stay home.
•	It's critical for the ent to be a "people person", with good people skills.
Ask yourself: Why should someone follow you?
•	Are employees a means to an end, or are employees an end?
Success depends on teaching, motivating and relating, and on a daily basis, engaging employees and managers in the pursuit of excellence and high performance.
High Performance Organizations
Even if you know these principles, you will fail if you do not execute.
•	Simple, focused strategy/elevator pitch: Every single employee  knew what the hell they were doing.
•	Structures that enable ent behavior: "Small company soul in a large company body."
•	Higher purpose than shareholder value/profit: Money is not enough. Meaning doesn't come from money.
•	Culture of relentless, constant improvement: The DNA of growth.
•	High employee engagement: An implied social contract, an accountable "family". If you play by the rules, the company will take care of you.
•	Customer centricity & closeness: Being better is more important than being bigger.
•	Humble, passionate operators who are values-based leaders—devaluation of elitism.
•	Execution & service champions: Excellence everyday, every way, by everyone.
•	An internal, aligned, consistent, self-reinforcing System (strategy, culture, structure, HR policies, leadership, etc) that enables, motivates, and rewards desired behavors.

 
What is high employee engagement?
•	Employees are emotionally engaged and personally invested in great work.
•	Employees view their work as more than a paycheck.
•	Employees are proud of where they work.
•	Employees find meaning and emotional satisfaction in being part of your business.
•	Employees find meaning and emotional satisfaction in the purpose of their work.
Money is not enough
•	You cannot buy long-term emp engagement.
•	Raises have benefits for roughly seven days, then your body adjusts.
•	Give your emps the opp to be the best that they can be.
What was your best job ever?
 
2.6
What do employees want?
•	Part of your answer to "what was your best job" is related to your direct boss.
•	Good intentions are not enough, your behavior matters.
•	When an employee has an idea, don't "yes, but" them.
•	"Yes but" is "I'm smarter than you" or "I thought of that earlier".
•	Change from "Yes, but" to "Yes, and".
•	The more you say "yes, and", the more the employees were engaged and people seemed to like it better.
•	Emps want to have an input in how they do  their jobs.
•	Emps want you to help them  grow and advance.
•	The best thing to do with emps is to train them, nothing says "I care about you"
 more than that.
•	Emps want frequent and fair feedback.
•	They want to see a chance if they can do it or not.
•	Emps want to be treated with respect.
Fundamental leadeship principles:
•	The golden rule.
•	Take care of our people. Treat them the right way and give them opportunities to advance.
•	Lead by example.
•	Do what's right.
The domino effect
•	Start asking yourself, what did I do wrong (or what did I do right)?
•	Leadership cascades down an organization.
•	People think it's OK to treat other people like they are treated by their own bosses.
•	A leader's own body language is supes importante.
•	Not everything is perfect but you can deliver messages in a way that would make sense.
 
2.7
 
 
•	Check out which of these you need to work on.
 
2.8
•	It takes about 4-6 months to change your habits and behavior.
•	Being nice to employees doesn't mean that you are soft to your employees.
•	You can have high standards (hold people accountable), and have HEE.
Common chars of HEE
•	Employees have a sense of ownership.
•	Emps have training and educ opps to grow.
•	"Promotion from within."
•	Constant comms about values and standards.
•	Highly accountable family env.
•	Consistent and fair rewards/promotion policies, if you change in the middle, people won't trust you.
•	Information transparency. "I trust you."
•	Same set of behavioral rules (not necc same compensation) for everyone, elitism is devalued. Not doing this creates cynicism.
•	Hiring on cultural fit. You do not want to cram this.
•	Celebration of learning and success.
•	Emotional rewards.
•	Clearly defined zero-tolerance policies. Includes managers and family members.
 
2.9
•	You have to create your own "secret sauce".
•	Def, you can still fail because you need cx value, ops, etc...
•	Trilogy: "All of our cx don't want to be here."
Trilogy Health Services
"If we take care of our emps, they take care of our cx, and we have a bottom line."
•	Culture of compassionate service.
•	Nurturing env for frontline emps.
•	Leads, doesn't direct, emps.
•	We work hard on humility.
•	We have zero tolerance on ego and politics.
•	Competitive benefits.
•	Monthly recognition party.
•	Invests in emp training.
•	Speak to everyone within 10 feet of you and engage with all people.
•	Reinforces cx service principles with posters and payroll stuffers.
•	Constantly comms with the company during coffee breaks.
•	Hires the right people: "Do you love the elderly?"
•	Is honest about the difficulties of the job during the hiring process.
•	Has a rigorous on-boarding process.
•	Honors new hires at six months with a celebration.
•	Referrals are better than references.
•	Fears complacency and ignorance.
•	Continuous improvement.
Leadership talk
•	One-worder: "Please." Don't give commands.
•	Two-worder: "Thank you."
•	Three-worder: "I am sorry." "I am wrong." Everyone knows you were wrong anyway.
•	Four-worder: "May I help you?"
 
2.10—Conversation with Randall Bufford (Trilogy)
If you're building a biz, where do you start when you're past the startup phase?
•	Start with your mission and your vision and your values.
•	Start with your actions first so that there is an alignment with the values.
•	Make sure that everything you do fits with the values.
•	2nd: Servant leadership by taking care of emps.
How do you operationalize values?
•	LBE: Leadership by example.
•	New people inherit the behaviors of the people who are already there.
•	Constant repetition. :)
•	Constantly report on what's happening.
Trust between owner and employees
•	By giving info you create ownership for our homies.
•	Choose to lead people, not direct them. Leadership means engaged employees.
•	Choose performance over conformance.
•	Employees are there not because they have to, but because they want to.
What goes through your mind going to work?
•	Build organizations for the right reasons.
•	In order to be the best in what you do, you lead with passion.
•	Ask yourself, are you making a difference in the lives of others?
•	Just be consistent, always.
•	Badges and stuff to reward homies.
The job's never done, right?
•	You do not want to do something that is counterintuitive to the company culture. Be paranoid and sensitive about this. This is easy to violate when you are growing. 
•	You have to invest very heavily in the soft parts of the biz (culture, educ, training).
 
2—Case Study: Trilogy Health Services, LLC
•	Trilogy Health Services, LLC, (Trilogy) was a privately held senior-living-services company.
•	Under Bufford’s leadership, Trilogy grew to 17 facilities in seven years.
•	Trilogy’s culture—with its emphasis on people and service before earnings—formed the company’s competitive edge.
Trilogy Health Services: A Cash-Starved Start-Up
•	1997: No capital coming into a capital-intensive company.
•	They took loans with 22% interest just to save the company.
The Trilogy Health Campus
•	Through research he learned that the elderly preferred to stay at home and receive any needed health-care services in the least-restrictive setting and were willing to pay for such services.
•	Very personalized care for seniors.
•	Bufford asserted that the best way to ensure customer satisfaction was to create a nurturing environment for Trilogy’s front-line employees—the caregivers, nursing assistants, nurses, and others.
•	He and his management team worked hard to promote “the kind of culture where our employees feel supported by a culture that says, ‘No person is any more important than others.’”
"We read books as a company."
•	When gasoline prices were rising, every full-time employee who had been with Trilogy six months or longer was eligible for a $30-a-month subsidy to cover increasing commuting costs.
•	Once a month we do a recognition party; we call it the ER3 party. If it’s your six-month anniversary—you get recognized. If you have perfect attendance—you get recognized. If you had a baby or your daughter-in-law had a baby, we give you a Trilogy baby onesie. All those things create an environment where it’s going to be a little easier not to get burned out.
•	At Bufford’s direction, Trilogy emphasized employee education and training early on.
Recruiting
•	We want to find somebody who’s looking for a compassionate return, who is not there just to pick up a check, because that person is not going to find satisfaction in the difficulties we face.
•	New hires wore blue name badges. “The idea behind it is that we all know you’re new, we’re giving you extra love, we’re telling you that we want to celebrate that badge turning white with you.”
•	We hire the wrong people, or the people we hire say the right things in the interview process, but they really don’t mean it when it comes to how hard we work and not playing politics.
•	We’ve never gotten great results out of the reference process, but we’re trying to intensify that from a networking standpoint, trying to find people who have known this person in employment in our communities, versus what this person puts on their reference sheet.
Trilogy’s Growth Strategy
•	Bufford’s expansion efforts centered on underserved, nonurban markets.
•	For Bufford, successful culture transfer started with getting the right people on a new facility’s management team.
•	The select candidates for top management positions were routinely invited to spend time on Trilogy’s health campuses about 120 to 180 days before the hiring process started.
Leadership of Continuous Improvement
•	Even though we have a central office, our business really happens in the field.
•	If I don’t put my feet on the floor every day, thinking about how this organization’s going to get better, and if our employees and our executives aren’t doing the same exact thing, we got a good shot at going backwards.
Mission Statement
•	We are committed to exceeding our customer’s expectations.
•	The right employees make the difference.
•	The team approach works best.
•	Pay attention to the details.
•	Take what the company is doing very seriously but not yourself.
 
3.1-3.2
Room & Board Case Study
•	Es is an attitude and a framework.
•	It's a process of growth.
•	For people to change and biz to change, you have to learn. If you want to be innovative, you have to learn!
You want to hire employees who like learning.
•	Always ask your employee what they learned yesterday? What we want is to build a learning culture.
•	What is the essence of leadership and high performance?
Everyone just wants to be loved. Employees want the same thing as you: to be respected, to do something they can be proud of, to be hiven the opportunity to be all that they can be.
•	The number one cause of business dysfunction is leadership arrogance.This can become personal or intellectual (when you think you know everything).
•	No jerks allowed!
•	When you come in to a case study, you want to get early to see how people act, the guards and the ladies etc. Room and Board: people come at 8:30 and leave at 5:00.
•	It's not the number of hours, it's the productive hours that your want.
Good growth biz are like ice cream
•	They come in different flavors: there's no "one way" to build a great biz.
•	Common principles
•	Growth requires strategic focus, constant improvement and cx centricity.
•	Growth requires consistent, excellent execution.
•	Growth requires you to deliver high quality products/services on time, in volume.
•	Growth requires the right people and the right leadership.
Growth is much more than a strategy
•	"2 inches wide and 2 miles deep."
•	Do something very well that lots of people need.
•	4 P's: Planning, prioritization, pace, and processes.
•	Execution is as important as strategy—what do you need to execute well?
 
Growth is behavioral
•	Growth results from the actions (behaviors) of employees.
•	If you want employees to do something, measure it.
•	If you want employees to do something well, measure AND reward it.
•	Behaviors produce financial results.
How do you get employees to do what is necessary?
•	Get to define the behaviors that you want. Is it teamwork? Is it constant improvement? Is it on-time delivery? Is it cx responsiveness? Is it the speed of answering the phone?
•	Then, communicate the desired behaviors.
•	Measure/reward
•	Role model
•	Inspire those behaviors through culture and messaging.
•	Teach the behaviors.
•	Create the environment that promotes and enables those behaviors.
This is a system... The system allows you to set these defined behaviors.
•	You can never stop talking about what you need to do. There's always something you can do.
•	Constantly ask yourself what you want the organization to do and check if everything is aligned and the messages are consistent.
•	Everything must be in harmony. R&B is a case about harmony: there is a consistency between what you feel and what you do. People buy into the culture and there is a commonality of behavior and purpose.
3.3
What is a system?
•	A combination of things or processes that work together to produce a more complex result.
•	You have to have all the parts working together: culture, leadership behavior, measurement, reward, and defining behaviors you need for the business model.
•	Start defining three or four key behaviors and align the system to send consistent, self-reinforcing messages.
•	If you think you've got things right, then there's a problem because you can always improve things.
 
Building a growth system
•	It's a constant work-in-progress.
•	You constantly have to improve it and you have to be sensitive to mixed messages and unintended consequences.
•	You must be paranoid about inconsistency and hypocrisy.
3.4
•	Everybody is not going to behave the right way, and destructive behaviors cannot be overlooked.
•	Employees must trust the system: If they work hard and play by the rules, then they will win. Don't change the f-in rules in the middle of the game!
•	There must be one set of behavioral rules—not different rules for employees and leaders.
•	Managers and leaders have to fight elitism and a sense of entitlement daily. Remember: Everyone wants the same thing that you want!
•	In the good companies, the CEOs have the same facilities and the same offices as the employees.
•	Managers and leaders have to fight elitism and a sense of entitlement daily.
 
3.5
R&B Case Study
•	Based on: Quality and relationships.
"At R&B we hope you find meaning in your work. There is both tremendous productivity for the company and personal fulfillment for the staff member if someone finds their life's work wonderful. It's a wonderful circle of success."
•	We want to find people that find meaning in what they do. We will pay them very well.
R&B's DNA
•	Quality products
•	Quality relationships with suppliers, employees, and cx. 
I just want to spend my time with good people doing something more meaningful than just making money or keeping score.
Quality products
•	Designs, builds, and sells classic, timeless, simple designs made of exceptional quality materials that will be fashionable for a long time. (That's his customer value proposition.)
•	When you spend money in R&B, it should last.
•	"Cost per use".
•	Salespeople have no commisssions: He wants his cx to be sure that the advice they're getting is not tainted by whether they make money on that advice or if the money is tied to the more expensive products.
•	95% cx satisfaction
•	Gives cx the ability to enjoy their furniture for a long time.
Quality relationships with suppliers
•	Almost all suppliers were small, family-owned biz based in the US.
•	R&B was a big customer—products were made exclusively.
•	John talks with the suppliers themselves as to how much  R&B made that year.
•	John wants to make sure that his suppliers were making a fair living in the same way that we was making a fair living.
 
Quality relationships with employees
•	Culture: Principles of trust, respect, and collaboration.
•	Trust:
•	Principles, not rules.
•	Strategy disclosure.
•	Financials are disclosed monthly (all employees come).
•	Shared accountability (I trust that you're not going to take advantage of me because you're an adult and you understand your responsibility.)
•	Employees have a non-work life too (8-hour work day).
•	Full-time employees with benefits.
Quality relationships with customers
•	We want customers for life.
•	We will help you design your special home or space—mass speedy customization.
•	No sales or discounts to anyone, you can rely on getting the best price.
R&B: Happy employees
•	Work-life balance
•	Perks & benefits
•	Physical fitness facility at headquarters, healthy lunches, personal financial planning.
3.6
R&B Key Expectations
•	Respect is foundational to our work environment.
•	Use good judgment and apply the principle, not just the rule.
•	The more you understand how your role contributes to our business objective and is tied to its success, the more rewarding work will be.
R&B Management Principles
•	Take ownership of the biz, you're independent so do not wait to be told what to do.
•	Lead less with rules and rely more on principles.
•	Collaboration is much more important that competition.
•	Appreciate and desire longevity in your role, your growth comes not from location or department moves but from richer experiences within your current role.
 
John built a contrarian biz model
•	Different source of product
•	Diffferent control of pricing (no sales)
•	Mass customization as opposed to mass distribution
•	Low employee turnover
•	No sales commission
•	Average employee tenure with the company > 5 years.
3.7
UPS Case Study
•	40K employees, world-class operational excellence, over 100-year old company
•	Highly engaged employees
•	Low turnover
•	Promotions from within
•	Anti-elitist culture
•	Employees are "free agents" (you can apply to other companies)
Three-prong UPS culture
•	Performance culture with mutual accountability up and down.
•	The CEO is accountable to the employees and employees can call the CEO.
•	Everyone eats in the same cafeteria.
•	Constant improvement driven by "constructive dissatisfaction".
•	Everyone has a duty to make suggestions on how to make things better.
•	No being satisfied and being complacent.
•	Employee-centric organizational culture.
We are all in this together, and if we all do our part, we will get rewarded.
•	Everyone needs to be engaged in the pursuit of excellence. It doesn't matter whatever you're selling. The principles go across industries and cultures.
What is the purpose of my business? Ask yourself what the cx would say when they are asked, "why should your biz  exist?"
 
3—Case Study: Room and Board
Supply Chain
•	Instead of outsourced labor, R&B chose to create a supply chain of 40 different privately owned family biz.
•	Room & Board met with its vendors frequently to plan growth, discuss needs, and share financials to ensure that everyone was making a fair living while creating high-quality, well-designed products.
Culture
•	Room & Board had rejected common attributes of private-company culture: hierarchy, command and control from the top, information on a need-to-know basis, and, in the retail industry, high turnover resulting in customer-service challenges.
•	Its culture was based on the principles of trust, respect, relationships, transparency, entrepreneurial ownership of one’s job and career, and the importance of a balanced life.
•	Harmony exists when what you feel, what you think, and what you do are consistent.
•	Most people only have so many productive hours a day—it is the number of productive hours that count, not the number of hours at work. We strive to have an environment which results in energy and productivity.
•	People who have a balanced life, with a life outside work, were happier and dealt well with customers and with each other.
•	Satisfaction: Tracking how many employees referred family and friends for jobs and how many employees participated in the company’s 401(k) program.
•	They had their own delivery employees which were trained in the R&B culture.
•	Time was allotted for cx interaction and fixing stuff.
No sales, no volume discounts, no discounts for interior designers: " Nothing makes me madder than to buy something and then see it go on sale."
 
Leadership
•	You take ownership for your business—you’re independent and therefore do not wait to be told what to do.
•	You lead less with rules and rely more on principles.
•	You value building relationships; collaboration is much more important to you than competition.
•	You appreciate and desire longevity within your role. You do not seek to move from location to location or from department to department to get ahead; your growth occurs from richer experiences within your current role.




 
4.1
•	You have to constantly check back and think what's going on. 
•	You also have to prioritize what to spend your time on.
•	We talk about system and alignment and culture and leadership and everything must be aligned to be consistent.
•	This week is about senior management and making them play nice with each other.
•	It's not easy to upscale people: There are people who are briliant employees but are not good managers.
CEO quotes
•	You have to dump stars who are not nice.
•	Eighty percent of people who started with me are no longer here, because they could not grow with the business.
•	One negative person can impact five, 10, 15 in a small company.
•	My biggest mistakes were hiring too quickly and firing too slowly.
•	I have yet to be successful in putting somebody on a different seat and their ego being able to handle.
Growth
•	Growth is change. Growth requires the ent, employees, processes, etc. to change as the business grows.
•	Growth is evolutionary—it evolves and everythingin the business is continuously evolving, including people.
•	Growth requires more processes and more/better management.
•	Growth eventually requires you to build a management team.
Sad truth: In most cases, the team that can manage a small biz is not the best team to lead a large biz.
•	People need to grow quickly or new people have to be hired.
Hiring senior managers is hard
•	It is one of the hardest things ever. Many of the CEOs said that they usually took 3-5 hires to find their CFO, CTO, head of sales, etc.
 
4.2
Why is hiring so hard?
•	Ents have a hard time evaluating technical competencies of people.
•	Ex: It's hard to find good accountants if you are a salesperson. You aren't sure if they're bullshiting you or not.
•	How exactly do you evaluate technical competence if you haven't done it yourself?
•	Poor hiring process.
•	Higher growth creates urgency to hire quickly.
•	Failure to hire for cultural fit.
•	They underestimate the difficulty that "corporate types" have in transitioning to small companies.
4.3
A surprising large number of management teams are dysfunctional.
•	Every family business is dysfunctional, it's a matter of degree.
•	You can get large dysfunctional results if people view each other as competition and when people are not open and honest, and when people think of the company as a race.
•	Everyone has to be accountability. It is a team sport and not a sport of stars.
Personal dynamics
•	Every hire increases the number of personal dynamics-related nodes.
•	People are scared to be honest with each other.
•	There is personal competition and politics.
•	A large part of people's bonuses should be dependent on the company's performance.
The need to upgrade
•	You will often have to hit someone when you upscale. There is an effect on the loyalty etc.
•	You find that sometimes people can move to another seat and sometimes they can't.
•	The need to upgrade never ends.
Upgrading creates tension
•	Big conflict between loyalty to people and needed capabilities
•	Stressful: "Am I the next to go?"
4.4
Ex: HR
 
•	Do you promote someone to manager if they haven't done it before?
•	You have to take into consideration the speed at which you're growing, if too fast then you might need to hire from outside.
Managing the risks of hiring
•	Hire people you know well or people known well by someone you trust.
•	Hire slowly—deliberate process.
•	Find people you trust.
Hiring bias
•	People tend to hire people who have similar interests and are more like them. That's why you have to have different people in the hiring process.
•	Cultural fit is important.
•	Be cognizant to the immediate reactions of people because people can't fake it.
•	Have a trusted advisor who can evaluate talent for you.
 
4.5
•	Good hiring is just the first step. You then have to think if the new manager will be accepted or rejected by the employees.
•	Have you explained the reasons for the hire?
•	Some firms had to hire psychologists to deal with team dysfunction. (wat)
•	Can the ent learn to coach/mentor each senior manager as an individual? You have to relate to each person as an individual.
•	If you don't enjoy the HR, you have to get someone who does.
The challenge of having difficult conversations
•	I want a stab-me-in-the-chest culture, not a stab-me-in-the-back culture.
•	It's never easy, but it becomes easier.
Great biz are great teams
•	Teams can have high performance players.
•	Be wary of selfish stars.
 
4.6
First manager hire?
•	It depends on the biz, your skills and capabs are.
•	What is your critical need? Revenue? Processes? Hiring large numbers?
•	Many ents hire someone with skills to complement their skills.
•	Usually, you hire someone who has different capabilities than you.
Types of experience
•	Do you hire someone who has helped scale an ent biz?
•	How much scaling exp?
•	Do you hire someone who has worked in larger non-ent companies?
•	Can a "large company" person adjust to a fast-paced env?
Number 1 lesson from research
Hire slowly and fire quickly.
•	Successful ents lament taht they made way too many mistakes by feeling pressured to hire quickly and poorly.
•	No ent ever has said "I fired someone too quickly."
Hiring is more than a selling process
•	Ent is selling that this is a good place to work. Hire is selling that they're the best guy for the job.
•	Does the person have the capabilities to fit?
 
4.7—SecureWorks
•	Mike Cote was brought in when sales were at $1 million.
•	January 2011: SW was sold to Dell for $600M.
Cotes' management challenges
•	Getting managers to take ownership and make decisions.
•	"Stop talking before I stop listening."
•	"Don't 
•	Getting managers to spend their time on the right things.
•	"The enemy is not in this room."
Growth is change
•	Every six months, Cote reorganized the company.
•	Companies hit process and people walls at $5m, $10-15m, and $25m in revenue.
•	"If you boil it all down, it's people, people, people."
