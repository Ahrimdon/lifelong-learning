# Week One (Module 1)

## 1.1: Introduction

Astrobiology forces us to address philosophical questions that strike at the very core of our civilization. If the answer to this question is, no, we are not alone in the universe, we're also faced with some very fascinating questions. What is the nature of this other life on other planets? Is it microbial life? Life like bacteria? And, if so, how does it compare to life on Earth and where is it? Or is it intelligent life? And if it is intelligent life, what is the nature of this other intelligence? Can we communicate with it? And what will be the consequences if we do communicate with it? Are we alone in in the Universe is unquestionably the one question in astrobiology that fires the imagination of the general public. And it's probably the question that brought you a long to this course. It's a very reasonable question to ask. When you think about the Universe that we live in. 

The planet on which we live orbits a single star and this star is one of about 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. And our own galaxy is probably one of many, many billions of galaxies throughout the Universe. In truth we don't know how many galaxies there are in the Universe, it may be something on the order of 100 billion galaxies maybe more, but if you think about it 200 billion stars in our own galaxy, possibly 100 billion galaxies throughout the universe, it seems reasonable to ask the question is there life on other planets? And that is why astrobiology is concerned with a question for yet which we do not have an answer, but which scientifically, empirically looks like a reasonable question to ask. 

To search for life on other planets, we first of all have to understand something about life on our own home planet, Earth. This is a rather beautiful image taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts on the surface of the moon. And it shows the Earth hovering above the horizon of the moon. It's sometimes called the Blue Marble image. Because it shows a picture of the Earth as a tranquil planet, it looks like a very peaceful place. For this belies the history of life on Earth and the future of life on this planet. For example, we know that planet Earth has been struck by large pieces of rock in its past. Astroid and comet impacts that have done devastating things to life on the surface of the earth. We think, for example, that the dinosaurs were made extinct by such an asteroid impact 65 million years ago. Now, whether an asteroid really did kill the dinosaurs, is something that is controversial in some parts of the scientific community. But whatever one's views about this, the fact that scientists proposed that the extinction of the dinosaurs was caused by an asteroid, shows that in order to understand the past history of life on Earth, we have to understand its connection with the cosmic environment. What sort of rocks might come from outer space and threaten life on the Earth? 

In a few billion years from now, our Sun will come to the end of its life. And, at that point, our own planet will be completely destroyed and all life on it will be extinguished. That's not for a long time to come. But we do know that, in order to understand the future of life on a planet, its long term future, we must think about the connection of a planet, again, with its cosmic environment, how it connects with the history of its parent star and how long that star lives, and therefore, how long you can expect life to survive on a planet. So in order to understand life on Earth, we have to understand the past history of life and its connection with the cosmic environment. And we have to understand the future of life on earth and its connection with the cosmic environment. In other words, an understanding of life on earth is really about studying astrobiology, the connection of life with its astronomical or cosmic environment. 

Astrobiology is first interested with understanding the origin of life on this planet, how did it come about? And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists ask and that we'll be looking at in this course, are how did life originate on this planet? Where did life originate? What where the locations of the first organisms to emerge on this planet; where might they have first evolved? Is life an inevitable process on any planet where the conditions are good enough? Do you always get an evolution of life? Is this a common process throughout the Universe? When did this happen? Did it happen very quickly after the Earth was formed, or did it take rather a long time for those chemical reactions to lead to the earliest types of life? And what is the evidence for early life on earth? What is the evidence for the origin of life on this planet and its emergence into early single-celled organisms that first occupied this planet many billions of years ago. Once we've established the presence of life on a planet, we want to know about its limits. How far can you push it, and what sort of extremes can it live in? This is important if we're to try and understand the possibilities of life on other planets, to assess their habitability, as we call it. And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists want to address are, what are the limits of life? What are the most extreme physical and chemical environments that life can survive and grow in? How does life survive extremes? What are the sorts of mechanisms that it evolves? What sort of biochemistry, what sort of physiology do organisms evolve in order to be able to cope with some of the most extreme environments on the earth? And are these limits universal? If we do find life on another planet out there in the universe, will it be living in completely conditions from life on Earth? Or will we in fact find similar life living in similar types of environments? And once we've looked at life in extremes, what does that tell us about the prospects for life elsewhere? About the possibilities that going to extreme environments on other planets and finding life there? So by studying life on our planet today, and looking at the way in which it lives in different types of environments and different extremes, we can learn something about the prospects for life elsewhere. 

Astrobiology as I've already mentioned is also concerned with trying to understand the history of life on earth once it did emerge, it's concerned with questions like, how is life related? When you walk around outside you see a whole diversity of life from dogs to giraffes to trees, how are all these different creatures related? And how die they come to be on the surface of the earth? And how did they evolve? Astrobiology is interested in trying to understand the connections between these different creatures and how they came to be and evolved from one another over time. We also want to know about multi cellular life, complex life. We'll see later in this course, that, when you look around you most the life you and I are familiar with, are things like dogs and giraffes that are multi-cellular creatures, complex large organisms that we can see with the naked eye. But in fact much of life on Earth is bacteria, archaea, simple single celled organisms. And we want to understand as astrobiologists how life emerged from those more simple organisms in the early history of life on Earth to the more complex life that you and I see on a day to day basis on the surface of the planet. 

And another question that concerns astrobiologists is catastrophes and extinctions. How does life go extinct? How do these catastrophes affect life throughout its history? Whether that be asteroid or comet impacts, giant volcanic eruptions and what sort of catastrophes might befall life along it's long tenure on life on Earth? 

Astrobiology is concerned with taking this information and looking for life elsewhere. And as I said earlier, there's no doubt that this is the most interesting question in astrobiology. At least the one that captures the public imagination. And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists ask once they've begun to get an understanding of life on the Earth is, is there life elsewhere in the Universe? Are we a unique experiment in biological evolution, or is it repeated on other planets? And if there is life elsewhere, what does it look like? What sort of life is it? Is it microbial life, single celled life, or is it intelligent life? And if there isn't any life out there in the universe, why not? What's missing in the rest of the universe that was present on the Earth, that allowed life to originate and evolve on this planet. 

Of course, following on from that question, another interest for astrobiologists but certainly for the general public is are there other intelligences in the universe. ? If there is life out there, could it be intelligent life? And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists want to address is, is intelligence inevitable? Wherever we get life on a planet, is it inevitable that it will eventually progress to intelligent types of lifeforms? Can we communicate with life on other planets? And if we do communicate with it, what would be the consequences for society? What would happen to us if we made contact with another intelligences? How would that affect religion and our social structures? And we'll answer of those questions In this course. 

Of course it's all very well looking for alien life and studying the evolution of life on the Earth and going out and hunting for life elsewhere, but of course we may eventually ourselves leave the Earth and travel beyond and establish permanent settlements on places like the Moon and Mars. And astrobiology is also concerned with the technical question of how human beings will establish themselves in space, what is the future of human life beyond the Earth? The sorts of questions that astrobiologists are concerned with span from science to technology to philosophy, and the sorts of questions are things like, Will humans leave the earth? Is it inevitable that we will move on beyond the Earth and establish a presence beyond our home planet? And if we do make this choice to leave the Earth, how will we do it? How will we establish self-sustaining settlements on other planets? And if we are going to spend money and human resources establishing other branches of civilization beyond the Earth and other planets, how do we do that but at the same time preserve the Earth? How do we look after our own planet, live sustainably on the Earth but establish sustainable settlements on other planets and planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mars. And how will we adapt to space? If we move out beyond the Earth what will be the social implications for humanity? How will we change as a species? How will our societies develop as we move out beyond the earth and establish settlements on other planetary bodies? 

Hopefully what you've learnt is that astrobiology covers many fields. It's a very diverse subject that goes from physics to chemistry, biology, and even philosophy and sociology when we think about the implications of discoveries in astrobiology. 

## 2.2: History of Astrobiology

People have been contemplating the possibility of habitable worlds, for a long time. This is a really rather remarkable statement by Metrodorus, an ancient Greek philosopher. Who was actually a student of Democritus, who first proposed the atomic theory of matter. And this is in loose translation of what he said. He said, it would be strange if a single ear of corn grew in a large plain, although only one habitable world in the infinite. Metrodorus was expressing the idea that if you go into a field it's very unusual to see one ear of corn growing in the middle of a field with no other corn around it. Generally if you go into a field and you see corn you'll see a lot of it. And he wondered if there is life on this planet, then surely there must be other worlds with life as well. Well, the ancient Greeks didn't quite have the same perception as the heavens that we do. They don't under, they didn't understand about planets, and they didn't understand the nature was of other stars. But nevertheless this was a remarkable statement for people thinking in early years astrobiology over 2,000 years ago about the possibility of inhabited worlds. As we go on through history we find other speculations that are just as remarkable. 

In the 16th century during the Renaissance this was a statement made by Giordano Bruno, who was an astronomer speculating about the possibility of planets beyond Earth. And it's worth reading what he said. He said in space there are countless constellations, suns, and planets, we only see the suns because they give light. The planets remain invisible for they are small and dark. There are also numberless Earth's circling around their suns. Now if you think about this statement today, in an age where we are beginning to detect Earth-like planets around other stars, this is a truly remarkable speculation for the 16th century. 

The invention of the telescope allowed us to go beyond these speculations, to see planets around other stars, and to start to form more empirical ideas about whether other planetary bodies could sustain life. And you might think that once the telescope had been invented there would be a lot less speculation, because now we'd have real data about other planetary bodies on which we could base ideas and speculations. But in fact, remarkably, completely the opposite happens now we have telescopes, we can see other planetary bodies. But we don't have enough information to know what their environments are like. So now we've got all these new planets on which we can speculate about the presence of other life. And the invention of the telescope of Galileo, and you can see here one of the first images that he looked at, which was the moons Jupiter, the four largest moons of Jupiter, now called the Galilean moons of Jupiter. This invention of the telescope and its widespread use led to the discovery of planets that caused speculation to run riot during the Enlightenment. This is a speculation by the famous scientist William Hershel, who wrote, whilst observing the moon, by reflecting a level on the subject I'm almost convinced that those numberless small Circuses we see on the moon are the works of the Lunarians and may be called their Towns. Herschel was observing asteroid craters on the moon, craters that seemed almost perfectly circular. So circular, they couldn't have possibly have been formed by natural processes. The must be the work of an intelligence, and he believed that the moon might be inhabited by Lunarians, who were constructing these fortifications on the moon. And even Christian Huygens, famous astronomer, observed spots on Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Spots that we now know are features of storms and, and deserts on the surface of Mars. And he concluded there were clouds and water and he stated, the taste of music with the inhabitants of Venus and Jupiter is at a high level, similar to that Frenchmen or Italians. 

Now these observations today seem crazy to us and they seem crazy particularly because they came from extremely erudite scientists that achieved remarkable things in their field. But it shows how with a very limited set of data people began speculating about life on other planets and I should say that these speculations are also a warning from the past. A warning about being too optimistic in astrobiology and we should be careful today in learning the lessons from our forebears about over speculation with very little data. Even in the 20th century, speculation runs riot. Percival Lowell the Astronomer who observed lines across the surface of Mars, an optical processing trick of the human brain which he interpreted to be canals, built by a dessicated dying civilization on Mars, trying to channel water from the polar icecaps to the equatorial regions of Mars. And he observed these canals over and over again. So convinced was he, he wrote this Every opposition is added to the assurance that canals are artificial, both by disclosing their peculiarities better and better and by removing generic doubts as to the planet's habitability. 

We now know, of course, there are no canals on Mars. Percival Lowell was deluded by his observations. But it shows that even in the 20th century people thought there might be intelligences on other planets in our solar system. Aliens still grip the human imagination. You only have to watch films produced by Hollywood and other production companies around the world. Aliens are pervasive throughout popular culture, from Star Wars to The Extraterrestrial, to the War of the Worlds, and on and on it goes, a long list of aliens that we've seen in films. 

So you can see how, optimism about astrobiology in particular intelligent life still grips the human imagination and __we have to be very careful to separate what our imagination wants us to believe and what the data, what the knowledge that we have from telescope and missions, is really telling us.__

In the 1950's and early 1960's, the space age began to unfold, and with it, the possibility of sending spacecraft to other planets. And we started to get views from spacecraft orbiting Mars and Venus. And these views were rather depressing. No evidence of civilizations, not even any evidence for simple life forms, even microbial life on these planets. And so the early years of the space age, were a period where people began to backtrack in their optimism about life beyond Earth. 

But ironically, as these spacecraft improved, and as our cameras improved, we began to see details. Details that suggested that we might not be quite as negative, as we thought we needed to be in the early years of the space age. People began to see valley networks on the surface of mars, outflow channels that suggests liquid water on the early surface of that planet and now, we know quite conclusively, that there was much more abundant liquid water on the surface on Mars early in its history. And as we saw earlier in this course, liquid water is necessary for life as we know it. So the presence of liquid water on the early history of Mars, in the early history of Mars suggests that this is a planet that may have been habitable for life. 

As the space age developed, so astrobiology has moved into perhaps a more optimistic stage of considering the possibility of life beyond Earth. What were the other developments that allowed astrobiology to make the transition from a philosophical and speculative science in ancient Greece and in the Renaissance. To an empirical science constrained by data. 

Urey and Miller experiment: Organic compounds + electricity = amino acids.

1970s: The Arecibo Dish in Puerto Rico sent out signals in Binary code the included a diagram of DNA, a map of the solar system, the numbers 1 to 10.

#### Possible Life?
-Mars had flowing water over 3B years ago.
- Enceladus, Saturn: There are geysers erupting from the south pole of this moon, throwing out water and other elements into sapce.
- Titan, Saturn: Rocks made of icy water. Rivers are made of liquid hydrocarbons.
- We have searched for Earth-like planets around other stars.

## 3 - 3 - 1.3 What is Life

#### What is Life?
- What are we actually looking for in the rocks?
- Huge implications for "when is a human alive".
- Life has complexity.
- Life has growth.
- Life replicates.
- Life metabolizes.
- Life seems to evolve by Darwinian evolution.
- Gerald Joyce: Life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution.

#### Non-life stuff also possess features of life.
-  Tornados have complex behavior but they are not alive.
-  Salt crystals can grow.
-  Computer programs can replicate and evolve.
-  Fire metabolizes and releases energy. Same reaction with our body (C + O -> energy).

#### Life stuff possess features of non-life.
- Viruses cannot replicate on their own.
- A single rabbit cannot replicate on its own. 
- There is no really physical or chemical characteristic about life that we can use to define what it is.

Natural kinds vs. non-natural kinds. Gold = natural because its properties are defined. Chair = non-natural because a chair is defined by people. When you sit on a table, it it a chair? When you eat on a chair, is it a table?

Life is the same. It defines part of chemistry that we like to think of as encapsulating our ideas of life. It's really just an empty human definition, but nevertheless, a definition that's important for astrobiology.

#### History
- Materialism (Empedoceles, Greece): Life has a soul, and this soul is made of atoms of fire.
- Vitalism: Life contains some vital force, and when you add this to something non-biological, it becomes biological. Spontaneous generation. Disproven..

## 3 - 4 - 1.4 Life on Earth - [13_19]

The majority of the biomass on earth is microscopic, bacteria.

Microbes are important bcause they are the most likely forms of life that we find on another planet. They can live in high temperature, high radiation, extreme acid, and so on. These extremes define the boundaries of life on our planet. They define the boundary of the biosphere. Temp, pH, dessication.

Biosphere is very thin. Inwards to the crust: Life cannot exist in environments hotter than 122C. Upper limit in the sky: Solar radiation. There are microorganisms in the clouds though. It's important to know the limits as a benchmakr so we can compare to other plantes.

## 3 - 5 - 1.5 Structure of Life_ Building Blocks - [9_42]

Life: CHeNOPS.

## 3 - 6 - 1.6 Structure of Life_ Cells - [14_22]

#### Three Major Features
- Membrane to enclose chemical reactions.
- Information storage system: Encoding instructions, transmitting info from 1 generation to another.
- System for gaining energy. Photosynthesis, heterotrophy (eating organic molecules), microorganisms that get their energy from FUCKING ROCKS. The process behind this is extracting energy from atoms and molecules to provide the enrgy for cell replication and cell growth.

# Week One (Module 2)

## 4 - 1 - 2.1 Origins of Life_ Building Blocks - [11_28]

#### How did the building blocks came to be?
- __Supernatural or divine intervention.__ This doesn't explain how the building blocks of life were created and how they were assembled. 
- __It originated elsewhere.__ The problem is that if life came from another planet, then that planet would be conducive for life, too. Hard to prove.
- __Life originated on the Earth.__ 

Amino acids are everywhere in the universe. We find them in meteorites that land on the surface of the Earth. It turns out that these meteorites also contain amino acids that are not used by biology. It seems that life has selected a subset of the available amino acids to be found in the extraterrestrial environment.

What does all this tell us? It tells us that the building blocks of life could have, could have been produced on the Earth endogenously in chemical reactions on the surface of the early Earth. And it also tells us that the building blocks of life could have arrived on the Earth in extraterrestrial materials in meteorites.

Where do nucleic acids come from? DNA is close to RNA and RNA can self-assemble into ribozymes, and these ribozymes can carry out chemical reactions, even including self-replication. 

How do you get memberanes? Experiments suggest that you can produce membranes very, very easily. Lipids from meteorites + water = Hydrophilic thingie.

And it remains one of the great challenges in astrobiology. To understand that transition from the chemical world to the biological world. So what have we learned in this lecture? 

## 4 - 2 - 2.2 Origins of Life_ Location - [11_53]

Where did these early reactions occur? 

#### Things needed for origin of life
- Energy source to do the chemical reactions.
- A means of concentrating molecules (without membranes).
- An environment that's conducive to these complex molecules and their assembly once they've been made.

#### Possible Locations?
- __Deep sea vents.__ Energy comes from hot fluids/crust.
- __Craters.__ There were more asteroid and comet impacts onto the early Earth than today. When they hit, they heat up rocks (source of energy), heat up water (environment), and the crater itself might be the pond of shit. Then the crater cools down yay.
- __Beaches.__ Tides cause water/stuff to concentrate.
- __Volcanic hot springs.__ Energy comes from crust, chemicals collect in the hot springs.
- __Bubbles.__ When a volcano erupts under the sea, gasses (H, CH4, CO) are enclosed in bubbles.
- __Outer space.__
- __Multiple?__

The most primitive microorganisms are the heat lovers. So ancient microbes that love heat might like that but not the next stages of life.

## 4 - 3 - 2.3 Origins of Life_ Alternative Chemistries - [11_04]

We assume that life is C-based. C has a lot of possible bond types, and its compounds are chemically stable.

Alternative is Si-based. But Si forms stable compounds with O. This is bad because it prevents Si from engaging with other chemical compounds. Maybe possible if a planet is Si-based and low O but Si has too great a propernsity to form reactions with O and form stable silicates for it to be useful in the origin of life. Si is also very reactive, more than we'd like.

Gasses are too inactive to be the basis of life. ), N, B, other types of atoms have a limited number of bonds. Mg, Ca, K, Na form ionic bonds.

Life also needs a solvent to carry out the rxns. On Earth that's liquid water. It dissolves many chemicals readily. It expands when freezes, so ice rises to the top, which can lead to frozen lakes. If ice is heavier than water than ponds would freeze through completely. Liquid H2O has a wide temp range, we can see them in the polar regions and in the hot springs. So we can make reactions there.

Ammonia? At low temps it readily dissolves many chemicals similar to aminos. Problem is low temp range: liquid from -78 to -34. It sinks when it freezes.

HF? Wide temp range (-83 to 20). But F is rare in the universe, 100K times less abundant than O to form compounds.

Some people have said that our idea of carbon-based life forms using liquid water is just a very narrow Earth-centered view of life and that on other planets, we would expect to find life with entirely novel biochemistries, almost unimaginable to us. But, in fact, when we go to other planets in our solar system, we don't observe unusual life forms. Are we prejudiced for C-based H2O-solvent life forms?

A future challenge in astrobiology is to really determine if we can make life based of different chemicals, not just C and H2O.

## 5 - 1 - 3.1 Formation of the Solar System - The Early Earth

The solar system formed like all star systems in the universe, in a molecular cloud. A molecular cloud is a region of the universe where hydrogen, helium and some other elements reach densities that are high enough for structure to begin to form. And for the clouds to begin to collapse under their own weight. 

As the clouds begin to collapse under their own gravitational influence, some of this material forms a protostar, which is a region of much higher density at the center of a nebula swirling around this star. Structures begin to form in these nebula. And the new solar winds being generated by this early star is pushing the material out and forming these outflows around the nebula. So structure begins to form in the molecular cloud as well as the star at the center. 

The most crucial event in the formation of a star system in the ignition of the nuclear furnace inside the center of that protostar in middle of the nebula. And this occurs by a process called nuclear fusion. This is an example of a reaction of nuclear fusion where deuterium is fusing with tritium and forming helium and also a neutron. And in that process, much energy is released. The nuclear furnace is ignited, and the star produces light and energy. And it's this light and energy that will be responsible for driving the rest of the processes that are occurring in this nebula as planets begin to form. Beyond the star in the nebula, material begins to coalesce and form planets. 

Beyond the line called ice line volatile like water, hydrogen, helium begin to coalesce and become giant gas planets such as Jupiter, and Saturn in our own solar system. In the inner regions of that nebular, smaller pieces of rock begin to coalesce. These planetesimals come together and eventually form small rocky planets like Venus, Earth, and Mars. So there's a very distinctive separation in the types of planets that can be formed in nebulae. 

Now of course it's worth saying that things are not quite this simple. Planets can also migrate. It's thought, for instance, that Uranus and Neptune have migrated in their past. And the solar system will also pick up rocky debris in the outer regions of the nebula. But in the inside of the solar system, in the inner regions of that solar system, the terrestrial rocky type planets will form like the Earth. And once Earth had formed, the stage was then set for conditions to become better and more appropriate for life.

## 5 - 2 - 3.2 Conditions on the early Earth - [7_04]

Once the earth had formed in the early nebula, the stage was then set for the emergence of life. But what were the conditions like, on the early earth, and how do we know what those conditions were like? Well, the earth formed 4.56 billion years ago, but some of the earliest rocks that we have on the earth are between about 4 billion years to the 3.8 billion years old. So the problem we have, that there is about 11% of the Earth's history that is missing in the geological record, and that record that we do have, is very sparse. 

But nevertheless, those ancient rocks that we have do tell us something about conditions on the early Earth and what those conditions might have been like, for early life as it emerged. Some of the oldest rocks are from the Isua region, of western Greenland. And these are rocks that were made up of ancient sediments on early earth, about 3.8 billion years ago. And they've subsequently been pressurized and heated, over the many billions of years, in which those rocks have been subducted into the crust of the earth and then re-exposed. So they're very altered. But, nevertheless, we can tell something about those rocks, and what the conditions might have been like, on early earth. And if we look at those Isua rocks, we find evidence of a number of different types of rocks that might have existed in those original ancient sediments. 

First of all, we find evidence of limestones. And limestones are essentially carbonates laid down today in modern marine environments, for example, in shallow environments around the edges of the coast. Limestones tend to suggest the presence of liquid water. 

We also find metamorphosed sandstones. Sand stones are essentially coarse, sand if you'd like, that's conglomerated together, and formed a rock. It's become lithified, it's formed a rock. And, suggests as well presence of water in environments. Sand stones are sedimentary rocks, sediments that are laid down in environments where there is water. For example, in shallow rivers or shallow marine environments. 

And there's also some evidence in these ancient rocks of pillow larvaes. Pillow lavas are formed when basalt, which is volcanic rock, is erupted in a volcanic eruption, and comes into contact with water. For example, at the bottom of the oceans. And as soon as that lava comes into contact with water, it's instantly quenched and solidifies. Forming these shapes that look a bit like pillows. Hence its name, pillow lava. 

So pillow lava, lime stones and sand stones, remnants of these sorts of rocks and the isua in rocks, suggest that there was liquid water on the early Earth, at least by 3.8 billion years ago, and probably before. There's other evidence as well. 

But, the point about this, evidence is it shows that the early Earth might have been quite similar to the present day Earth, in the sense that there were bodies of liquid water available for life to emerge in possibly oceans. When we look at all the evidence of, early rocks and the rock record. It tells us several things about the earth 3.8 billion years ago. It tells us that the earth had bodies of, of water, much like the present day earth. 

It also tells us that there was exposed land that was being weathered, and producing sediments that may have been responsible for some of these rocks like sand stones. Sandstones are composed of quartz. Suggesting there were continental areas that were being weathered and producing that quartz. It was then washing out into the oceans, and forming part of those now ancient rocks that we, we find in Greenland. These sorts of processes if they were occurring then, suggest that the Earth at this time had similar geological processes that we're familiar with today. For example, plate tectonics. Plates being subducted, and then reformed and rewrought. And these sedimentary rocks being formed in the hydrological process. It was occurring on early Earth. 

And this suggests that the Earth also had internal layering. A differentiation of the different parts of the earth from the core, through the mantle, through to the crust. It suggests that the structure of the earth is much like present day earth. So, at least in terms of the presence of liquid water, the presence of land masses, the earth might have been somewhat similar to present day earth about 3.8 billion years ago. The sort of environment that we think might have been condusive to life. 

What about the other characteristics of the planet that are important for biology? Well, we can learn something about the early atmosphere, and we'll talk about Oxygen in the atmosphere later on in this course. But the rock record tells us that if there was liquid water there, the temperature must have been within the range that's suitable for life. If there was liquid water, then the temperature must have been between freezing and maybe a few tens of degrees, to allow that liquid water to persist on the surface of the planet. That suggests that the temperature conditions were suitable for life. 

We know from the rock record that the early atmosphere only had trace quantities of oxygen. Today those, concentrations of oxygen at 21%. In the early history of the Earth, the oxygen concentrations would've been much less than .1%. And so the atmosphere was very different from today. Carbon dioxide would've been much more abundant. And there would have been more Methane as well. Some of that Methane, perhaps, being produced by biology. But, both Carbon Dioxide and Methane are greenhouse gases, and they would have contributed to warming the surface of the Earth at that time. 

Why is this important? Well, we know that the sun was less luminous than it is today. The early sun was perhaps about 25% less luminous than it is today. Which means that it would have been imparting less heat to the Earth during that time. And one question that's been raised is, if the sun was less luminous than today, why didn't the Earth just freeze over? Why wasn't the Earth too cold for life and liquid water 3.8 billion years ago? And one answer to that paradox, that's being called the faint young sun paradox, is that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and methane, 2 greenhouse gases, would have warmed up the surface of the Earth and provided conditions that would have been clement for liquid water. And that warming effect would have compensated for the cooler young sun, in that early history of the Earth. 

And so the presence of these gases may have been very important, not just for warming the earth and keeping it much, warmer than today. And, and providing the liquid water environments that early life would have required. But they might have also been important for life itself. Carbon dioxide would have provided a source of carbon for early lifeforms in the oceans and on the earl, early land masses. So we know that the atmosphere was very different than today. 

This also has consequences for one other physical factor that's very important for life, ultraviolet radiation. There was no ozone shield before. Microbes probably would have meant that they would have had to have shielded themselves. Perhaps by living inside rocks, or living beneath layers of microbes that would have protected them from the ultraviolet radiation. Microbial mats, those top layers of microbes would have acted as sacrificial layers, to protect the microbes underneath from the intense ultraviolet radiation. So this could've been one factor that was very different on the early earth. 

Some people have speculated that the high concentrations of methane in the atmosphere of the early earth might have reacted with sunlight and formed a hydrocarbon smog. And that smog of complex organic carbons, could have streamed out ultraviolet radiation. So there may have been other ways on early earth in which that intense ultraviolet radiation was screened out. But in the worst case scenario, the UV radiation would have been 1000 times higher than today. This would have been a challenge, for early life. 

Another challenge that was very prevalent on early Earth was higher, numbers of asteroid and comet impacts on the surface of the early Earth. We know that there was a large number of impacts between about 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago. A much higher rate of impact than on the surface of present day Earth. Perhaps many orders of magnitudes, many tens of times higher than the present day Earth. How do we know that? Well we know that by looking at the moon. The moon preserves a record of impacts from the early solar system. And the large number of craters that you can see on the moon, that you can see with your own eye, by looking up at the moon in the night sky, you can see those craters. They are the evidence of intense bombardment in the early history of our solar system. And we call this period, the late heavy bombardment. It would have been a period that was very challenging for life. Because those impacts would have heated up habitats. Probably made some places too hot for life to have been able to tolerate the physical conditions caused by asteroid and comet impacts. So the emergence of life had to, occur in this very challenging environment of, heavy asteroid and comet impacts. 

So, what we see in this picture, is an early Earth that's somewhat similar to the present day Earth. Bodies of liquid water, oceans, probably early continental land masses. But things were very different as well. A very different atmospheric composition. Much more challenging environment with higher levels of asteroid and comet impacts. And also high level of volcanism. Volcanic activity would have been much greater on the early Earth. But this was the setting, in which the first life forms emerged on our planet. 

So what have we learnt? We've learnt that the geological record gives us our main clues about the conditions of early Earth. We've learned that over 10% of that record is missing. But nevertheless, there are ancient rocks about 3.8 billion years old, some slightly older. That give us clues as to what the early conditions were like. We've learned that the Earth has some features that are strangely familiar to us. There would have been oceans. Areas of continental land masses as well, much like present day Earth. We've also learned that things are very different as well, the atmosphere was very different. Low concentrations of oxygen, higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, and methane, which might have been important for climate at that time. We've learned that the conditions for life would have been quite challenging. For example, higher levels of ultraviolet radiation may have existed on the early Earth. And also, much higher levels of asteroid and comet bombardment that would have provided a challenge for early life trying to emerge in these early habitats. But nevertheless, these environments were now clement enough for the origin and emergence of life.

## 5 - 3 - 3.3 Evidence of early life - [6_55]

We've seen that the conditions on the early Earth became clement for life rather early on. But what is the evidencee for early life on Earth? The only direct evidence we have is from fossils and chemical signatures preserved in the geological record, and this evidence may be proof that life was established on the Earth by 3.5 billion years ago, possibly as early as 3.8 billion years ago. It's thought that the evidence does suggest life by 3.8 billion years, then it's likely to have arisen some time before that, because that early evidence is probably not preserved in the fossil record. This would suggest that life was present soon after the formation of the crust and oceans. And at the end of that period of late heavy bombardment, that period of intense asteroid and comet impacts on the surface of early Earth. 

Now, before we look at some of that evidence, it's worth reminding ourselves that the evidence is subject to intense scientific controversy. And to base, in fact, the evidence for early life on Earth is one of the most hotly debated areas of astrobiology. There are several lines of evidence that have been developed to suggest the presence of life on early Earth. 

One line of evidence of early life on Earth, is features called stromatolites. Stromatolites is laminated mounds which formed today in shallow marine water. They're built up by successive accumulation of sediments and microbes, and also rocks such as calcium carbonate. So as the microbes form, sediments collect on top of them and new layers of microbes form, and eventually you end up with these macroscopically visible mounds of microbial activity. 

The oldest Stromatolites have been found in 3.46 billion year old apex church silica rocks in Western Australia's Warraweena group. One of the reasons why they're so subject to controversy is because these mounds, as you can understand, look like features that can form by non-biological processes. For example, if sediments are laid down in shallow marine environments or rivers for example, they can also form these wavy textures that look at least, on the large scale, a little bit like stromatolites. 

So, further lines of evidence have been the search for microfossils. Fossils of individual microorganisms in these stromatolites or other types of rocks that can be evidence for life. This 3.46 billion year old stromatholites in Western Australia contain these filamentous structures which are thought to resemble modern cynobacteria. That composed of kerogen, which is the alteration product of heated and pressurized organic matter. And you can see some examples here of proported filaments in these apex charts. These micro fossils have also been subject to intense debate. Particularly because non-biological processes can also form filamentous structures. We don't really know the context of these ancient rocks, so this is another line of evidence, though, that astrobiologists seek in order to demonstrate early life on Earth, fossils of individual microorganisms. 

Carbon dating.But similar sorts of organisms taking out carbon through photosynthesis, depositing that carbon either in minerals or in organic matter, can also be used to find chemical signatures on early Earth. This so called isotope fractionation, this preferential uptake of light, lighter isotopes compared to heavier isotopes by life, is seen in carbonate rocks from as far back as 3.5 billion years ago and slightly more controversially earlier as well. 

So what is the problem with all of this evidence? These three lines of evidence, macroscopic features such as stromatolites, microfossils of individual microorganisms, and indirect evidence such as chemical signatures. Well, first of all, these are rocks very heavily metamorphosed. In other words, they've been altered by heat and pressure since their formation those many billions of years ago. This makes it much more difficult to interpret the evidence. The geological settings are usually uncertain while heavily disputed. We don't know exactly what the conditions were like in the regions where those early rocks were formed, and so were they really conducive for life? 

That's very important to determine to find out whether the fossils or chemical signatures that we see are really plausible evidence for life. And many of the features that we observed can be produced by nonbiological processes. The wavy textures in stromatolites can be produced in sediments without biology. Microfossils can be formed with similar types of structures by non biological processes. Filamenters, non biological structures that just look like biology. Chemical signatures, isotopic fractionation can also be caused by non biological processes. But scientist think that when this evidence is taken together, it does provide some compelling evidence for life on the early earth.

So what have we learned? We've learned that it's thought that life is established on the Earth by at least 3.5 billion years ago. The main evidence of this life comes from macroscopic features such as stromatolites, microfossils of creatures, and independent chemical alterations, such as the fractionation of carbon isotopes. Many people dispute this evidence on the grounds that similar features could be a result of non-biological processes. But it does show that the search for life on early Earth and the evidence for life on early Earth is an ongoing challenge of astrobiology. And this work will reveal whether the early life on Earth was established 3.5 billion years ago or earlier, and what the nature of this life might have been.

## 5 - 4 - 3.4 The Tree of Life - [9_12]

The Tree of Life is essentially a depiction of the relationship between organisms that evolutionary relationships and how they branch from one another. This is an example of the Tree of Life, and you can see it's made up of many groups of organisms. In fact, three groups or domains of organisms. On the left, you can see bacteria such as cyanobacteria, these are photosynthetic cyanobacteria that produce oxygen, and on the far right hand side, part of that Tree of Life includes animals, which includes, of course, ourselves, as well as, fungi and plants. How do we create this tree, and how do astrobiologists know the relationship between these different organisms? Well, Phylogenetics is the field of study that seeks to understand the evolutionary relationship between groups of organisms. It's based on comparisons of molecules within those organisms, such as the genetic storage information DNA or differences between their shapes. 

Here's a more detailed Tree of Life, and you can see that it starts with a common branch, and this is the common ancestor. The common ancestor of life that gave rise to all life on Earth today. And it's the job of astrobiologists to try and find out what that common ancestor was. 

The common ancestor gave rise to three main domains of life. These three domains are bacteria, which include many of the bacteria living in your soil, in your garden, also bacteria that cause disease. And then another domain called archaea. Archaea are made up of some of the organisms that live in the most extreme environments on the Earth, such as microbes that live in hot springs in the deep oceans or in volcanic springs, in volcanic areas. And then on the right of that diagram, you can see the eukaryotes, eukaryota. Eukaryotes include all multi-cellular life, such as animals, plants, some fungi, but also some single-celled organisms, as well including algae that live in the oceans. 

So how do we build this phylogenetic tree, this Tree of Life? Taxonomy, molecules inside organisms. Ribosomal RNA: responsible for translating DNA into proteins for reading the DNA code and turning it into proteins and in fact reads the code on RNA, RiboNucleicAcid and because this Ribosomal RNA so crucial to cell function, it hasn't changed much over billions of years. 

Organisms with similar rRNA have not changed much. rRna from two organisms that diverged would have a bigger split in RNA. Plate count anomaly: We don't know how to grow these microbes from the natural environment.

Microbes can do remarkable things. If I told you, for instance, that you could walk up to a person in the street, and just by touching them, your eye color would become the same as their eye color, you would think that's a ridiculous idea. Some sort of weird science fiction idea. But in fact, bacteria can do exactly that. In the environment they can take up DNA from other bacteria, and they can change their characteristics by absorbing this DNA. One process by which they do this, is called conjugation. Whereby they directly transfer DNA from one bacterium to another. This process makes the Tree of Life a little bit more complicated, because genetic information is not just transferred vertically from one generation to another through time, but the material can also be transferred horizontally, as we say, between species, at any particular point in time. And this means that the Tree of Life is less like a Tree of Life and more like a web of life, or a ring of life.
