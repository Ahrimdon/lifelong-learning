# Week One (Module 1)

## 1.1: Introduction

Astrobiology forces us to address philosophical questions that strike at the very core of our civilization. If the answer to this question is, no, we are not alone in the universe, we're also faced with some very fascinating questions. What is the nature of this other life on other planets? Is it microbial life? Life like bacteria? And, if so, how does it compare to life on Earth and where is it? Or is it intelligent life? And if it is intelligent life, what is the nature of this other intelligence? Can we communicate with it? And what will be the consequences if we do communicate with it? Are we alone in in the Universe is unquestionably the one question in astrobiology that fires the imagination of the general public. And it's probably the question that brought you a long to this course. It's a very reasonable question to ask. When you think about the Universe that we live in. 

The planet on which we live orbits a single star and this star is one of about 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. And our own galaxy is probably one of many, many billions of galaxies throughout the Universe. In truth we don't know how many galaxies there are in the Universe, it may be something on the order of 100 billion galaxies maybe more, but if you think about it 200 billion stars in our own galaxy, possibly 100 billion galaxies throughout the universe, it seems reasonable to ask the question is there life on other planets? And that is why astrobiology is concerned with a question for yet which we do not have an answer, but which scientifically, empirically looks like a reasonable question to ask. 

To search for life on other planets, we first of all have to understand something about life on our own home planet, Earth. This is a rather beautiful image taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts on the surface of the moon. And it shows the Earth hovering above the horizon of the moon. It's sometimes called the Blue Marble image. Because it shows a picture of the Earth as a tranquil planet, it looks like a very peaceful place. For this belies the history of life on Earth and the future of life on this planet. For example, we know that planet Earth has been struck by large pieces of rock in its past. Astroid and comet impacts that have done devastating things to life on the surface of the earth. We think, for example, that the dinosaurs were made extinct by such an asteroid impact 65 million years ago. Now, whether an asteroid really did kill the dinosaurs, is something that is controversial in some parts of the scientific community. But whatever one's views about this, the fact that scientists proposed that the extinction of the dinosaurs was caused by an asteroid, shows that in order to understand the past history of life on Earth, we have to understand its connection with the cosmic environment. What sort of rocks might come from outer space and threaten life on the Earth? 

In a few billion years from now, our Sun will come to the end of its life. And, at that point, our own planet will be completely destroyed and all life on it will be extinguished. That's not for a long time to come. But we do know that, in order to understand the future of life on a planet, its long term future, we must think about the connection of a planet, again, with its cosmic environment, how it connects with the history of its parent star and how long that star lives, and therefore, how long you can expect life to survive on a planet. So in order to understand life on Earth, we have to understand the past history of life and its connection with the cosmic environment. And we have to understand the future of life on earth and its connection with the cosmic environment. In other words, an understanding of life on earth is really about studying astrobiology, the connection of life with its astronomical or cosmic environment. 

Astrobiology is first interested with understanding the origin of life on this planet, how did it come about? And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists ask and that we'll be looking at in this course, are how did life originate on this planet? Where did life originate? What where the locations of the first organisms to emerge on this planet; where might they have first evolved? Is life an inevitable process on any planet where the conditions are good enough? Do you always get an evolution of life? Is this a common process throughout the Universe? When did this happen? Did it happen very quickly after the Earth was formed, or did it take rather a long time for those chemical reactions to lead to the earliest types of life? And what is the evidence for early life on earth? What is the evidence for the origin of life on this planet and its emergence into early single-celled organisms that first occupied this planet many billions of years ago. Once we've established the presence of life on a planet, we want to know about its limits. How far can you push it, and what sort of extremes can it live in? This is important if we're to try and understand the possibilities of life on other planets, to assess their habitability, as we call it. And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists want to address are, what are the limits of life? What are the most extreme physical and chemical environments that life can survive and grow in? How does life survive extremes? What are the sorts of mechanisms that it evolves? What sort of biochemistry, what sort of physiology do organisms evolve in order to be able to cope with some of the most extreme environments on the earth? And are these limits universal? If we do find life on another planet out there in the universe, will it be living in completely conditions from life on Earth? Or will we in fact find similar life living in similar types of environments? And once we've looked at life in extremes, what does that tell us about the prospects for life elsewhere? About the possibilities that going to extreme environments on other planets and finding life there? So by studying life on our planet today, and looking at the way in which it lives in different types of environments and different extremes, we can learn something about the prospects for life elsewhere. 

Astrobiology as I've already mentioned is also concerned with trying to understand the history of life on earth once it did emerge, it's concerned with questions like, how is life related? When you walk around outside you see a whole diversity of life from dogs to giraffes to trees, how are all these different creatures related? And how die they come to be on the surface of the earth? And how did they evolve? Astrobiology is interested in trying to understand the connections between these different creatures and how they came to be and evolved from one another over time. We also want to know about multi cellular life, complex life. We'll see later in this course, that, when you look around you most the life you and I are familiar with, are things like dogs and giraffes that are multi-cellular creatures, complex large organisms that we can see with the naked eye. But in fact much of life on Earth is bacteria, archaea, simple single celled organisms. And we want to understand as astrobiologists how life emerged from those more simple organisms in the early history of life on Earth to the more complex life that you and I see on a day to day basis on the surface of the planet. 

And another question that concerns astrobiologists is catastrophes and extinctions. How does life go extinct? How do these catastrophes affect life throughout its history? Whether that be asteroid or comet impacts, giant volcanic eruptions and what sort of catastrophes might befall life along it's long tenure on life on Earth? 

Astrobiology is concerned with taking this information and looking for life elsewhere. And as I said earlier, there's no doubt that this is the most interesting question in astrobiology. At least the one that captures the public imagination. And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists ask once they've begun to get an understanding of life on the Earth is, is there life elsewhere in the Universe? Are we a unique experiment in biological evolution, or is it repeated on other planets? And if there is life elsewhere, what does it look like? What sort of life is it? Is it microbial life, single celled life, or is it intelligent life? And if there isn't any life out there in the universe, why not? What's missing in the rest of the universe that was present on the Earth, that allowed life to originate and evolve on this planet. 

Of course, following on from that question, another interest for astrobiologists but certainly for the general public is are there other intelligences in the universe. ? If there is life out there, could it be intelligent life? And the sorts of questions that astrobiologists want to address is, is intelligence inevitable? Wherever we get life on a planet, is it inevitable that it will eventually progress to intelligent types of lifeforms? Can we communicate with life on other planets? And if we do communicate with it, what would be the consequences for society? What would happen to us if we made contact with another intelligences? How would that affect religion and our social structures? And we'll answer of those questions In this course. 

Of course it's all very well looking for alien life and studying the evolution of life on the Earth and going out and hunting for life elsewhere, but of course we may eventually ourselves leave the Earth and travel beyond and establish permanent settlements on places like the Moon and Mars. And astrobiology is also concerned with the technical question of how human beings will establish themselves in space, what is the future of human life beyond the Earth? The sorts of questions that astrobiologists are concerned with span from science to technology to philosophy, and the sorts of questions are things like, Will humans leave the earth? Is it inevitable that we will move on beyond the Earth and establish a presence beyond our home planet? And if we do make this choice to leave the Earth, how will we do it? How will we establish self-sustaining settlements on other planets? And if we are going to spend money and human resources establishing other branches of civilization beyond the Earth and other planets, how do we do that but at the same time preserve the Earth? How do we look after our own planet, live sustainably on the Earth but establish sustainable settlements on other planets and planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mars. And how will we adapt to space? If we move out beyond the Earth what will be the social implications for humanity? How will we change as a species? How will our societies develop as we move out beyond the earth and establish settlements on other planetary bodies? 

Hopefully what you've learnt is that astrobiology covers many fields. It's a very diverse subject that goes from physics to chemistry, biology, and even philosophy and sociology when we think about the implications of discoveries in astrobiology. 

## 2.2: History of Astrobiology

People have been contemplating the possibility of habitable worlds, for a long time. This is a really rather remarkable statement by Metrodorus, an ancient Greek philosopher. Who was actually a student of Democritus, who first proposed the atomic theory of matter. And this is in loose translation of what he said. He said, it would be strange if a single ear of corn grew in a large plain, although only one habitable world in the infinite. Metrodorus was expressing the idea that if you go into a field it's very unusual to see one ear of corn growing in the middle of a field with no other corn around it. Generally if you go into a field and you see corn you'll see a lot of it. And he wondered if there is life on this planet, then surely there must be other worlds with life as well. Well, the ancient Greeks didn't quite have the same perception as the heavens that we do. They don't under, they didn't understand about planets, and they didn't understand the nature was of other stars. But nevertheless this was a remarkable statement for people thinking in early years astrobiology over 2,000 years ago about the possibility of inhabited worlds. As we go on through history we find other speculations that are just as remarkable. 

In the 16th century during the Renaissance this was a statement made by Giordano Bruno, who was an astronomer speculating about the possibility of planets beyond Earth. And it's worth reading what he said. He said in space there are countless constellations, suns, and planets, we only see the suns because they give light. The planets remain invisible for they are small and dark. There are also numberless Earth's circling around their suns. Now if you think about this statement today, in an age where we are beginning to detect Earth-like planets around other stars, this is a truly remarkable speculation for the 16th century. 

The invention of the telescope allowed us to go beyond these speculations, to see planets around other stars, and to start to form more empirical ideas about whether other planetary bodies could sustain life. And you might think that once the telescope had been invented there would be a lot less speculation, because now we'd have real data about other planetary bodies on which we could base ideas and speculations. But in fact, remarkably, completely the opposite happens now we have telescopes, we can see other planetary bodies. But we don't have enough information to know what their environments are like. So now we've got all these new planets on which we can speculate about the presence of other life. And the invention of the telescope of Galileo, and you can see here one of the first images that he looked at, which was the moons Jupiter, the four largest moons of Jupiter, now called the Galilean moons of Jupiter. This invention of the telescope and its widespread use led to the discovery of planets that caused speculation to run riot during the Enlightenment. This is a speculation by the famous scientist William Hershel, who wrote, whilst observing the moon, by reflecting a level on the subject I'm almost convinced that those numberless small Circuses we see on the moon are the works of the Lunarians and may be called their Towns. Herschel was observing asteroid craters on the moon, craters that seemed almost perfectly circular. So circular, they couldn't have possibly have been formed by natural processes. The must be the work of an intelligence, and he believed that the moon might be inhabited by Lunarians, who were constructing these fortifications on the moon. And even Christian Huygens, famous astronomer, observed spots on Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Spots that we now know are features of storms and, and deserts on the surface of Mars. And he concluded there were clouds and water and he stated, the taste of music with the inhabitants of Venus and Jupiter is at a high level, similar to that Frenchmen or Italians. 

Now these observations today seem crazy to us and they seem crazy particularly because they came from extremely erudite scientists that achieved remarkable things in their field. But it shows how with a very limited set of data people began speculating about life on other planets and I should say that these speculations are also a warning from the past. A warning about being too optimistic in astrobiology and we should be careful today in learning the lessons from our forebears about over speculation with very little data. Even in the 20th century, speculation runs riot. Percival Lowell the Astronomer who observed lines across the surface of Mars, an optical processing trick of the human brain which he interpreted to be canals, built by a dessicated dying civilization on Mars, trying to channel water from the polar icecaps to the equatorial regions of Mars. And he observed these canals over and over again. So convinced was he, he wrote this Every opposition is added to the assurance that canals are artificial, both by disclosing their peculiarities better and better and by removing generic doubts as to the planet's habitability. 

We now know, of course, there are no canals on Mars. Percival Lowell was deluded by his observations. But it shows that even in the 20th century people thought there might be intelligences on other planets in our solar system. Aliens still grip the human imagination. You only have to watch films produced by Hollywood and other production companies around the world. Aliens are pervasive throughout popular culture, from Star Wars to The Extraterrestrial, to the War of the Worlds, and on and on it goes, a long list of aliens that we've seen in films. 

So you can see how, optimism about astrobiology in particular intelligent life still grips the human imagination and __we have to be very careful to separate what our imagination wants us to believe and what the data, what the knowledge that we have from telescope and missions, is really telling us.__

In the 1950's and early 1960's, the space age began to unfold, and with it, the possibility of sending spacecraft to other planets. And we started to get views from spacecraft orbiting Mars and Venus. And these views were rather depressing. No evidence of civilizations, not even any evidence for simple life forms, even microbial life on these planets. And so the early years of the space age, were a period where people began to backtrack in their optimism about life beyond Earth. 

But ironically, as these spacecraft improved, and as our cameras improved, we began to see details. Details that suggested that we might not be quite as negative, as we thought we needed to be in the early years of the space age. People began to see valley networks on the surface of mars, outflow channels that suggests liquid water on the early surface of that planet and now, we know quite conclusively, that there was much more abundant liquid water on the surface on Mars early in its history. And as we saw earlier in this course, liquid water is necessary for life as we know it. So the presence of liquid water on the early history of Mars, in the early history of Mars suggests that this is a planet that may have been habitable for life. 

As the space age developed, so astrobiology has moved into perhaps a more optimistic stage of considering the possibility of life beyond Earth. What were the other developments that allowed astrobiology to make the transition from a philosophical and speculative science in ancient Greece and in the Renaissance. To an empirical science constrained by data. 

Urey and Miller experiment: Organic compounds + electricity = amino acids.

1970s: The Arecibo Dish in Puerto Rico sent out signals in Binary code the included a diagram of DNA, a map of the solar system, the numbers 1 to 10.

#### Possible Life?
-Mars had flowing water over 3B years ago.
- Enceladus, Saturn: There are geysers erupting from the south pole of this moon, throwing out water and other elements into sapce.
- Titan, Saturn: Rocks made of icy water. Rivers are made of liquid hydrocarbons.
- We have searched for Earth-like planets around other stars.

## 3 - 3 - 1.3 What is Life

#### What is Life?
- What are we actually looking for in the rocks?
- Huge implications for "when is a human alive".
- Life has complexity.
- Life has growth.
- Life replicates.
- Life metabolizes.
- Life seems to evolve by Darwinian evolution.
- Gerald Joyce: Life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution.

#### Non-life stuff also possess features of life.
-  Tornados have complex behavior but they are not alive.
-  Salt crystals can grow.
-  Computer programs can replicate and evolve.
-  Fire metabolizes and releases energy. Same reaction with our body (C + O -> energy).

#### Life stuff possess features of non-life.
- Viruses cannot replicate on their own.
- A single rabbit cannot replicate on its own. 
- There is no really physical or chemical characteristic about life that we can use to define what it is.

Natural kinds vs. non-natural kinds. Gold = natural because its properties are defined. Chair = non-natural because a chair is defined by people. When you sit on a table, it it a chair? When you eat on a chair, is it a table?

Life is the same. It defines part of chemistry that we like to think of as encapsulating our ideas of life. It's really just an empty human definition, but nevertheless, a definition that's important for astrobiology.

#### History
- Materialism (Empedoceles, Greece): Life has a soul, and this soul is made of atoms of fire.
- Vitalism: Life contains some vital force, and when you add this to something non-biological, it becomes biological. Spontaneous generation. Disproven..

## 3 - 4 - 1.4 Life on Earth - [13_19]

The majority of the biomass on earth is microscopic, bacteria.

Microbes are important bcause they are the most likely forms of life that we find on another planet. They can live in high temperature, high radiation, extreme acid, and so on. These extremes define the boundaries of life on our planet. They define the boundary of the biosphere. Temp, pH, dessication.

Biosphere is very thin. Inwards to the crust: Life cannot exist in environments hotter than 122C. Upper limit in the sky: Solar radiation. There are microorganisms in the clouds though. It's important to know the limits as a benchmakr so we can compare to other plantes.

## 3 - 5 - 1.5 Structure of Life_ Building Blocks - [9_42]

Life: CHeNOPS.

## 3 - 6 - 1.6 Structure of Life_ Cells - [14_22]

#### Three Major Features
- Membrane to enclose chemical reactions.
- Information storage system: Encoding instructions, transmitting info from 1 generation to another.
- System for gaining energy. Photosynthesis, heterotrophy (eating organic molecules), microorganisms that get their energy from FUCKING ROCKS. The process behind this is extracting energy from atoms and molecules to provide the enrgy for cell replication and cell growth.

# Week One (Module 2)

## 4 - 1 - 2.1 Origins of Life_ Building Blocks - [11_28]

#### How did the building blocks came to be?
- __Supernatural or divine intervention.__ This doesn't explain how the building blocks of life were created and how they were assembled. 
- __It originated elsewhere.__ The problem is that if life came from another planet, then that planet would be conducive for life, too. Hard to prove.
- __Life originated on the Earth.__ 

Amino acids are everywhere in the universe. We find them in meteorites that land on the surface of the Earth. It turns out that these meteorites also contain amino acids that are not used by biology. It seems that life has selected a subset of the available amino acids to be found in the extraterrestrial environment.

What does all this tell us? It tells us that the building blocks of life could have, could have been produced on the Earth endogenously in chemical reactions on the surface of the early Earth. And it also tells us that the building blocks of life could have arrived on the Earth in extraterrestrial materials in meteorites.

Where do nucleic acids come from? DNA is close to RNA and RNA can self-assemble into ribozymes, and these ribozymes can carry out chemical reactions, even including self-replication. 

How do you get memberanes? Experiments suggest that you can produce membranes very, very easily. Lipids from meteorites + water = Hydrophilic thingie.

And it remains one of the great challenges in astrobiology. To understand that transition from the chemical world to the biological world. So what have we learned in this lecture? 

## 4 - 2 - 2.2 Origins of Life_ Location - [11_53]

Where did these early reactions occur? 

#### Things needed for origin of life
- Energy source to do the chemical reactions.
- A means of concentrating molecules (without membranes).
- An environment that's conducive to these complex molecules and their assembly once they've been made.

#### Possible Locations?
- __Deep sea vents.__ Energy comes from hot fluids/crust.
- __Craters.__ There were more asteroid and comet impacts onto the early Earth than today. When they hit, they heat up rocks (source of energy), heat up water (environment), and the crater itself might be the pond of shit. Then the crater cools down yay.
- __Beaches.__ Tides cause water/stuff to concentrate.
- __Volcanic hot springs.__ Energy comes from crust, chemicals collect in the hot springs.
- __Bubbles.__ When a volcano erupts under the sea, gasses (H, CH4, CO) are enclosed in bubbles.
- __Outer space.__
- __Multiple?__

The most primitive microorganisms are the heat lovers. So ancient microbes that love heat might like that but not the next stages of life.

## 4 - 3 - 2.3 Origins of Life_ Alternative Chemistries - [11_04]

We assume that life is C-based. C has a lot of possible bond types, and its compounds are chemically stable.

Alternative is Si-based. But Si forms stable compounds with O. This is bad because it prevents Si from engaging with other chemical compounds. Maybe possible if a planet is Si-based and low O but Si has too great a propernsity to form reactions with O and form stable silicates for it to be useful in the origin of life. Si is also very reactive, more than we'd like.

Gasses are too inactive to be the basis of life. ), N, B, other types of atoms have a limited number of bonds. Mg, Ca, K, Na form ionic bonds.

Life also needs a solvent to carry out the rxns. On Earth that's liquid water. It dissolves many chemicals readily. It expands when freezes, so ice rises to the top, which can lead to frozen lakes. If ice is heavier than water than ponds would freeze through completely. Liquid H2O has a wide temp range, we can see them in the polar regions and in the hot springs. So we can make reactions there.

Ammonia? At low temps it readily dissolves many chemicals similar to aminos. Problem is low temp range: liquid from -78 to -34. It sinks when it freezes.

HF? Wide temp range (-83 to 20). But F is rare in the universe, 100K times less abundant than O to form compounds.

Some people have said that our idea of carbon-based life forms using liquid water is just a very narrow Earth-centered view of life and that on other planets, we would expect to find life with entirely novel biochemistries, almost unimaginable to us. But, in fact, when we go to other planets in our solar system, we don't observe unusual life forms. Are we prejudiced for C-based H2O-solvent life forms?

A future challenge in astrobiology is to really determine if we can make life based of different chemicals, not just C and H2O.
