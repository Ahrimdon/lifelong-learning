## 2.1: Introduction to Law and the Entrepreneur

Once you start signing contracts and hiring employees, that’s when you get a lawyer. You need to find a lawyer that you like personality-wise because oftentimes there are different priorities for the two parties: ents want to move full speed ahead, and lawyers will show potential problems and paths against the roadblocks.

A successful startup needs a team of different people. It’s good to have wise counseling and good advice.

## 2.2-2.5: Employment Prior

Even if an employee hasn’t signed an actual contract for this, they have fiduciary duties (such as "must not compete").

There are usually different agreements for key (high ranking) employees and skilled (engineers, programmers, designers) employees. Check if your new business will be something that will fight your old job.

If an employee has signed an agreement (moonlighting provision) then they can’t do shit yet. Also check if the employee has a non-compete agreement. Ex: California, they don’t enforce NCA that much.

NCA has to be: cannot stand alone (another contract such as employment is needed), actually hurts the employer/not just to stop competition, reasonably limited geographically, scope.

Sometimes this is non-enforcable, and sometimes NCA is an emotional reaction by the employer, so *leave on good terms*.

#### IP

* The question of ownership can destroy companies before they lift off!
* _Invention Assignment Agreement:_ This tells the company that what they employee creates is owned by the employer. In CA/IL, you can keep shit done on your own time.
* Sometimes, by default your stuff is owned by your employer. So make sure that you don’t do something that your employer does, or when you are working in the company itself.
* Just make sure you keep a log that the shit you do on your own time is by yourself.
* Strategies for Leaving Your Employer: When an employer feels insulted by the employee, he may burn bridges lol. Mention shit in the exit interview, who knows you might even get an investment from your former lawyer.

## Readings: Leaving Your Employer

* _No-moonlighting clause:_ Employee is prevented from engaging in any business activities unrelated to the employee’s job with the employer.
* _Non-disclosure agreement:_ Prohibits the entrepreneur from using or disclosing any of the employer’s trade secrets such as a customer list unless the employer authorizes it.
* _Covenant not to compete:_ Agreement to not compete with the former employer for some period of time after leaving the employer.
* Restriction on recruiting your former coworkers.
* Unskilled employees: their work is generally confined to the period of time where they are actually working.
* Activity on the new business must be after-hours: it’s hard to define this because some employees such as software engineers have weird work hours.

_Ex: Before leaving Apple, Jobs chose five employees who would be joining him at NeXT. Apple sued him for breach of his fiduciary responsibilities but later settled for the condition that NeXT would not hire Apple employees for a six-month period and would not solicit Apple employees for a year and for Apple to inspect NeXT’s products before they were marketed._
 
* An entrepreneur may want to hire away a coworker who has access to the company’s confidential information or who has developed special expertise that could be of great value to the new business. But in doing so, the co-worker violates the NDA or a covenant of not to compete. So employees are asked to sign an agreement expressly prohibiting them from soliciting coworkers: no-raid or antipiracy clause.
* The employer can then sue or actually prevent the co-worker from working with the ent. 
* Key employees are even more restricted in how they may approach coworkers. Even in the absence of a no-raid clause, a key employee is liable for breach of fiduciary duty if the inducement is willfully kept from the employer.

#### Covenant Not to Compete

* A _Covenant Not to Complete_ is an agreeement between an employer and an employee that is designed to protect the employer from potentially unfair competition from a former employee.
* Generally 1 year is enough.
* Some states like CA prevent covenants restraining anyone from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business.
* Consent to personal jurisdiction: An agreement to litigate a dispute in a specifically named jurisdication (because people move from state to state for work).
* Remedies for breaching the noncompete clause: injunction requiring the employee to actually stop competing against the former employer, or actual payment of damages.

#### Trade Secrets

* Unauthorized use or disclosure of the employer’s trade secrets Is generally prohibited both during and after employment. Most states have passed statutes that prohibit the employee from disclosing or using trade secrets belonging to the former employer even in the absence of a confidentiality agreement.
* A _trade secret_ is information used in one’s business that is neither generally known nor readily ascertainable in the industry and that provides the business owner a competitive advantage over competitors who do not have access to this information.
* This can be: a formula, pattern, program, device, method, technique, process, or customer list.
* Factors: The value of the information to the business owner and competitors and the amount of effort made to maintain the secrecy of the information.
* Inevitable disclosure doctrine: you can’t work for a competitor firm for a limited period of time if the former employer is able to prove that the new employent will lead him to rely on the former employer’s trade secrets.

#### Invention Assignment Agreements

* All inventions conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by the employee is assigned to the employer.
* CA: this is prohibited if the emp develops entirely in their free time without using employer equipment and not related to the employer’s biz.
Strategies for Leaving
* Just be honest about the real reasons for leaving.
* Offer the employer an opportunity to invest in the new venture. (Goodwill)

## 3.1: Partnerships

* Any time 2 or more people come together, it’s a general partnership.
* The liabilities are a problem because a partner has to pay liability at one point even if one is broke.
* In a partnership, any partner can make a deal outside the partnership. Unless it is in writing, everyone gets an equal part of the company.
* As with a sole prop, everyone has to pay taxes.

## 3.2: C-Corporations and S-Corporations

* A _corporation_ is a separate legal entity from the owners. Instead of a partnership where two people run a business, two people are members of a corporation who runs a business.
* The board makes decisions for the company.
* _LLC (limited liability company):_ If the corp can’t pay its debts as they become due, the shareholders are not personally responsible. Exceptions are when the shareholder guarantees payment of liability, or if someone is injured.
* When you sign contracts, sign it in the name of the business.
* When you want to set the corp up, you need to file a _Certificate of Incorporation_ with the secretary of state of the state where you file your certificate.
* Units of incorporation: shares of stock. Common stock = everyone. Preferred stock = usually for the VCs,  has special economics and voting rights.
* Basic governance is included in a document called the _bylaws_.
* Taxes: Every corporation when it is formed is a _C-corporation_, which means it is required to pay taxes to the government. If it wants to give to the shareholders, it declares a dividend, and the shareholders pay taxes when they receive the money _(double taxation)_.
* To avoid double taxation, a corporation can declare itself as an _S-corporation_. The tax is paid by the shareholders only. Limitations: maximum 100 shareholders, must be US resident, only individuals can hold, no preferred stock.

## 3.3: Selecting an Entity: Limited Liability Company (LLC)

* LLCs are considered to be separate entity too.
* LLCs are more flexible: it could have a formal board, or it could not have.
* The LLC agreement: what the LLC does.
* Voting can be structured separately from the economics of the business, ex: you can be equal owners but have different powers over voting.
* LLCs are formed by filing a document called the Certifcate of Formation. The Cert is basic and the equity types are not included. These are included in the Operating Agreement. The OA contains the rules.
* LLCs can choose to be C-corp, S-corp, or partnership.
* Each states has its own partnership, corp, and LLC law.

## 3.4: Founders’ Agreements

* _This is REALLY IMPORTANT! Even though it is probably awkward and boring, it has to be done._
* Management: Who will be on the board of directors? What percentages would be present?
* This is important for settling deadlocks in the future. When there is a deadlock and there is no agreement on how to break the deadlock, usually someone else or an expert can make the decision.
* It’s more common to put an _absolute prohibition_, or a _right of first refusal_ (owners can choose to buy shares first before another one). Right of co-sale: _“If you find someone to buy your shares, I get to include a part of my shares in that sale.”_
* Sometimes a majority owner feel that if they want to sell the company then the minority shareholders will hold up the deal. A _drag-along provision_ says that only about 80% or something of shareholders have to agree, and these terms will be used.
 
## Readings 3

#### Sole Proprietorship

* A _sole proprietorship_ is a business owned by one person. It has little legal significance separate from its owner and usually requires no governmental filing except under a fictitious-business-name statement (name, address).
	* The owner reports the income and expenses of the business on a schedule to his or her own personal income tax return.
	* Most common in the US.
	* Poor choice because the owner has unlimited liability for the losses of the business, putting their asssets at risk.

#### Corporations

Most large business organizations operate as corporations despite tax incentives to use partnerships.

A _corporation_ is a distinct legal entity owned by its shareholders.

This can be owned by a single person (he is also the director.)

Required officers: president, treasure, and secretary. They are appointed by the board and carry out the day-to-day management.

The shareholders elect the corporation's board of directors.

A corporation has unlimited life: shares are transferred upon a shareholder's death to the shareholder's heirs.

### Primary advantages: 

* _Limited liability as it provides to its shareholders:_ creditors are limited to the assets of the corporation for payment and may not collect directly from shareholders if corporate assets are insufficient to pay all debts and liabilities.
* More familiar (for lawyers, VC)
* Permanent
* Able to transfer corporate stock more easily
* VC is unable to invest in partnerships and LLCs because their major investors are pension and profit-sharing trusts

### Taxation

Unless a corporation elects to be taxed as an _S corporation_, it is taxed as a separate legal entity.

Non-S corporations are called C corporations because they are taxed under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.

Under federal income tax laws in effect on January 1, 2011, a corporation is taxed on its net income at rates from 15-35% (34% on income from $75K-$10M).

Property contributed to a corporation will be subject to tax unless that person contributing the property owns at least 80% of the corporation.

Money distributed by a corporation to its sharedholders is subject to tax again when distributed in the form of dividends; shareholders pay that tax.

### Preserving Limited Liability

Under the _alter ego doctrine_, a court may disregard the corporate entity and hold the shareholders personally responsible for the corp's obligations.

When determining whether to _pierce the corporate veil_, there are several factors:

* Was the corporation undercapitalized, given the risks inherent in its business?
* Were corporate assets used for personal reasons?
* Were corporate assets commingled with personal assets?
* Were the corporate and personal books kept separately?
* Were corporate actions properly authorized by the board of directors or the shareholders?

To preserve limited liability, the corporation should observe at least the following procedures:

* Obtain and record shareholder and board authorization for corporate actions.
* Keep corporate funds separate from personal funds.
* Maintain complete and proper records fro the corporation separate from personal records.
* Make clear in all contracs with others that they are dealing with the corporation.
* Maintain an arms-length relationship between the corporation and any principal shareholder.
* Start the business with sufficient equity and liability insurance to take care of the inherent risks.

#### S Corporations

An _S corporation's_ shareholders can operate it without being taxed as individuals. So they don't pay federal income tax but pass the tax liability for their profits through to their shareholders.

So profits earned by an S corp will be taxed only once. An S corp's losses flow through to the shareholders and may be deducted by the shareholders on their individual tax returns (subject to limitations).

Profits and losses must be allocated based on share ownership for tax purposes.

In non-S corps, a distribution of earnings is taxed twiced: once when the C corp pays federal corporate income tax on profits when earned, and when shareholders dividends are subject to tax. _An S corp is the same as any other corporation except for the way it is taxed._

Shareholders elect S corp status when the corp is profitable and distributes all of its profits to the shareholders, or when the corporation incurs losses and the shareholders wish to use the loss deductions on their personal income tax retursn.

The case for S corp is weaker when the corp is owned solely by insiders who wokr for the company and receive their share of profits in the form of salary and bonuses, which are deductible as expenses.

Outsiders do not receive their share of the profits in the form of deductible salary and bonuses, so when there are a lot of outsiders, S corps are compelling.

### Requirements

* The corp must have no more than 100 shareholders.
* All of the shareholders are individuals, certain tax-exempt organizations, qualifying trusts, or estates. (This prevents the business from raising equity capital from VCs.)
* No non-resident aliens.
* Only one class of stock (although options and differences in voting rights are generally permitted). (This prevents it from having some kind of founder stock).

### Common stock vs preferred stock

Common stock is issued at a price less than that of the preferred stock because it lacks te liquidation, dividend, voting, and other preferences that the preferred stock possesses.

Because an S corp can issue only common stock, it must issue the stock to employees at the same price paid by the investors (unless sold to the founders well in advance of the sale to the investors) if the employees are to avoid being taxed on receipt of their shares.

#### Partnerships

A _partnership_ is a business carried on by at least 2 persons. It is generally treated as a distinct _legal_ entity separate from its partners.

For some purposes, a partnership is treated as an aggregate of its individual partners: it will dissolve on the death of any partner unless the remaining partners elect to continue the partnership.

### Types

* In a _general partnership_, each partner is a general partner, and has unlimited liability for the debts of the partnership. *Each has the power to incur obligations on behalf of the partnership within the cope of the partnership's business.* Each general partner acts as an agent for the partnership.
* A _limited partnership_ has one or more general partners (each of whom has the same liability and power as a general partners in a general partnership) and one or more limited partners. The limited partners liability is limited to the amount of their capital commitment.
* A _limited liability partnership_ is a hybrid: each partner can participate actively in the business and has unlimited personal liability for his own actions, but is liable for the misdeeds of other partners only to the extent of the partnership's assets.

### Partnership Agreements and Mechanics

The partners may generally establish their own business arrangements among themselves by writing a _written partnership agreement_.

Unlike a corp, a partnership will dissolve on the death or withdrawa of a general partner unless the remaining partners elect to continue the partnership. However, a partnership agreement can, and should, provide for alternatives to liquidation after dissolution (ex of agreement: buyout, new partner, continuation).

In a limited partnership, the death of a limited partner does not result in the liquidation of the partnership; the limited partnership interest can be passed on to the deceased limited partners' heirs.

Few formalities: a general partnership does not even require a written agreement.

A limited partnership must have a written partnership agreement and file a certificate with the applicable secretary of states.

*In the absence of a written agreement, state partnership laws will govern the partnership.* Some provisions of the laws may lead to unfavorable results. For example, state laws may require partners to share the profits and losses equally regardless of their original capital contributions.

As a practical matter, brcause a partnership is largely governed by the partnership agreement, which will vary with each partnership, more expense is involved in forming a partnership than a corporation because a corporations's governance is controlled by statutes. Avoid standard or _boilerplate_ forms because they are not tailored to the particulars of the partners' relationship.

### Tax Treatment

*A partnership does not pay income tax.* Income or losses flow through to each partner and are reported on the partner's individual tax returns. A partnership can allocate income and loss flexibly.

Property can be contributed to and distributed from a partnership without being subjected to tax.

A partnership can be converted to a corporation without tax if the incorporation is properly structured. Once a partnership converts to a corporation, however, and distribution from the corporation will be subject to two levels of tax: corporate and shareholder.

Sources of capital are generally restricted to capital contributed by partners and funds loaned by partners and outsiders. It is uncommon for a partnership to raise capital in a public offering, because publicly traded partnerships are taxed as corporations. Most VCs have tax-exempt investors who would receive disadvantaged tax treatment if the fund invested in a partnership. *If you expect to attract capital from a VC, do not organize as a partnership.*

Foreigners participating as a partners would cause them to be treated as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business. So the U.S. would tax any of their U.S. income connected with the trade or business, and the foreign investors would have to file U.S. tax returns. Foreigners generally do not pay tax on income from U.S. corporations in which they invest.

#### LLC

The _limited liability company_ has rapidly gained popularity in the United States. A properly structured LLC combines the pass-through federal tax treatment of a partnership with the liability protections of a corporation.

So an organization that is like a partnership but will become and S corp if given the chance will derive the most benefit from organizing as an LLC because: *it will have limited liability protection while retaining favorable partnership tax treatment*.

The owners (members) of an LLC have no personal liability for the obligations of the LLC. For all practical purposes, an LLC operates as a limited partnership without the legal reqirement of having a general partner who bears ultimate liability for the obligations of the partnership.

Unlike a partnership, an LLC can be formed with only one owner.

It also does not have the limitations of an S corp in terms of ownership (must be individuals, 100, etc.) and in terms of stock restrictions.

### Charter Documents

* A short (1-2 pages) document filed with the secretary of state, which sets forth the name of the LLC, its address, its agent for service of process, the term, and whether the LLC will be governed by the members or by the managers appointed by the members. This document is called the _certificate of formation_ (Delaware) or _articles of organization_ (California).
* _Operating agreement_: Analogous to a partnership agreement. The operating agreement specifies how the LLC will be governed; financial obligations of the members, how profits, losses, and distributions will be shared. (Avoid boilerplates!)

An LLC is not suitable for businesses financed by venture capital funds because of tax restrictions on the funds tax-exempt partners. An LLC can be attractive for businesses financed by corporate investors and by wealthy individuals

An LLC is the entity of choice for a startup seeking to flow through losses to its investors because (1) an LLC offers the same complete liability protection to all its members as does a corporation; (2) an LLC can have corporations and partnerships as members (unlike an S corporation), (3) losses can be specially allocated to the cash investors, and (4) it can be incorporated tax-free at any time.

#### Selecting a C Corp, S Corp, Partnership, or LLC

### Critical Issues

* Who will be the owners of the business?
* How will the earnings of the business be returned to its owners?
* Is the business expected initially to generate profits or losses?

### Who will be the owners?

If the business will be widely held, so much so that it will be publicly traded, then C corp. Investors are more receptive to offerings of corporate stock than partnership or LLC interests because they are easier to understand.

If the owner interests in the business will be provided to employees, then C corp. 

* Stock ownership is *easier to explain* than employees than equity interests in partnerships and LLCs. 
* *Creating favorably priced equity incentives is easiest to accomplish* in a C corp because of the different classes of stock: common stock can be sold at a discount from the preferred. 
* The tax law gives *favorable tax treatment* to incentive stock options (ISOs) granted by a corporation. Holders of ISOs incur no tax until the shares purchased through an option exercise are sold.

*If you want VC money, be a C corp. Most VC funds raise money from tax-exempt entities such as pension and profit-sharing trusts, universities, and charitable organizations, and these would incur unrelated business taxable income on which the non-profit must pay tax if partnership or LLC.*

### How does the business expect to return its profits to its owners?

A business can either distribute earnings to its owners or accumulate and reinvest. (Different rate of tax for long-term capital gain as opposed to current income.)

If a business intends to distribute earnings currently, a tax flow-through entity, such as partn/LLC/S Corp is the entity of choice because the earning scan be distributed without incurring a second level of tax. If a C corp is used, earnings can be paid out without being taxed only if they are paid as salary/compensation to shareholders who work for the business (this is deductible to the taxable income). Distributing earnings to shareholders which are not compensation for services will not be deductible and will even be dividend income tax (!) to its shareholders.

For biz that seeks to build long-term value, C corp (reduction of capital gains tax payable).

### Is the business expected initially to generate profits or losses?

If the biz is expected initially to generate losses, then partn/LLC/S corp because owners can deduct losses from their taxable income.

#### Choosing and Protecting a Name for a Business

Must confirm name is not in conflict with existing. Secretary of state has names of all corporations in the world (even future reserved ones).

Even if SoS confirms the name is okay, there might be another biz using a name that closely resembles the name of another biz organized to do biz in that state. The laws of trademarks might then prohibit the new company from using the name (lolwut).

## 4.1: Intellectual Property

In the U.S., there are four types of IP. Trademark is the brand of the business; it is protected by federal and state law. Copyright protects what lawyers call fixed works of authorship. Fixed means in in writing (or recording or video) and works of authorship means some degree of originality (blog post on company site). Patents protect inventions and designs. Trade secrets are any valuable secret of a company (something that provides a company with a competitive advantage).

## 4.2/4.3: Trademarks/Trademarks – Avoiding

A company's brand is often its most important asset. A trademark is any word, phrase, name, logo, slogan, sound, color or anything that identifies that a particular product comes from a particular source.

Trademark laws were originally used to protect a consumer: you get to expect a certain quality when you see a trademark. Trademarks are important for companies so that they can protect themselves from other competitors.

Trademarks are ranked among a continuum.

- *Just a generic for the product being sold ("water").* You can't use trademark law to protect yourself.
- *Descriptive marks ("Vitamin water").* They describe something about the product, more than a generic word. They aren't entitled to protection off the bat, but over time they can earn secondary meaning in the marketplace, which means that consumers associate the meaning to the product.
- *Suggestive marks ("Icemelt").* They suggest something about the product but don't describe the product specifically.
- *Arbitrarty marks ("Apple").* Words that have a dictionary definition, but aren't connected to a product related to that definition.
- *Fanciful marks ("Xerox").* No dictionary meaning.

How can you avoid a trademark lawsuit? Research first. The test is the *likelihood of consumer confusion*. There are differences that courts look at: similarity of product, similarity of channels... the closer the two products are, the higher the chance.

## 4.4: Copyright Law

An exclusive bundle of rights around a work of authorship.

Work of authorship: Fixed and tangible in form of expression (from computer programs to architecture), and it has to be written down on a piece of paper or saved on a hard drive or recorded.

You can't protect the underlying idea, but you can protect the written words. You can't copyright the idea of two teenagers falling in love, but you can protect the play written with its idea.

Copyright owners have exclusive rights to perform/display/make derivatives of their work. Ex: of derivatives = printing stuff on a shirt.

Fair use: Gives other people the right to make use of some portion of the copyrighted work.

- Purpose and Character of the Use: If commercial or if for non-profit.
- Nature of the Work: Factual material < creative work.
- Amount and substantiality of the portion used wrt the work as a whole.
- Effect on potential profits.

Duration: Life + 70 years if person. If company, 120 years from creation, or 95 years from first publication, whichever is shorter.

Copyright stuff: You don't need to put the (c) or the All Rights Reserved because it is implemented already. It is not required, but it is a good idea.

Better to file protection before the infringement to get greater damages in the event of a lawsuit.

Ex for Jack and Sydney: Instructions for their customers, text on the web site, promotional videos, logo. (People can independently think of a logo, which has to be protected by a trademark.)

## 4.5: Trade Secrets and Patents

Trade secrets can potentially last forever, as long as it is not publicly available. Once the secret's out, it's no longer protected. Someone can independently come up with that idea though.

## Readings 4.1 Chapter 14 Bagley & Dauchey

#### Trade Secrets

A _trade secret_ is any information that provides a business with a competitive advantage from not being generally known by a company's current or potential competitors or readily discoverable by them through legitimate means, and is the subejct of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.

This could be: sales and marketing plans, customer lists and data, software, computer files, manufacturing techniques, formulas, recipes, R&D, survey information, sales data, circuits on chips.

Trade secret protection is unavailable for information that competitors or others obtain through legitimate reverse engineering of a hardware product.

Once a product containing trade secrets is released for sale, trade secret protection is often lost.

Prototypes and information destined for public release can still be protected as trade secrets before they are released.
	
Legal remedies can protect the owner against improper disclosure and use by others. Improper means are: theft, misrepresentation, bribery, breach of contract, and espionage.

When a person discloses or uses a trade secret in violation of a duty of confidentiality, the trade secret owner can use the courts to protect its trade secret rights.

- Preemployment clearance: Company makes sure that its hires (especially when from a competitor) will not use trade secrets of the competitor.
- NDA: This contains a promise by the employee to avoid unauthorized use or disclosure of the company's trade secrets. Everyone signs this.
- Noncompetition Agreements: Prevents employees who leave the company from using trade secrets and other sensitive info.
- Employee Education
- Exit Interview

#### Copyrights

A company's web stie is a copyrightable work. A copyright gives the owner of an original work of authorship the exclusive legal right to obtain certain economic benefits from the work, including the right to prevent reproduction and distribution of the work. He owns the right to:

- Reproduce copies of the work.
- Develop derivate works.
- Distribute copies of the work.
- Perform the work publicly.
- Display the work publicly.

Copyright cannot be used to protect an idea or a certain way of performing some function (it has to be tangible). A business plan may be copyrighted, but that does not prevent another person from developing a business that uses the ideas contained in the plan.

If an idea and teh way it is expressed is inseparably bound, the idea and the expression are said to _merge_, and no copyright protection is available. The maker of a karate video game is inseparable from the moves in actual karate.

We cannot copyright the "+" sign to indicate addition, because there is no other logical and feasible way to express it on a keyboard. We can copyright a story even though it has the theme of "love triumphing over adversity" because there are different ways to express that idea.

#### Fair Use

The law permits others to make limited use of copyrighted materials, including criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarship, and research.

### Factors Considered:

- The purpose and character of the use
- The nature of the copyrighted work
- The amount and substantiality of the portion used
- The effect of the use upon the potential market value.

It depends on the court (fair use is very broad). Kinko's lost to Basic Books when it photocopied without permission and sold portions of text to students, even though it was for education, it cut through profits. Napster was unsuccessful in arguing that its users' sharing of MP3 files constituted fair use of copyrighted songs.

Copyright lasts for the life of the creator plus 70 years.

### To Be Eligible for Copyright Protection

- Fixed in a tangible medium of expression.
- Must be original.
- Must contain some minimal level of creativity (even things such as directions on how to use a beauty product applies).

No action is required to obtain copyright protection, as it arises automatically when an original work of authorship is first fixed in a tangible medium of expression. (It's not legally required to put a notice of copyright protection.)

To prove copyright infringement, you just need to show that the infringer had access to the copyrighted work and that his work is similar to the copyrighted work.

One case, _MGM Studios Inc. vs. Grokster_, had a court rule that "one who distributed a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties."

### Ownership of Copyrights and Works Made for Hire

The employer owns works created by its employees in the scope of their employment. Scope is determined by: right to control (by the employer), who initiated the creation, at whose expense the work was created, time spent on the project, who owned the facilities where the work was created, and the nature and amount of compensation.

#### The Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA)

1998, enacted to provide copyright protection for books, music, videos, software, creative works over the Internet.

- It makes it a crime to circumvent technological antipiracy measures designed to control access to a copyrighted work.
- Outlaws manufacture, distribution, sale of tech and devices that enable consumers to circumvent these measures.
- Makes it illegal to intentionally remove or tamper with certain "copyright management information."
- Okay to crack things for research purposes.

The DMCA contains safe harbor provisions (these protect online service providers from infingement when they innocently store or transmit infringing material by users).

Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988: Holders of copyrights would have the same protection a national would have if the work were produced in that country (although hard to implement in other countries such as China). In 1996 this was extended to cover computer programs and electronic databases.

#### Patents

### Benefits

- Protection for small firms with good technology.
- They can be used defensively as bargaining chips in patent disputes.
- Very complex and technical!

A _patent_ is an exclusive right granted by the federal government that entitles the inventor or patent assignee to prevent anyone else from making, using, selling, or offering to sell the patented process or product in the US for a specified period of time.

A patent does not give its owner the right to use it, it is simply the right to exclude others from it. You need to ask the person you built the patent on for permission (a license or approval).

The application must contain a detailed description of the invention sufficient to allow someone else with ordinary skill in the technical field to make and use the invention without undue experimentation.s

### Types of Patents

- *Utility patents* can cover a machine or a process or an article of manufacture. It can also cover new compositions of matter, or human-made microorganisms. (Improvements to any of these types of inventions can also be connected with a utility patent.)
- *Design patents* can be used to protect ornamental designs. The standard is the "ordinary observer test", where a design patent is infringed if in the eyes of an observer, two designs are the same.
- *Plant patents* protect plants and flowers (rare).

Utility: Patents last 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. Design: 14 years.

### Requirements

- Must fall within a class of patentable subject matter.
- Must be useful.
- must be novel (has not been patented in the world).
- The patent will also be denied if the invention is disclosed to the public more than one year before the date that the patent application is filed. "Disclosed" means used before. Whoever applies for the patent first can win over whoever actually invented the thing.
- Entrepreneurs with patentable inventions should consider filing a provisional patent application just to put a stake in the ground.
- Patents can be sold.

## 5.1: Funding the New Venture: Introduction

Two ways: bank/investor loans, and equity investments. An equity is an ownership interest to the business. An investor is buying part of the business. In corporation, it's shares. In LLC, it's units. In partnership, it's partnership interests. Investors buy the stock from the company, not the founder's shares (lol).

## 5.2: Self-Funding

When it's self-funding (bootstrapping), you only have to worry about losing your own money. Risk: Your own financial well-being, you lose regular jobs, health insurance. You need contacts and additional money.

The next step is friends and family: on the positive side, they bet on you, not the idea. The company will probably have to invest in common stock, not preferred stock. It's good for investors to know that someone else gave money for this.

## 5.3: Angels and VCs

Angels are often wealthy individuals. If you're able to find a good angel investor, that angel can provide funding, advice, and contacts. Angels usaully work with other angels in angel networks.

As angels are getting more sophisticated, they're asking for more terms. They might be asking for preferred equity, records, reports, and even if they are wealthy, they might not be able to provide all the money you need. You want someone with experience already.

VCs are professional investors who bring a ton of money, as well as contact lists. They are able to make connections to strategic partners and doman experience.

VC-capital funding can lead to significant dillution, preferred stock, or management control. VCs can even kick the founders out lol. Getting a VC investment also takes a long time.

Take the right steps early on to make the company attractive to investors further than the road. Make sure the company is set up properly and intellectual property is protected.

Convertible note: those investors have a debt from the company that converts into equity, and has a valuation set from the next round of funding. So the earlier investors need a discount.

Do not cold call or email the VCs, they will think that you are not creative enough to bring it. We need people with different types of background and coachable.

## 5.5: Preferred Equity.

Liquidation preference: First money out goes to the original investors, and preferred return.

Preferred shareholders can also change to common stock, if they get a more profitable deal.

Participated preferred: Preferred shareholders who are also common shareholders.

Some other rights: board members, veto rights, information records (right to check stuff), or restricting others from selling their stock.

Right of first refusal: Someone wanting to sell shares have to offer to the preferred shareholders first.

Drag-along-prevision: If the preferred shareholders want to sell the business, all the other shareholders have to follow, at the same price and at the same terms.

Pre-emptive rights: They have the right to buy their proportionate share of new equities of the company.

Pay-to-play provision: When the company needs money, then everyone needs to put money in, or else they lose some rights.

## 5.6: Securities Laws

They govern the sales of securities (shares of stock or units or partnership interests).

Under the federal securities laws, anytime a company sells securities to somebody else, they have to be registered in the SEC. Registering securities is really expensive. The first time is called the IPO.

Non-public offering/private placement: the company needs to show that all the people offered the securities have the ability to understand the investments.

Don't advertise securities for sale unless you talk to a lawyer. It's also better if you sell to accredited investors.

Private placement memorandum: The stuff you disclose to an investor. These are very important.

## 6.1-6.2: Building a Team/Employees vs. Independent Contractors

*Better to have an A-team with a B-idea rather than a B-team with an A-idea.*

When a company hires someone as an independent contractor, the co doesn't have to withhold income taxes, pay medicare/SSS, comply with hourly minimal wage requirements. When a company improperly classifies someone as an independent contractor, it exposes the co to different liabilities: payment of back taxes, back pay, penalties, and potential violations of the employment laws.

Diff between employees and independent contractors: relationship between the worker and the organization. Factors that the IRS uses to determine: behavioral control, financial control, and the relationship of the parties.

- *Behavioral control*: Requiring workers to go through extensive training. 
- Reimbursing a worker for taxis shows a lot of *financial control*. 
- Things like whether the worker gets paid vacation time and how long the type of work lasts show the *relationship of the parties*.

Good practice: A signed independent contractor agreement. Since they own the work they create, assign the work they create to the business.

#### To protect yourself when classifying independent contractors rather than employees:
- Put independent contractor agreement in place.
- Include a provision in the contract assigning all ownership of work created to the company.
- Don't control the worker too much and give the worker some independence as to how to complete th project.
- Ideally, the IC should have other clients they're doing work for, too.

## 6.3: Employees vs. Interns

#### Fair Labor Standards Act
- Training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employeer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school. The internship has to be _educational_.
- The training is for the benefit of the trainee. The intern has to get something meaningful from the experience.
- The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under close observaition. *You can't fire someone to use an intern instead, or fail to hire someone and use an intern instead*.
- The employer provides the training, derives no immediate advantage from activities of the trainees.
- The trainees are not necessarily entitlesd to a job at the completion of the training period. If they are entitled to a job at the end of the internship, then that means they're getting training for the job, and that means they're supposed to be paid.
- The trainee and employeer understand that the trainee is not entitled to wages for the time spent training. The intern has to actually understand that it's an internship program and not a paid job.

## 6.4: Employment Statutes

Civil Rights Act of 1964, applies to businesses with 15 or more employees: Employees are protected from discrimination on the basis of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, prgenancy, childbirth, against married women.

Times when an employer hires an individual on the basis on the religion, sex, or national origin: women hired to model women's clothing.

Age Discrimination in the Employment Act applies to all companies that affect interstate commerce and have at least 20 employees. Prevention of discriminatory practices for workers >40. Plaintiff needs to establish their case using circumstantial evidence. Then the burden shifts to the employer, to present evidence that it had legitimate business reasons for the decision.

Americans with Disabilities Act: All employers with 15 or more employees, who work at least 20 or more calendar weeks in a year. It prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with known disabilities. It requries the employer to provide reasonable accomodations so that the qualified disabled employee can perform the essential functions of his/her job, unless doing so would constitute and undue hardship for the employer.

Reaosnable accomodations: Work facilities, restructuring jobs/modifying work schedules, acquiring or modifying equipment or devices, modifying examinations, training materials or policies, and providing qualified interpreters.

## 6.5: Equity Compensation

- Grants of share or membership units
- Grants of equity that come with restrictions
- Grants of options to acquire equity, like stock options

Restricted stock: the stock will vest over time or upon the worker meeting specified milestones.

When a share *vests*, all that means is that the restrictions on the stock, like restrictions of transferability or a buyback, go away.

Stock options are options to purchase equity in the future at today's price (you get a chance to buy it in the future).

Equity should always be in a contract. Don't use percentages, use absolute numbers.

## 7.2: Online Trademark and Copyright

An ent needs to actually use a trademark in commerce to be able to stop others from using a similar mark.

A URL is not the same as using it in commerce. So they won't have trademark rights until they're using the brand to sell their product. Also, if their mark infringes on someone else's by creating cxx confusion, it doesn't matter who has th URL, you could still be sued for infringement.

If the text, pictures, video, and music of the websites were created by employees of the company in the scope of their employment, that content is likely classified as a work made for hire, and is owned by the company. So make sure that the copyright and all content on the site is owned by the business.

If you're using stock photos, videos, or music, make sure you get them through a reputable vendor and you pay the correct license fee.

User created content. In the terms and conditions, there should be a statement addressing user content, explaining who owns it. Need the promise from users not to upload content that violates someone else's copyright.

Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides safe harbor for website operators in certain circumstances. The website operator must provide otice on the website of the company representatitve, so they can be contacted if their copyright has been violated.

Part of the DMCA analysis is based on whether the web site operator knew about the copyright infringment.

BTW if you regulrarly monitor and edit postings by your users, youcould be subject to liability from the users, because you edited their content without permission, possibly damaging their reputation.

Third party users who many rely on the user posted content might not know that you're exerting influence over seemingly objective comments. Editing reviews from cx is dicey.

## 7.3: Online Privacy

Many ents address privacy by cutting and pasting privacy policies from other websites, often without even reading or understanding them. This approache can lead to entrepreneurs unknowingly promising consumers they'll treat private information in a particular way, which is completely counter to their actual approach.

Only a few categories of sites are required: 

- If the web site is directed at children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act requires a privacy policy making some specific disclosures and parental consent to use the kids' info being collected.
- Financial institutions
- Health information

Privacy policy should explain what you're collecting and what you're doing with the information you collect.

## 7.4: Online Terms and Conditions

Should be personalized!

Amazon/Gap: They explain how shopping works, how payments work, and so on. They also address ownership of IP on the website and set content standards for user submitted product reviews.

Facebook: They explain how games work, if premium subscriptions are available, cx contracts.

Coach Curiosity: How billing works, disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability.
