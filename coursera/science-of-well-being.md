# Week 1

- G.I. Joe Fallacy - Knowing is half the battle - we actually have to do all kinds of stuff other than knowing stuff to change our behaviour.
- To change our behaviour, we have to change habits.

## Measure your happiness and discover your strengths

- PERMA.
  - Positive emotion
  - Engagement
  - Relationships
  - Meaning
  - Accomplishment
- Authentic Happiness Inventory.
- "On a scale of 1 to 5?"

- Signature strengths:
  - Humor. Liking to laugh and tease; bringing smiles to other people; seeing the light side; making (not necessarily telling) jokes.
    - Humor means to recognize what is amusing in situations, and to offer the lighter side to others. Humor is an important lubricant to social interactions, and can contribute to team building or moving toward group goals. Where other strengths are more or less essential for achieving certain types of goals or dealing with certain types of problems, humor is rarely an essential component to positive social interactions, but it is often a desirable one. It is also a valuable method of coping with distressing situations.
  - Gratitude.  Being aware of and thankful for the good things that happen; taking time to express thanks.
    - Grateful people experience a variety of positive emotions, and those emotions inspire them to act in more virtuous ways – humbler, more persistent, or kinder. Gratitude tends to foster the character strengths of kindness and love, and therefore is closely associated with empathy and with connection to others.
  - Curiosity. Taking an interest in ongoing experience for its own sake; finding subjects and topics fascinating; exploring and discovering.
    - There are two key components to curious individuals: They are interested in exploring new ideas, activities and experiences, and they also have a strong desire to increase their own personal knowledge.
  - Love of Learning. Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's own or formally; related to the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the tendency to add systematically to what one knows.
    - They can still be distinguished though. While curiosity is the motivating force that leads you to seek out new information, love of learning refers to the desire to hold on to and deepen that information. The curious person is motivated by the pursuit of knowledge; the person who loves learning is motivated by the expansion of their fund of knowledge.
  - Hope.  Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it; believing that a good future is something that can be brought about.
    - Hope is more than a feel-good emotion. It is an action-oriented strength involving agency, the motivation and confidence that goals can be reached, and also that many effective pathways can be devised in order to get to that desired future. Optimism is closely linked with having a particular explanatory style (how we explain the causes of bad events). People using an optimistic explanatory style interpret events as external, unstable and specific. Those using a pessimistic explanatory style interpret events as internal, stable and global.
- ***To get you into the practice of doing intentional activities to boost your own happiness, we want to try to use your top strengths this week.***

- Flourishing
  - Deploying your highest strengths leads to more positive emotion, to more meaning, to more accomplishment, and to better relationships.
  - **Exercise: Share an example of something good that happened to you today. Name the character strengths that you used that contributed to the good feelings.**
- Engagement
  - There are seemingly countless ways we might use our signature strengths to engage more at work, at play, and in whatever we are currently focused on. And there is good reason to do so, as workers who reported high strengths use at work were 18 times more likely to be flourishing than those who reported low strengths use. References: Hone and colleagues (2015); Langer (2006); Proyer and colleagues (2013).
  - **Exercise: Engage in a household chore or a work project by thinking of 3 novel things about the activity while you do it. Use your senses and your mindful awareness to experience the task in this new way.**
- Relationships
  - Couples who recognize and appreciate the character strengths of one another have more committed and successful relationships. Put simply: They’re happier in the relationship.
  - **Exercise: Name one example of how your partner has used each of their top 3 strengths in an admirable way. Share this with them and explain why this is important to you.**
- Meaning
  - Workers who use their signature strengths at work are more likely to experience meaningful work – their job becomes a “calling” in their life
  - **Exercise: Align one of your signature strengths with your top 3 work tasks (e.g., running a meeting, filing papers, emailing a customer).**
- Achievement
  - We can directly accomplish more in life by creating goals and taking steps to reach them. Goals can be big or small. The best ones are specific and reachable. Hope is a central part of this.
  - **Exercise: Set a goal of something you would like to accomplish. Build hope by thinking of at least 3 ways you can achieve your goal and at least 3 positive thoughts you can use to motivate yourself to stay focused on it.**

- The PERMA Profiler is a validated, 23-question survey that measures five pillars of well-being known as PERMA: Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment. By taking the survey, you will receive scores ranging from 0-10 for each pillar along with scores for overall well-being, health, and negative emotions.

Should Governments Nudge Us to Make Good Choices?
[Reference](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-governments-nudge-us-to-make-good-choices/)

- Since 2010, for instance, the U.K.'s Behavioral Insights Team, or “nudge unit,” has dramatically improved on-time tax payments simply by telling people about the large number of citizens who paid their taxes on time.
- Despite ample evidence showcasing the benefits of such nudges, commentators from both sides of the political spectrum have labeled them unethical.
- A stronger defense must begin by acknowledging that nudging is unavoidable. From traffic lanes to the size of the popcorn bucket at the movie theater, we are continuously nudged—intentionally or not—by the government, private companies and other people.
- Biases for claiming social security early or late:
  - Present bias, the tendency to opt for immediate short-term gains at the expense of long-term gains.
  - Query theory, or how the order in which people consider options influences how they decide. List reasons why claiming later is better first.

Nudge nudge, think think
[Reference](https://www.economist.com/britain/2014/10/18/nudge-nudge-think-think)

- Payday lenders offer short-term loans at astronomical interest rates. One problem with this market, says the FCA, is that borrowers may suffer from “present bias”. It is not just that people prefer jam today to jam tomorrow; they also fail to foresee that when tomorrow comes, they will have the same skewed preference. This leads to optimism about future behaviour.
- Another contributing phenomenon is “loss aversion”; people dislike losses more than they like equivalent gains. This makes them assign disproportionate value to services they already have. Such inertia on the part of consumers gives firms more leeway to raise prices. That worries Ofgem, Britain’s energy regulator. The average British consumer on a single fuel energy tariff would save nearly £100 a year by switching supplier, yet in the second quarter of 2014 only 2% did so. Ofgem wants firms to simplify their tariffs, making them easier to compare, hoping that will nudge consumers toward action.

# Week 2: Savoring & Gratitude

- When you take part in this savored experience, be sure to practice some common techniques that enhance savoring. These techniques include: sharing the experience with another person, thinking about how lucky you are to enjoy such an amazing moment, keeping a souvenir or photo of that activity, and making sure you stay in the present moment the entire time.
- What do you want most to get in the summer, and what would you feel if you don't get it?
- The How of Happiness?
- People spending money to try to get money: We know that people spend more on lottery tickets, more than books, music, movie tickets, sports teams, and video games combined.
- In 1967, only about 40% thought that you need to be financially well-off, but now almost all did.
- Correlation for salary - the impact really matters when you need to get basic needs. Compared with grandparents, today's young adults have grown up with much more affluence.
- 75K dollars = threshold for the no more happiness going up.
- Do awesome stuff actually makes us happier? But people in the 1940s, they didn't actually have stuff. A materialist attitude has lower life satisfaction than non-materialists two decade later.
- Getting married - they are happier in the first year or two. But after, it's just the same as if they didn't get married.
- Cosmetic surgery - people who get cosmetic surgery sort of are already worse than normal people.
  - And it makes you feel worse?
- Perfect grades do make you more happier, but not as much as we think.
- Why we have misconceptions?
  - Are we really just clueless?
  - Genes as life happiness? There are some glass half full, some glass half empty. 50%.
  - Life circumstances as life happiness? 10%.
  - 40%. The things that we can control. Being intentionally effortful towards being happier.
  - Maybe for everyone else, that's true, but not for me? Intuition is normally wrong.
- Questions:
  - But how does it work for me? Affective forecasting - we're usually wrong in how we think things affect us - like "having this shitty grade" doesn't affect us as bad as we think it does.
  - A lot of perception comes from context or social comparison.
  - Why are we more materialistic or why are we less happy? The American economy sort of relies on us having to buy more things despite having things already.
  - Try to not do things that cause you depression. (Facebook?) We vote with our ATM on what gets to be done.
- I mean the fact of the matter is that all of these things that you have these cravings for certain things these desires are really just that they're just thoughts, they're just thoughts. And sometimes thinking of them as such can kind of cause you to take a step back and really look at your own data about whether those things are helping you. These kinds of techniques have been implemented the most and the best in the context of things like addiction.
- And then the process of mindfulness also forces people to think about like what are you really getting out of this? Like is this really making you happy? And I think that's a technique we can import from treatments of things like addiction into our daily life for things like studying too much for good grades getting worrying about them is not probably as bad as heroin addiction.
- Social media - we assume that the perception is what really is, when they aren't.
- "Why do you do things" eventually goes to a "because I want to be happy" kind of thing.
