## 1 - 2 - Topic 2_ What do we mean by a virtual teacher

So you've probably heard many different terms for virtual education, online learning, distance learning, etc. They just mean learning from a distance and teacher from a distance. 

In the article I provided you called Two Types of Online Learning by Thomas Arnet. He makes the distinction between two groups of student learning online. One way students learn online is through instructional technologies, such as self guided infused web based programs that students learn from without any teacher or personal interface. The other is actual personal interface with an instructor. Virtual teachers not only use personal interaction to teach their online students, but they also utilize instructional technoligies to personalize instruction and get the best result for students. 

I've personally used instructional technologies in a couple of ways, based on what I'm teaching. I've used them during actual virtual lessons where I, maybe share my screen, show students how to work the programs, or how to do something. And then also we are, we work through some problems together. And I've also used them as an additional resource after the virtual lesson. And to, I've used them to asess what I've taught during the virtual lesson. So they can be used in a couple of different ways. 

So virtual teachers, teach at a distance in a couple of different ways. They can work entirely online, where they rarely or never see their students. Virtual teachers also work with blended programs. And blended programs there's lots of different ways that, that schools set up blended programs. But in general, the blended virtual teacher may see their students occasionally or for some part of each day. Third, in a flipped model, and we won't really be talking a lot about flipped model during this course, but that's where the brick and mortar teacher uses web-based programs and to instruct her students when they're not physically with him or her. 

So in this class we will focus on instruction for students who are not in the same physical location, and how to do that effectively. So really this session here, this first session, is really all about distinction. So amongst the different models of teaching virtually, there are also different ways to teach virtually. So, as you know, I work for Connections Learning and they, along with other completely virtual schools like K12, supply the curriculum. So we as virtual teachers do not create courses or content. What we do is we supplement, we enhance, and we personalize the curriculum for students. 

Some other completely virtual schools, they have, the teachers kind of double duty as eh, instructional designers as well, where they actually design their own courses and curriculum, and then teach virtually. I actually had two different grades that I worked with, and it, it's a really unique, blended model, and at the end of this I will give you a link so that you can see a video that the school did and get a better idea of, of what they're doing now. So they've really come a long way, as far as increasing their test scores, and student motivation, and things like that. 

In the next video we will discuss what impact technology has on the field of teaching, not just virtual teaching, but teaching in general. And the, I did provide you two videos.

## 1 - 3 - Topic 3_ What does the growth in technology mean for teachers

We can't get around it, technology and young people are intertwined. And so education must keep up with the way in which students acquire their knowledge, and with the speed of their learning. The greatest thing about technology and the use for students is that we can personalize use, personalize learning by utilizing technology. Students no longer have to be in a one size fits all learning environment. As we talked about in our last video, there are alternatives for students, now using technology in virtual learning. 

I've provided you with this four-minute video about the 21st century learner. It does a good job at covering where we are as educators and where students, students currently are with the growth of technology. Using technology, there's a shift away from the teacher-centric, passing information to students, toward the student-centric model. 

And that's what we do, is we personalize learning for students. Using technology, a school can personalize learning in a couple of ways. With, at first, in a completely online or blend, blended setting, students are generally moving at their own pace. If they need more time on a topic, they can have that time. They can reread texts, rewatch videos, etcetera. If a student understands and masters an objective quickly, they can move on just as quickly. 

Another piece of the personalization is the flexibility of time and space for students. Learning online takes away that need for the traditional brick-and-mortar classroom. Students now, with the use of technology, can get a high-quality education, working completely remotely, or part-time remotely, depending on what serves their learning best. Technology has brought about virtual and blended schools to offer personalization, and the virtual teacher continues this personalization, by understanding learners' individual needs and their interests. The work of the virtual teacher has to do with personalizing the learning, which we will talk quite a lot about during this course. As virtual teachers, many data sources are at our fingertips at all times. 

As I said, our virtual, our jobs as virtual teachers are to personalize learning. And one way we do that is by looking at where students are and what they need. I would look at student performance, and, but also attendance and participation. Hence, teachers coming from a brick and mortar environment were not used to using this type of data and were fairly uncomfortable with it. Most anyways. Now it, it data is common place and we, we couldn't do our jobs without it.

## 1 - 4 - Topic 4_ How do we learn to become virtual teachers

Currently most states do not have specific requirements to teach virtually. A standing teacher, a standard teaching certificate is most often required to teach it online, just as it would be to teach at a traditional brick and mortar school. I learned how to use the, a learning management system, and also my virtual classroom. And both, really by trial and error and from sharing with my colleagues. 

So one organization that has been instrumental in researching and documenting standards for effectiveness, in online teaching, is iNACOL. They began publishing national quality standards in 2007, and since have been fine tuning their resources to provide to virtual schools and teachers to better prepare teachers and schools to provide quality blended and online learning quality standards. I provided you with these teaching standards, in my, in the resources. And many programs and schools do use these as the industry standard of best teaching practices. 

In my own personal experiences interviewing and hiring virtual teachers over the years many often are just leaving these standard teacher preparation programs and have not had the training that they need to walk directly into the virtual teaching world. 

According to iNACOL's research, a national study of teacher education programs conducted in 2012, only 1.3% of them were preparing their teachers for next generation learning models. 

A few important points that they make are, to motivate students, to boost participation. And so, really that's you know, motivating students to come and participate in the virtual process. To always build a strong relationship with your students. To respond to students very quickly. To meet student's personal needs and learning styles To use the data available to personalize learning, and to change it up and make lessons fun. We'll be talking about all of those thing in this class. 

## 1 - 5 - Topic 5_ What do we use to teach online 

So two things that are rather essential to teaching virtually are an LMS, a Learning Management System that holds your curriculum, your student information et cetera, and a virtual classroom or meeting room where you can either record lessons for students to watch asynchronously, or teach a live session synchronously. 

But you might, as a virtual teacher you may encounter needing to decide on a learning management system that would work well for your school. And, there's some similar features to all of the learning management systems you see. And they are that they manage curriculum or training materials, they hold class roster and enrollment information, they manage student documentation, they a lot of times or normally have calendars, discussion forums and email. And you can also create assessments with them. 

Outside of a learning management system, that holds student information, a virtual teacher needs a platform to teach virtually. A virtual classroom such has Blackboard or Adobe has features that enable teachers to instruct students at a distance, either synchronously with student or asynchronously when you want to record lessons to send to students to view later. So again, although there are many out there, they share similar features, such as communication tools, webcam, microphone, things like that. Attendance features, you need to know who's there. Sharing features such as documentation sharing, collaboration tools such as breakout rooms, or whiteboard that students can use in the virtual classroom. Interactivity features if you need to raise your hand, laugh, clap, whatever. Audio features to show videos and play music. Assessment features like poll questions or actual quizzes. And reporting features such as attendance reports or assessment reports. So in your reading resources I have provided you with links to videos so that you can kind of peruse for yourself and, and see the different features of each program. Additionally, if, if you are in the position where you need to set up your own learning, online learning program, I have given you that link as well.
