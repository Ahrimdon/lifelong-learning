## 1.4—Entrepreneurs and Strategic Decisions
Decision making is a cognitive process.
- We have different ways of thinking and having a thinking process
Steps
- Recognizing a problem situation
- Generating alternatives
- Evaluating the various alternatives
- Selecting the alternative that best satisfies our evaluation criteria
Decision making
- You usually have limited information
- There are usually competitors out there
- Accept risk
- Involve major consequences
Setting specific courses of action
- Revenue and profit goals?
- Market share and competitive advantage
- Product superiority and technical advantage
 
Strategic decisions share four fundamental characteristics
- Complexity: facts, variables, and contingencies relevant for the decision at hand
- Uncertainty: all possible outcomes are not known and are difficult to forecast
- Rationality: a specific goal is intended by making a decision
- Control: intentional and deliberate actions are made by decision makers
Environments of entrepreneurs is uniquely challenging.
- Es are doing new things.
- Es are without the resources and relationships typical of established companies.
- Uncertainty and complexity levels are high.
- Consequences of failed decisions include failed biz, significant financial and emotional pain.
Summary
- Understanding entrep decision making is critically important for earliest stages
- Without opportunity discovery, there's no venture
- Decision-making is a unique and significant task for Es
 

## 1.5—Entrepreneurial Mindset 1
Es cause entrepreneurship.
- Market opps, tech changes, and other factors influecne entreps, but the entrep is at the heart of the matter.
- Without the E, there is no entrepreneurship.
Understanding Es
- Who are they?
- What do they think?
- How do they think?
- What influences their decision?
Entrepreneurial Mindset
- Need for Achievement—Defined as a preference for challenge, an acceptance of personal responsibility for outcomes, and a personal drive for accomplishment.
- Individualism—This doesn't mean you want to work alone all the time. This means that when doing the challenging and difficult things, that you are willing to do things even if others don't agree. You listen to others but you think that it is okay to go against the norm. High individualism is associated with an emphasis on individual initiative and achivement.
- Control—If you have an internal view, you have a belief that you control your destiny and influence outcomes.
- Internals: They are in control of what happens in their life.
- Externals: They attribute stuff to luck, or markets, etc.
- Internals are more alert and discover more opportunities than externals.
Summary
- What roles does the need for achievement play in your decisions?
- How does individualism influence your decision making?
- Do you have an internal and external locus of control?
 

## 1.6—Entrepreneurial Mindset 2
Focus
- Attention + commitment
- You may be curious about something but in order for you to be focused you must commit to it.
- Entreps are able to focus attention on a single task.
S.M.A.R.T. Goals
- Specific/Significant
- Measurable/Meaningful
- Attainable/Action-Oriented
- Relevant/Rewarding
- Time-bound/Trackable
Instead of "I would like to sell a lot of books", think "I will sell 100 books for $1 each by this Friday"
Optimism
- Leads entrepreneurs to frequently make judgments on subjective positive factors
- Excessive optimism can lead to high levels fo risk acceptance and loss
Moderate optimism to improve success
- Objectively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your solution, and examine potential problem areas
- Gather info from potential cx, experts, knowledge friends and family, etc. 
 

## 2.2—Entrepreneurial Motivation
Entrepreneurial Motivation
- Self-efficacy
- The belief in your ability to accomplish a specific task (being confident)
- This is tied to control and confidence (you may be confident with numbers if you like numbers)
- A top predictor of individual performance in a wide variety of tasks.
- Cognitive motivation
- Individuals high in need for cognition tend to seek, acquire, think, and reflect on relevant information
- Individuals low in need for cognition tend to rely on experience, assumptions, and luck
- Tolerance for ambiguity
- The tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable rather than threatening
- Importatn to be able to make complex decisions quickly with limited information
Cognitive biases and heuristics common in entrepreneurship
- Overconfidence: While helpful in some cases, you sometimes take risks you don't have to take.
- Representativeness: Making a conclusion based on what you just see from a small group of people/stereotyping.
- Counterfactual thinking: Always thinking "what might have been if...". It's okay to feel bad but don't try to latch on to every opportunity for fear of missing out on something.
 

## 2.3—Entrepreneurial Behavior
Entrep behavior skills
- Confidence: Self-doubt can result in doubts from your team, partners, investors, customers, etc.
- Interpersonal relationship skills: Driven by likeability and communication skills. This makes it easier for you to connect with individuals and to connect with their connections.
- Take the time to study and develop your personality.
- Social capital: The resources available in and through personal and professional networks. Not just more but more diverse. People with rich social capital are better informed, more creative, more efficient, and better problem solvers.
- Risk tolerance: Addresses your willingness to accept risk: different from a desire for risk.
 

## 2.4—Entrepreneurial decision-makers and the use of biases and heuristics
- Entreps are more likely to have personal biases and subjective stuff
- We have to work with incomplete data and need to make faster and cheaper decisions
 
- We want to have a shorter time through the loop
- Dangers: Hasty decisions, incomplete analysis, squander resources, new biases
- Instead of trying to make a decision based on representativeness, research and talk to experts
- If we are overoptimistic and overconfident, we are setting ourselves for failure
- Why are we subject to the "representativeness" heuristic? Not enough resources to collect or analtze data, fear of missing opportunities, sense of urgency
Best practices for managing the representativeness & overconfidence
- Actively search for information
- Define assumptions
- Consider alternatives
- Estimate the consequences
- Work as a team
- Ask for advice
 
 
Customer discovery and validation is central to the decision to launch the firm.

## 2.5—Risk taking in entrepreneurial decision making
- Do entrepreneurs show higher natural tendencies to take risks?
- No, not consistently, but perceptions of risk may differ. People's perceptions of risks are different from each other.
- Other factors are motivating entrepreneurs to start firms besides risk propensity.
- How does the cognitive complexity of individual entrepreneurs relate to their risk propensity?
- Strategic entrepreneurial decisions are inherently risky
Why do entrepreneurs engage in risk?
- Lack necesary info
- Develop an inside view of decisions they face
- Ignore elements of past situations
- Favor positive possible outcomes
 
Key influencing factors of entreps accepting risk
- How high are the risks?
- What are the rewards?
- What are the consequences?
- Were all of the complex elements of the decision considered?
Industry dynamism influences entrep decision-making
- Relationship between cognitive complexity and risk-taking behavior is negatively moderated by the dynamism of the industry in which the decision takes place
Keys for Es to assess real risk and improve decision-making
- Apply multiple perspectives to a decision situation
- Integrate these perspectives into the decision
- Use a complex cognitive framework regarding a decision situation
Summary
- Es tendencies to take risks are influencesd by perception and relative risk and reward.
- Es engage in risk for a unique variety of reasons that are personally important to them.
- It's important for Es and aspiring Es to accurately assess risk and thereby improve their decision-making.
 

## 3.2—Exploring Real Market Needs
- To create a successful new company, you need to introduce a product or service that satisfies cx needs in a better way than competitors, and at a price that is greater than  the cost of creating and delivering that product or service.
- Ask yourself: Does the cx have an unsolved problem?
- Is there a significantly better way  of solving a cx's problem that an existing product or service provides?
- Can you introduce a sustainably better price for the cx?
- For a real need to exist, the new product cannot be just a bit better.
Gathering info
- Screw "I am seeing something the market doesn't see"
- Good clues: cx complaint, expression of an unfulfilled wish. Ex: online reviews.
- Focus group/surveys
- Examine forecast trends/potential adoption patterns
- When the product is truly new, the cx may not understand his/her needs for it.
- Think of a niche, think of a price point, make it competitive.
- Do not oversegment, FOOWM.

## 3.3—Satisfying Real Market Needs
- Use social network to get feedback constantly.
- Understand how to market and sell new products and services because sometimes the best marketed products often outsell the best products if not marketed well.
- Focus on the process of personal selling.
- Examine competitors' financials to help scope your own financial forecasts and goals.
Find changes
- Tech —because new tech means new innovations, think of the apps market
- Social change—Deodorant, teeth whitening, check the values of the people in your market. Demographics: aging population.
- Changes in industry—Capital, advertising, concentration, firm size, check if market competitors are competitive
 

## 3.5—Assessing entrep opps
Pitfalls
- Lack of objective evaluation: You fall in love with a concept too much.
- Limited knowledge/insight of market
- Legal issues
- Poorly constituted team
Critical Factors
- Cx availability
- Product availability
- Sales growth
Why New Ventures Fail
- Product/market problems: little cx understanding, not truly differentiated, trouble establishing the brand
- Financial: Spend on things that do not influence success
- Managerial problems
Competitive Advantage
- New, proprietary, patented or copyrighted, or unique enough that can beat clones
- How can this be prototyped/tested by the cxes
 

## 4.2—Environmental Assessment of Entrep Ventures
Sustainable Competitive Advantage
- Achieved when a venture has implemented a strategy that other companies do not duplicate.
- Can only be maintained until competitiors are able to duplicate or develop a substitute.
- The pursuit of this competitive advantage reqires a full complement of commitments, decisions, and actions by the entrepreneur
Environmental Scanning
- General environment: Demographic, economic, political/legal, socioculturalm technological, and global segments.
- Industry environment: New entrants, suppliers, buyers, product substitutes, intensity of rivalry among competitors
- Competitor environment: Current and new
- Regulatory Environment: Managerial regulations, technology regulations, price regulations, competitive regulations
Examining the Environment
- Environment: What is the structure of the industry? How is it likely to evolve over time?
- Industry: Tech uncertainty, strategic uncertainty, first-time buyers.
Five Competitive Forces that Determine Industry Profitability  
- Rivalry determinants: Industry growth, fixed costs, product differences, brand identity, switching costs, concentration and balance, diversity of competitors, exit barriers.
- Determinants of buyer power
- Bargaining leverage (concentration, volume, switching costs, information, backward integrate, substitute products).
- Price sensitivity (Price/total purchases, product differences, brand identity, impact on quality and performance, buyer profits, decision makers' incentives).
- Determinants of supplier: inputs, switching costs, substitute inputs, supplier concentration, importance of volume to supplier (they need bulk stuff), cost relative to total purchases in the industry, impact of inputs on cost or differentiation
- Entry barriers: What do we need to get into the market we want to go in? Economies of scale, proprietary product differences, brand identity, switching costs, capital requirements, access to distribution. (Easy entry for you = easy entry for others)
- Determinants of substitution threat: Relative price performance, switching costs, buyer propensity

## 4.3—Selecting the Right Industry
- Dying businesses: pay phones, coin-operated arcades, record stores, bookstores, newspapers
- Attractive industries: Mobile app design, exam preparation, home health care, tea and healthy beverages, safety and quality testing
- Knowledge conditions: Do you need stuff such as R&D, or do you need stuff suchas financial capabilities, locations, and relationships?
- Demand conditions: Are they growing, what is the rate, and are they heterogenous.
- We want to segment. The degree of segmentation is the degree to which the customer base of an industry wants different features in the products or services it demands.
- Market segmentation: How can you find a niche that is sizeable to reach your goals, yet small enough to be unattractive to large companies?
- Ex: Peer Advantage tutors: Connecting UMaryland students with a 3.5 GPA tutor students who live in an area very near the university.
- Industry life cycles: Beginning, middle, or end? Easier to get cx than to steal cx from another company.
- Industry structure: Capital intensity, advertising intensity, firm concentration, average firm size.
- 275K developers in the USA. Online marketplaces like elance.com and odesk.com provide matchmaking opps for devs and clients.
 

## 4.4—Types of Innovations
- Introducing something new
- Commercializable improvements: Invention or improvement
 
- Product innovation: Introduction of a product that is new or substantially improved. Ex: Herman Miller chair.
- The "download by track versus download by album" model was really important.
- Business model innovation
- Supply chain innovation: Dell builds PCs based on the order.
- Marketing innovation
- Organizational innovation

## 4.5—Strategic Positioning
- Defining a company position, making trade-offs, forging fit among activities.
- Principle #1: Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities:
- Serving few needs of many customers, or serving broad needs of few customers?
- Warby Parker cuts out the middleman
- Principle #2: Strategy requires you to make trade-offs in competing to choose what not to do.
- Focus on developing a solution and a brand that is meaningful and consistent to customers.
- Ex: Amazon before was about books. Books and music were easy to ship, they were able to build the shopping carts, etc. After a time, they enterred consumer electronics, then computers, then shoes, but they started with books.
- Principle #3: Strategy involves creating a "fit" among a company's activities. 
- Wal-Mart has low cost but is not posh. Nordstrom has a higher cost but has a more personalized service.
 

## 4.6—Strategic Planning

Fatal mistakes
- Misunderstanding industry attractiveness
- No real competitive advantage
- Pursuing an unattainable competitive position
- Compromising strategy for growth
- Failure to explicitly communicate the venture's strategy to employees
Milestone planning
- We should have logical and practical milestones
- After x months, what is working? What is not working?
But why not?
- Time scarcity
- Lack of knowledge
- Lack of expertise/skills
- Lack of trust and openness
- Perception of high cost
 

## 5.2-5.3—The Business Model Canvas
- A biz model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value.
Cx segments: Separate if
- Needs require and justify distinct offer
- Reached through different distribution channels
- Require different types of relationships
- Have substantially different profitabilities
- Are willing to pay for different aspects
Segments
- Mass market (Coke): One large group
- Niche market (Specific, specialized customer group)
- Segmented (Slightly different customer groups)
- Diversified (Multiple, unrelated customer segments)
Value Propositions
- Describe the bundle of products or services that create value for a specific cx segment
- What value are we delivering to the cx?
- Quantitative: Price, cost reduction, risk reduction, convenience, usability
- Qualitative: Newness, performance, design, brand, customization
Channels
- How can we integrate/measure which channels work best.
Revenue
- Transaction or recurring payments
- Ask, for what value are customers really willing to pay? What do they currently pay for?
- Buying (asset sale), renting, subscription, licensing, advertising
Key Activities
- Most important things a company must work to make its business model work.
Key Partnerships
- Strategic alliances, joint ventures, buyer-supplier relationships, coopetition, strategic partnerships between competitions.
- Motivations: Optimization/economy of scale, acquisition of resources, reduction of risk
Cost Structure
- R&D, operations, marketing, post-sales.
- Cost-driven: Leanest possible cost structure, lowest price value
- Value-driven: Personalized service

## 5.4—Patterns of Biz Model Generation
Free as a Business Model
- For one segment, free
- Non-paying: Financed by another part of the biz model
- Ex: Google, ESPN homepage with an ad, ESPN shop, ESPN Insider for premium content
- Advertising: You need a substantial user base first!
- Freemium: Measure the cost of serving a free user and the rates of converting free to paying cx
Multi-sided Platforms
- Brings value by connecting two distinct but interdependent group of cx (ex: Kickstarter)
Open Business Models
- Creates and captures value by systematically collaborating with outside partners.
- Ex: Tech licensing.
 

## 5.5—Designing Biz Models
- Designer's business: Create the new, discover the unexplored, achieve the functional.
- Designer's job: Extend the boundaries of thought, create new ideas.
- Tool: Empathy. What is the cx's pain? Gain?
Visual Thinking
- Visualize with drawings: Customer needs and wants. Competitor and market forces. Design alternatives.
- To improve:
- Understand the essence
- Enhance dialogue
- Explore ideas
- Improve communication
Prototype!!!
Scenarios
- Guides the design of the new business models. Come up with customer settings and scenarios on what will happnen.
 

## 5.6—Strategies for Biz Model Generation
- We reconcile: cost and buyer value.
 
- Break the v-c trade-off: Can we get to be cheaper yet have a decent quality?
Differentiating Cirque de Soleil from Traditional Circuses
- Not a traditional circus. No stars and high-priced celebrities, no animal shows, no concessions, no multiple show arenas.
- Still has fun/humor, unique thrills.
- Different theme, artistic music and dance.
Four Actions Framework
Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
Which factors should be reduced well below the industry's standard?
Which factors should be raised well above the industry's standard?
Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?
 

## 6.2—Keys to Raising Financial Capital
Pitch Outline
- Introduction
- Opportunity and Problem
- Your solution
- Market Analysis
- Competitive Advantage
- Team
- Financials
- Tell them what rounds would mean
- Growth strategy (Ex, Year 1: Establish 3 profitable locations)

- Stabilize or expand?
- Take-off? Can we delegate responsibilities/will there be enough cash.
- Maturity? How can we consolidate to develop efficiencies?
 

## 6.3—Building Financial Statements
- Ents understand the value of the company and when it's time to raise capital for the venture.
- Income statement: Summarizes revenue and expenses.
- Cash flow statement: Money in and money out.
- Balance sheet: Summarizes the assets, liabilities, and equities.
Income Statement Definition
- Revenue
- Costs of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Direct costs to produce each product
- For a product, all competing costs
- Revenue forecasts: What can we sell, given the market, our pricing, and our capability?
- COGS forecasts: How will out COGS change as our revenues change?
Statement of Cash Flows
- Reports cash receipts and payments over a period
- Activities
- Operating activities: Cash changes by operating the company
- Investing activities: Cash changes from buying/selling assets

## 6.4—Srcs of Financial Capital
- The bulk of it comes from the personal savings of the individuals themselves. People want to see you pitch money in first.
- Amount needed determines who is interested. First $10K-$25K = founders, friends, family money, and crowdfunding.
- Angels invest at the $25K-$250K level.
- Banks like deals with hard assets (collateral).
- Investors are the option if the money will be used to pay for the day-to-day operating expenses, no collateral.
Bootstraps
- Advantages: Owned by founders, easy ownership terms, controlled by founders, lower pressure, little time spent on fundraising
- Disadvantages: Limited capital, lack of funding commitment, loss of advice  from prof. investors
Debt vs Equity
- Debt Financing: Payback of the funds plus a fee.
- Advantages: Grater return for equity.
- Disadvantages: Need to pay money back, cash-flow problems, personal guarantee.
- Equity Financing: Involves the sale of some of the ownership interest in the venture. (No legal obligation.)
- Initial screening, evaluation of the business plan, oral presentation, final evaluation.
Crowdfunding
- Easier to get 1M people to give you $1 each rather than a few people give you $10K each.

## 6.6—Objective of the Business Plan
Problem
- How many buyers, in number and in dollars?
- How painful is it to the market?
- How it the problem dealt with today?
Solution
- Unique advantage

Unequal advantages
- Unequal, but legal/ethical
- Intellectual property, unique process, unique position, unique relationship, unique go-to-market advantage, unique advantage in operations, sustainable price point advantage
Competition
- How else can prospective buyers fix problems or find satisfaction?
- ANYTHING THAT WILL HINDER SALES
Financial
- 3-5 financial projections, possible "exit" scenarios.

Mistakes
- Too long. Summary: 1 page. Investor presentation: 10 slides/20 minutes.
- Poor positioning: No validation. Study markets first. Your solutions and/or technology has to look for someting to solve.
- Lack of focus: If you have multiple opportunities, break them into phases.
- No real world market analysis: Use bottom up numbers, not top down. Prove you have a reachable market.
- No cockpit gauges: What are the top three drivers or metrics of your business?
- Unclear business model: How will you make money, and how will you scale up?
- Poor or incomplete competitive analysis: Disclose all the possible competition and do your homework.
- Weak team information: Admit that you have holes in a team (inexperience, lack of resources, be honest).
- Poorly defined leverage points: Who has vested interest in your success?
- Goofy fundamentals that distract: Get "adult supervision" first.
- Support your plan!
