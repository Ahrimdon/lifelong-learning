# Week 1

## Introduction to the Course

Kindiness: altruism or pro-social behavior. As when, with no obvious payoff, we're nice to another individual. Without prompting, a toddler opens a cabinet when the adult can't get it opened.

There's kindness, but there's also cruelty. There's evil. There's viciousness. Think of the woman who threw the cat in the garbage can. Strangers were mad at her. They weren't involved. They weren't harmed.

And I think this sort of incident tells us something interesting about morality. Which is that morality matters. When I see something evil being done, even if I'm not involved in it, there's often a punitive impulse. There's an impulse that. The perpetrator should be punished. Justice should be done. And the question of where that comes from, how the system evolved.

How on the one hand do we have a psychology built for empathy and compassion and kindness, as in that child helping the man. And in another way have a psychology built for justice, for punishment, as in the case of the attacks on this woman.

Where does this all come from? And those are questions that occupy us. We'll also be interested, and this is my third example, in human differences. Hundreds of years ago, in the state of Conneticut in which I'm lecturing, people owned slaves. That is people owned other people.

I would imagine very few of you think slavery is right. Very few of you think slavery is moral. But hundreds of years ago people did practice slavery. And many people thought it wasn't wrong. In fact, many people thought that slavery was a moral institution justified by the Bible, justified by history.

What can we say about the psychology of the people back then who thought so differently from how we think? And what can we say about the changes that brought us form then to now? What is the proper explanation for why our views about something like slavery Have changed so radically over history.

Now moral differences aren't just a matter of history. They're not just a matter of then versus now. They're also a matter of clashes between cultures.

One view of things, the view which I actually hold is that the, the, the mass murder of Americans was a horribly immoral act. And the punishment however to punishment or murder of Bin Laden was a just retribution.

But there are many people around the world who see things very differently. They might see that hack on America as a just, reasonable, moral act and the murder of Bin Laden as a cowardly retaliation. The people who orchestrated That hacks 9/11 were not by any standard insane. They were not by any normal standard psychopaths.

Rather, they were driven by a moral vision. Now, again, some moral vision eyes see as grossly mistaken but they see mind as grossly mistaken and at the very minimum then What we need to do as scientists interested in morality is come to grips with the fact that people have such different moral views.

And understand why we have these moral views, where they come from, and possibly how we can deal with these conflicts. Now these are all examples of moral differences between different societies separated by time. Or separated by space. But we could also ask about moral differences within a society.

So in the United States, there's huge differences in how people think about the morality of same sex relationships of gay couples. Again, the point of this course is not trying to commit you to, this view is right or that view or right.

That is just out of the bounds of what we'll be doing here. But we're very interested in, why do some people think this and why do some people think that.

I think this is a question of, both, great intellectual importance, and also great practical importance. And more generally I think, this course will, will talk about specific cases like that, but also deal with foundational issues, that, that I just find incredibly interesting.

So one such foundational issue, is attention between. Moral reasoning. Deliberative conscious thought, decision making thinking things through, the head, and your gut feelings. Your compassion, your emotion, your love, your disgust, your anger, your shame, the heart. And psychologists and philosophers along with theologians and legal scholars and many others Have long tried to address the question of the relative roles of reason and the emotion. In how we le, lead our moral lives and how we come to our moral ideas.

Even more generally than that, we will address the tension between what we call humanistic views. Our humanistic conception of humanity. Which deals with notions like free will. That sees people as, as agents that can make decisions. That can be blamed, that can be praised, that can be guilty. That, that, that, that can warrant punishment or warrant reward.

A view that might see us as almost as spiritual beings. Not reducible to the physical or, or mechanistic world. Beings with, be beings with souls. Creatures capable not only of wrongness, but also capable of sin. You have that and you have that humanistic view.

And then you have a scientific view. And a scientific view tries to explain our natures in terms of the language of neuroscience, the language of neurons and dendrites, and the limbic system, and the frontal lobe. The language of genes, talks about environmental cues, talks about the effects of parenting, the effects of, of, of one's physical, and social, and emotional environment.

And the question that will occupy us that has occupied me for as, as long as I could remember, is can we reconcile these two views. By our genes and by our environment. Can we say that, and also say that people make choices. And that people should be blamed for their choices or praised for their choices. That people are moral creatures more than anything else on this planet.

Can we reconcile the humanist perspective on us in a scientific perspective? And that's something that we'll be struggling with throughout this course.

So, why would you want to take this course? One reason is the topics are just fascinating. I, Again, I'm, I'm admittedly biased, but who isn't interested in the question of why do some people become violent psychopaths. Who isn't really interested in questions of how are liberals Different from conservatives. How are the fundamentalists different from atheists? How are they better people? Are they worse people? What's the evidence?

A second reason to take the course is that, as we talk about these issues of morality, we will be discussing, and reading, and learning about different domains of both the sciences and the humanities. So a lot of the basis for this work will come from psychology. And we will read and talk about social psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, neuroscience as well as other domains.

The third reason to take the course, and I'm raising this maybe most tenatively. Is that it might make us better people. I am under no illusion that after having read about the studies of morality and read the developmental work and anthropology and neuroscience, that will then be particularly well equipped to say oh now I know that's right and that's wrong. I think understanding them more has nothing but positive benefits.

Why my politics is this and my religion is that And my belief about charity is this. Why I believe these things, I think that understanding where these beliefs and behaviors come from will actually help us in a better way improve on our moral lives.

## 1.1: What is Morality?

The first is there's no definition of morality that people agree on. So the philosopher Stephen Stich points out that philosophers have deep differences over what morality is.

There was a book published in 1970 called Definitions of Morality. And in that book. 13 of the best philosopherss in the world. Philosophers like Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Strawson and Philippa Foot provided their definitions of what morality is. And Stich points out these definitions had very little in common. People had very different views. It doesn't get any different when you look at psychologists.

So the very prominent psychologist, Elliot Turiel, who's done significant work in the psychology of morality, defines morality in a pretty narrow way in terms of justice, rights, and harm. For him, something only counts as immoral if there's a victim, if someone suffers.

In contrast, Jonathan Haidt, whose work we're going to talk about throughout this course. Has a much broader definition of morality. For him, anything that suppresses self-interest and makes cooperation possible is part of morality.

So for Haidt, a religious ritual might be part of our moral psychology, part of our moral life. For Turiel it wouldn't be. So given the sort of disagreement, it would be arbitrary for me to pick out a single definition of morality and go with that.

Also, my view is that beginning with a definition is never a good idea when you're dealing with scientific questions.

Rather what you do is you begin with a rough idea of what you're talking about, and then you're understanding what counts as falling within that domain shifts as a result of your understanding.

I think if we ever get a definition of morality, it means we're kind of finished, the study of it. And we're nowhere near that point now. We're just beginning. Still, in order to study anything, you need a rough idea what you're studying and so I want to begin with, by talking about what counts as a moral violation. What counts as something wrong?

It's related to notions of reward and punishment. Good things are rewarded and bad things are punished and it's related to emotion such as guilt, shame anger and gratitude. Wrong behavior evokes certain emotional responses. Now, this is a simple example of moral violation. Obviously not the worst thing you could imagine, but a sort of simple and direct. But, there are other moral violations that don't quite fit this mould.

So for one thing, you don't have to, make physical contact to somebody, in order to do something wrong. Most of us would believe it's wrong to shout a racist insult at somebody, or threaten to kill them, or spread lies about them. You could harm people in ways that aren't physical.

You could be immoral by negligence. So, if after the filming of this lecture I get together with the gentlemen operating the cameras, we all get roaring drunk. And I get back into my car and start to drive home. Most people say I'm doing something wrong. Not because I have any ill feelings not because I've hurt anybody, but because I'm, I'm foolishly acting in a way which could harm people.

You could be immoral in some cases by not doing anything at all. So if I choose not to feed my dog, then my dog starves to death. That's awful. If I choose not to feed my child, my baby, that's even more awful. That's murder.

Because I have obligations to those individuals that require, that morally require, that I do things. Now there are some cases where What counts as immoral is different from what counts as illegal and these cases are particularly salient with regard to issues of when you should do something.

So I'm thinking particularly of an example. A few years ago, these two guys Jeremy Strohmeyer and David Cash Jr., they go into a casino in Nevada. And Jeremy Strohmeyer sees this little girl. Gets her to come with him into the women's bathroom, and molests and murders her. He is later caught, you know, charged, sentenced.

Plainly what he did was terrible. But I'm more interested here in what his friend did, which is nothing. His friend sort of said, half-heartedly, tried to get Strohmeyer to stop, got bored, and went for a walk. Now it turns out he didn't do anything legally wrong. At the time in Nevada it's not a crime to allow somebody else to do a crime. And in fact, so, so he wasn't charged with anything. And in fact he didn't really feel wrong about what he did. He was later interviewed on the radio. And, and when he was asked his feelings, he said he said this.

The simple fact remains I don't know this little girl. And then he, he said more generally, I don't know people in Panama or Africa who are killed every day, so I can't feel remorse for them. And he went on, why should I feel remorse for this girl? I didn't do anything wrong.

Other people disagreed. And although he was never charged with a crime because he didn't commit the crime, there were protests, there were, there were people. He was a student at University of California at Berkeley, and people protested, demanded that he get thrown out of school. For what he did. And even now, years later, if you look up his name online you'll see there are people stalking him. They don't know him. But they'll stalk him. They want to make sure that, that everybody knows what he did, and that he suffers for what he did.

And this is another, this is a way in which morality can have broad scope. Another sort of example. Is that not all moral violations involve victims. Or least they don't always involve victims in clear and obvious sense. I have here a list of some things. Most of which are illegal in the United States.

> Drug use, voluntary selling of bodily organs, prostitution, homosexuality, bestiality, incest between consenting adult siblings, cannibalism

Homosexuality used to be illegal in the United States. There were sodomy laws that were applied almost exclusively to homosexuals. Now, due to a Supreme Court decision, it's no longer illegal. The rest are still, in various forms, illegal, and they're illegal in other countries as well. 

Now your mileage may vary. Some people will look at this list and say, I don't see anything wrong with all of that. I mean, I don't want to indulge in any of this, but what consenting adults do is fine. It doesn't bother me. Others will see some of these as morally wrong.

And you might see some of these as morally wrong because you believe there really is a victim. You might think that although prostitution involves, on the face of it, consenting adults and so on, Still, the institution of prostitution is coercive and really does make people's lives worse. 

Or, you might think that these are wrong, not so much because they harm somebody but simply because they're wrong. Take consensual cannibalism. Somebody dies, and in their will they say, after I'm dead someone else could eat me. It's all consent, and so on. But some people say that's just not right. I don't care if nobody's harmed. We shouldn't be doing that, to one another.

And this is part of the scope of morality. You, you also get cases where, there isn't apparent harm, and it seems wrong, even when it doesn't rise to the level, of a crime. Suppose I get together with my friends, say fellow Yale professors. Suppose we are sitting in a club, we're sipping sherry, and we're all white males. And we start enga-, telling jokes, and we say, you know, sexist jokes and racist jokes, the most foul jokes you could imagine. But still, we're telling, we're telling the jokes and we leave and we're happier than when we came in.

And nobody hurts and nobody's feelings were hurt. But still, there is the intuition in at least some of us that, that was wrong. You know, you shouldn't be doing that sort of thing. So, the scope of morality is broad. I'm trying to sort of persuade you that what counts as right and wrong has, has broad scope.

Morality is everywhere. A lot of my examples involve sex, and clearly, many, there are certain acts of sex that most everybody find wrong. You, people find it wrong, the idea of sex with a young child. Certainly sex that involves coercion is wrong. People have different attitutes about promiscuity, virginity, heterosexuality, homosexuality bisexuality. Bestiality, masturbation, fetishes. And these differences are profound.

What counts as a, a moral violation for one person could be a point of pride for another. This guy walks into a church. And he goes to a confessional booth. And he immediately says, Father, I'm 70 years old. And I have sex. I have had sex with two 20 year olds. And the priest is kind of stunned. And says, how long has it been since your last confession? And the guy says, I've never been to confession before. I'm not Catholic. And the priest says, so why are you telling me this? And the guy says, I'm telling everybody.

What could be a point of pride to one could be a point of disgust to another. Food. Most people have some moral restrictions on what to eat. For some of us, these moral restrictions are grounded in religion. Other people have more restrictions on what they can eat because of concerns about the suffering of animals. Or worries about damage to the ecosystem.

The most obvious cases of morality, involve family and friends. So, we feel moral obligation towards our family and friends, we, we feel gratitude when people do right by us, betrayed if they don't. The most obvious example is the obligation that a mother or father has towards a child. But these obligations extend. They extend towards siblings. They extend towards people who aren't related but are married, are close friends and so on.

Morality applies to strangers as well. Many of us give to charity and many of us give to charity to help people we don't know and who will never help us back. Even if you don't give this to charity, you believe you have some moral obligations to strangers. You can't kill them, for instance. You can't make them suffer.

Politics is full of morality. Now, I don't want to, I don't want to overstate this. There are some political differences that people have that aren't moral. You may, you and I may share the same goal. We agree on the morality. Now we're sort of struggling with this, with the question of how to do it?

As I'm giving this lecture, the United States is currently in, the United States Congress is currently debating over whether to allow Obama to bomb Syria. Now, there's a lot of practical issues here, but a lot of those questions fundamentally moral? Is it right? To, to, to initiate bombing of another country, an act will for surely kill innocents?

Is it right to do nothing, and then let a dictator who commits acts of chemical warfare to go free, to go unpunished? And people have very different intuitions. And again, some of the intuitions are instrumental.

Instrumental meaning that we agree on the goals, we're just trying to figure how to satisfy them. But some of them are more moral. Honest to God disagreements over what the right thing is to do.

My final example of the scope and importance of morality comes from a lovely and quite weird study done in the 1930s by the American psychologist, Thorndike. Thorndike asked people different questions about different activities.

How much money would I have to pay you to do this activity? Now some, some of the activities. They were all unpleasant. But, they were different kinds of unpleasant. So, some were unpleasant just because they were painful, or degrading, or, or, or awful in some way.

How much would I have to pay you to eat a live earthworm, was one of his questions. Or here's another one. How much would I have to pay you to have one of your front teeth removed with a pair of pliers? No anesthesia. That's one of his questions. He also asks questions about moral violations. How much would he have to pay you to do something bad? And, and it's not physically painful, but they're bad. So, one of his answers was, one of his questions was, how much would I have to pay you to strangle a cat with your bare hands? Here are his answers for those two items.

I've taken his answers, he, he got answers, of course in the 1930s dollars. I've translated them, translated them into the money that you'd have to pay now. For the tooth, its an average of 74,000 dollars. For the cat, it's 164,000 dollars. Over twice as much. And that tells us something. That tells us about the pull that morality has. 

That, that it matters so much that we want to be good people. We don’t want to do this bad thing. That, that we would have to, we would rather have an experience of excruciating pain. So, that's morality as we see it.

> Adam Smith: in treating of the principles of morality, there are two questions to be considered. Wherein does virtue consist? What is the tone of temper and tenor of conduct which constitutes the excellent and praiseworthy character? The character which is the natural object of esteem, honor, and approbation.

He's asking a question. Which we would now says is a philosophical question. A normative question. How should we live? What is it to be a good person? What is it to be a virtuous person?

Or in other words, how and by what means does it come to pass that a mind prefers one tenor of conduct to another? Denominates the one right and the other wrong. Considers the one is the object of approbation on a reward and other of blame center and punishment.

But this is a different question. Now he's not asking what is the good. Now he's asking what's going on in our minds, and our brains. That causes us to say, that's good, and that's bad. That's the right way to live, and that's the wrong way to live.

And throughout this course we're going to deal with both questions. We're mostly interested in a psychological question. We're mostly interested in how people think about morality. What, what governs people's choices? What governs people's intuitions?

## 1.2: Philosophical Approaches

What is it to be good? What distinguishes good from, from evil? Right from wrong?

#### Consequentialism

- David Hume, John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham.
- Results matter. Consequences matter. You should always act in a way that's going to promote the best consequences, that's going to make the world better. What it is to do good, is to make the world better. What it is to do bad, is to make the world worse.
- Pleasure and pain. Add everything up for one option, and you add everything up for your other options. And then you choose the action that's going to produce the greatest overall amount of good.
- Bentham thinks torture is justifiable if the tortured person can set of a bomb or something which will hurt more people.
- Homosexuality, they get pleasure anyway. And these are private acts.
- Nothing was said about God. It gives up what a lot of people think is central to morality.

#### Critics of C

- It often forces us to accept as moral, things that intuitively in our gut, just awful. If torturing a child makes other people happy, then it's okay.
- There is nothing about family and friendship. If your son needs an operation to save his life, it is better to give the money to poor people to save their lives.
- It may just miss the point of morality. Cs think rape is wrong because of the suffering of the victim. But they might think that if multiple people got happy, or the victim did not feel anything, that rape is okay. This misses the point about rape or murder or torture. The point is people have a right not to be harmed. There's a wrongness to assaulting somebody, that transcends the balance of pain and pleasure.

#### Deontology

- There has to be some moral rules. Even if an action causes more pain than pleasure. 
- Immanuel Kant tried to ground his approach to morality on pure reason. He argued to forget about gut feelings and emotion.
- Hypothetical imperative: Our desires. If you want water, drink it.
- Categorical imperative: Grounded on reason. Act as if you action would become a universal law.
- Universal law: So when you decide to do, to do this versus do that. You should ask yourself, if everybody did this versus that? How would the world be? Would it demolish our way of living?
- Ex: Lying. Cs say lie only dependin on the consequence. K says you should never lie, because if everyone lied it would suck. This means you won't lie to a murderer when he asks you where his victim is.
- D theory gives you clean answers. Torture becomes wrong, even if you are able to save 100 people. So D has some sort of better moral compass than C.

#### Critics of D

- It's crazy.
- Where do the rules come from? K says reason, and critics say it's not. It's grounded on prejudices and biases. K thought homosexuality and pornography was wrong, for instance.

## 1.3: Reason vs. Emotions

- Trolley problem. Most peopel think okay to switch, but not to push the man. This means we aren't Cs. 5 > 1 in both but we don't do the same thing in both.
- Doctrine of Double Effect: There's a distinction between doing something bad, like killing or harming somebody as an unintended consequence of causing greater good to happen, and that could be the right thing to do, versus doing something bad, like killing or harming somebody in order to bring about a greater good, and that you shouldn't do. The consequences are identical. But the difference is that in one case, the bad thing is a __regrettable byproduct__. In the bad case, it's an instrument through which you act. So, this often comes up, in case, cases of just war. Or, or, or in philosophical debates and political debates over, over what's permissible in war time.
- Ex: Bomb a munitions factory to defeat the enemy, end the war, but kill the innocent workers in the factory? DoDE says that they are collateral damage. But you should do it.
- This is why we think so differently about these two cases. In the switch case, one person dies but their death is an accident and their death does nothing. In the bridge case, the person's death is necessary.
- There has been a backlash in the last decade: We should not think of people as, as these philosophical creatures doing these abstract rules, rather moral, morality is driven to a large extent by gut feelings.
- In the same way that you just know if something is disgusting or beautiful, moral judgments are rapid intuitive decisions and involve the emotional-processing parts of the brain. 
- A lot of our morality is driven by our gut.
- The idea is that if we think reason is important, we are mistaking the tail for the dog. It's, it's the motion that counts. Haidt writes, moral judge, reasoning does
not cause moral judgment; rather moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction generated after a judgment has been reached.
- David Hume talking about moral reasoning says, look, our moral decisions, our moral understanding is not driven by reason. Rather, he says, reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions.

## 1.4: The Case of Disgust

Disgust is a human universal. It shows up in every culture.  When you're disgusted by something, you don't want to touch it. You, you, you don't want to smell it, and you certainly don't want to eat it. You don't want it in your mouth.

In the extreme, something sufficiently disgusting could make you vomit, and it will, always illicit this distinctive emotion, this distinctive feeling, that we identify, as disgust.

Evolutionary psychologists, interested in emotions, have argued that this feeling evolved for a certain function. It evolved to motivate us, to avoid parasites and poisons. So you think of the things that we are disgusted by, and they share certain things in common. They could poison us, they, they have infectious properties.

But, one of the most troubling facts about disgust, is that people can be disgusting. And this was something pointed out by Charles Darwin, who was always a wonderful and acute observer of of human interaction. Whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage, though his hands did not appear dirty.

People are disgusting. Our response to strangers, our response to being touched by strangers, to, to smelling strangers and so on, is often a response of disgust. Now, there's some debate in the field as to, why people illicit disgust.

Some scholars say, people illicit disgust because people carry diseases. Strange people will carry strange diseases.

Others argue that it's not really that, rather, people are disgusting because we are fleshy things. We are made of meat. We, we, we produce feces, and urine, and other things. We, we are, we are animal like things and if you think of people in that way, you can be readily disgusted by them.

Once you are disgusted by them, it can have moral effects, it could have consequences and the consequences of being disgusted by somebody, of being disgusted by a group of people, are profoundly negative.

Every genocidal movement that, that has left a record, exhibits signs that disgust was used, to illicit hatred towards the despised group. Most movements involving prejudice and discrimination, don't just say those people, they're rotten, they're stupid, they're mean. They also say, they're disgusting.

This is an insight that the philosopher Martha Nessbaum, nicely summarizes. Throughout history, certain disgust properties, sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness, have repeatedly and monotonously been associated with Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower class people.

All of those are imagined as tainted, by the dirt of the body. and, and this is an example from Nazi propaganda. But there are, are countless such examples, where a despised group is described as, disgusting. There seems to be a natural connection to being disgusted by somebody and, not caring about them.

In fact, wanting them to suffer. Psychologists have studied disgust in the lab. And there's different ways to do it. So, one way to do it is, you can see how easily disgusted people are, and then see how much their disgust sensitivity, predicts other properties about them.

And it turns out that, that your disgust sensitivity is related to certain interesting facts about you. Women, on average, are more disgust sensitive, than men. There's evidence that women become particularly disgust sensitive, at a certain vulnerable point in pregnancy.

Political conservatives, tend to be more disgust sensitive, than political liberals. And most important for what we're talking about here, your disgust sensitivity corresponds to, certain moral attitudes. So for instance, in some, some research finds, that people who are very disgust sensitive, are more likely to be, express negative moral attitudes about homosexuals.

Turns out, being grossed out by this fart spray, doesn't influence your feelings about tax policy. And it doesn't influence your feelings about the environment or, or other things. But it does affect, how you think about groups like homosexuals.

It makes you harsher towards them. It also makes you harsher towards moral violations, you could called purity violations. Like consensual incest or or masturbation in an inappropriate place or stuff like that. If you're disgusted, you're more disapproving.

And these studies suggest that, your feelings about somebody or, or what somebody does, can be influenced by your emotional state. In particular, your emotional state of disgust. Now disgust can also influence certain specific moral judgments. So, so far I've been talking more or less about, moral feelings towards somebody. But what about judgments about, what's right and wrong?

Well, Jonathan Haidt thought up some very interesting examples. And he uses these examples to show that, even people who think, that they're very liberal and quite consequential, can be influenced in their judgments of morality, by whether or not, something disgusts them.

Examples

-  Julie and Mark are our sister and brother. They're adults, they travel together. They decide to have sex with one another. Now, they're very cognizant of worries of having pregnancy and so on, so they use tons of birth control. There's no chance, that, that, that she'll get pregnant. And they have sex and it's great. And they do it several times, and they just love it. And then they decide, they're not going to tell anybody, and and they're not going to do it again. Did Julie and Mark do something wrong?
- Family dog runs out in the street, gets hit by a car. Family brings the dog in, very sad. But then they realize, they have nothing planned for supper tonight. So they cook the dog and eat it. And it's delicious, and they're very happy.
-  The toilet is very dirty but this guy has run out of cleaning supplies, and wants to clean the toilet. Fortunately, he has an American flag. Takes the flag and uses it,
to scrub the toiler clean. Now he's happy, clean toilet. Has he done anything wrong?
-  The chicken case is, this guy goes to supermarket, he buys a chicken, he brings the chicken back home. It's not a live chicken, like a chicken, like you, from the supermarket, he makes love to the chicken, has sex with the chicken. And then he cooks it and eats it. Has he done something wrong?

I'm not asking you, whether he's done something which grosses you out. I, I imagine, you have an answer to that. Has he done anything wrong?

Now, what Haidt finds is, for these sorts of examples, he finds a couple of things. First thing is that, most people, almost everybody find so many things wrong, they find them morally wrong. The exceptions are liberal, highly liberal students from elite universities.

Some of them say no, those are all okay, no one's harmed. But most people, almost everybody, find them wrong. But he also finds, that people are, not usually able to explain, what they find, wrong about them. And he calls this, moral dumbfounding.

Incest: No chance to get pregnant. Other people will not find out. People struggle to find an explanation why they think it is wrong.  Rather, their reaction is because these things disgust them. And because they're disgusting, they're found to be immoral. And if he's right, this would be a case where, our emotions and not our reason, are driving moral judgment.

## 1.5: Cute and Sexy

Our gut feelings can be positive towards somebody. Babies: Very easy to feel fondly towards, that will elicit a desire to protect. It's because it's adorable, because, because of the big eyes and the round cheeks and these sort of cues that we've been wired up to respond to.

And, and, and our, the effects of these cues and how we feel towards people and how we feel towards creatures has, has real effects. Here are two animals. Now, I actually don't have a strong opinion as to which animal is smarter, which animal has a richer emotional life. Which animal feels more pain.

But, what's not a hard question is I know which animal people care about more. One animal we bring into our houses, and we we, we give treats to, and we hold birthday parties for, and we love. And, the other kind of animal we eat. And this does not have to do with the features of the animal.

It has to do with, with how they look. Kittens are cute. Pigs are not. There are other distinctions one could make, more subtle distinctions one could make, concerning sort of positive responses.

And their effects on moral reasoning. So, one research program I've been interested in is, concerns the effects of looking at people's bodies, and to what extent does looking at people's bodies affect how you judge them and think about them morally.

It turns out that when you see somebody's body, it has two effects on your reasoning about them. One is, you actually, in some way, care more about them. You think that they're more vulnerable to pain. You think they're more sensitive to, to, to, to being hurt. You worry a little bit more about them. But you also tend to deny them moral agency.

What I mean by this is that, for most of us, when you look at somebody, you say, well, there's a person that could be blamed, they could be praised, they're responsible for their own actions, they make their own decisions. But when you see somebody's body, that tendency to think of them as an agent goes down a bit. 

Now this, these pictures, the difference I'm showing you here is fairly subtle. And we thought in our experiments we'd be stuck with those sort of subtle distinctions until we found this wonderful book (30 Porn Star Portraits). And this book has photographs, side by side, of the very same men and women. But, in one picture, they're fully dressed. And in the other pictures, they're entirely naked.

We found that when people are naked, you tend, in some way, to be more concerned about them. But also, you tend to deny them moral agency. It really matters. There's something, there's some real psychological truth to the claim made by feminist scholars, that the objectification of women, thinking of women as sexual beings, as physical beings, has an effect, perhaps a pernicious effect on how you think about them and what we find in this work is, it applies to men as well as women.

If you did, you should put these two books together on your shelves separately and then people will look at them and they will wonder what kind of person you are. So, why do naked people, why do bodies, have this sort of effect on us?

One explanation is, that, they inspire lust. And lust somehow blocks certain morals. Sentiment makes you think about a person a different way. Another possibility, that is sort of separate from lust, is that if you see somebody without clothes. They're more like an animal, they lose their dignity. They lose their status. And it's that which is driving the effect.

And we actually, in our research, we don't know the answer to that. But we do know, from other work, that the feeling of lust, the feeling of sexual arousal can have an affect on your moral decision making.

Dan Ariely experiment (the masturbating thing): So you could ask people whether or not they could imagine being attracted to a 12-year-old girl. And it turns out if people were non-aroused, like, you know, a quarter say yeah. But when they're aroused, it doubles. Or or becoming sexually excited, by an animal.

The most disturbing findings involved a sort of date rapey, questions. Would you slip a woman a drug to increase the chances that she would have sex with you? When men were not aroused, 5% said yes. But this number got much, much bigger when they were aroused.

I, it tells people, that your psychology changes when you're aroused. You're no longer the same person in an important sense. Your sense of what turns you on when you're aroused is different from when you're not aroused. And it's yet another argument that our morality can be influenced by not just by reason, but by the emotions.

## 1.6: Returning to the Trolley

We said this might be because people have this abstract philosophical principle that sees, sort of, a subtle difference between these two, and for instance, the principle we talked about was, in the switch case, the guy dying is an accident, doesn't do any good.

In the bridge case the guy dying is essential. He's an instrument through which to bring about the good. And this was the analysis we had. But there's an alternative. This alternative was proposed by Joshua Green and has a lot of support. The alternative says, that's not what's happening at all.

And what he did was, he had people solve trolley problems, like reasonsabout moral problems, while they were hooked up to an fMRI. He found that the switch case activated parts of the brain in the frontal cortex, the part of the brain that's up front here. And these are parts of the brain that are typically involved concious deliberative reasoning. And these parts of the brains would be active and people would make their choice. And often their choice would be, yeah they should throw the switch, that makes sense. Five lives matter more than one life.

What about, the bridge case? Well here the same part of the brain, was active. Presumably doing the calculations of, five versus one. But also, various other parts of the brain that are involved in conflict and emotion, emotional feelings, light up stronger. And, for these sorts of cases, people say that you shouldn't push the man.

The way Green analyzes this is, it's not that there's some sort of subtle philosophical principle that governs the difference between the switch case and the bridge case. Rather, 

there's sort of two aspects of our moral psychology. There's controlled rational processes. And the controlled rational processes are, under Green's view, largely utilitarian. They just calculate consequences in a very cold-blooded way. But there's also automatic, involuntary, gut feelings.

And so what Green says is, for the switch case you just map. You, and so you have choosing you have one life and five lives to control process, chug away. And you typically say well, you know, better to save five. Even at the expense of one. But for the bridge case, emotions light up. It's not just a cold blooded calculation one and five, but also this gut feeling. And the gut feeling lights up for green. Not because of any principle or structure. It's, it's the idea that this visceral feeling of putting your hands on somebody and shoving, causes emotional response. That's what's driving it.

It has nothing to do with the doctrine of double effect, or anything like that. It's an emotional response to the physicality of pushing somebody to his death.

We also know from other research that people can be influenced in their choices on the switch case and a bridge case by fiddling with their emotions in various ways. So my favorite example of this is, how do you make people more likely to say it's okay to push the man off the bridge? 

Show them something funny.

So they, so, the researchers found some very funny clips from Saturday Night Live, they showed em to people, people laughed, and then they asked bridge case. And they said, now people said, yeah, I'll push em. Suggesting that there, that, that there aren't these abstract emotion, sorry, the abstract rational principles guiding our choices here, but rather, gut feelings played more of a role.

## 1.7: The Big Questions

Is Hume right? Is, is, is really more reasoning just a slave of the passions? What's the proper relationship between emotion and reason in everyday moral life? Is everything emotional? Does reason play any important role?

Emotion plainly affects our morality. But I want to try also persuade you that reason, cold blooded rational deliberation, thinking things through also affects our moral lives.

Second big question is where do morals come from? So, how much of our moral judgments we've
been talking about, are intuitions about trolley problems and murder and rape and, and masturbation and selling your body organs and eating dogs and so on?

How much of this is explained by evolution, so part of our brain structured by our, our evolutionary history, how much of it is explained by personal, individual experience, how much varies from culture to culture, and how much of it is just personal choice?

And then the third question, the big question maybe, is can scientific inquiry - including psychological inquiry - help us with morality? Can it help us be better people?

Some people say it is a fallacy to go from the way the world is, which is what science studies, to the way the world ought to be, which is the proper domain of ethics. But things might be more complicated than that, and we're going to struggle with these questions, throughout.

And for the reading, for the assignments for this week you're supposed to watch their TED talks where they present their view in detail. What I want to do here is, as a way to introduce it, present a snippet from each of their talks.

And what I like about, about this is they're each articulate proponents of a perspective on morality, but the perspectives are quite different. They are, they are, are as close to opposites as you could find. 

Sam Harris argues there's object the facts about the moral landscape. And it, what makes it a moral landscape is, the space has hills where, where things are good, and valleys where things are bad. And there are objective facts. And he argues that many popular moral (mostly religious) views - are just wrong. They're as wrong about morality as they are about, you know, cosmology.

>> When talking about morality, we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives. The Dalai Lama thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness. Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young So we appear to have a genuine difference
of opinion about how to profitably use
one's time.

>> Most western intellectuals look at this situation and say, well there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about, really right about. Or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about. That admits of a, of a real argument. That, that, that, that potentially falls within the purview of science.

> Well, you know, that he's like chocolate, he likes vanilla there's, there's no, there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other, that should persuade the other.

> Now notice that we don't do this in science. Whenever we are talking about facts, certain opinions must be excluded. Then, that is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. 

> How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere, there is no such thing as moral expertise? Or moral talent? Or moral genius, even? How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count? How have we convinced ourselves that, that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering? Does, does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No.

> How, how is there ignorance, how is their ignorance, how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being?

> So, so this I, I think is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing. And morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible, for individuals, and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things. Just admitting this, will transform our discourse about morality.

> We live in a world in which, the boundaries between nations mean less and less, and they will one day mean nothing. We live in a world filled with destructive technology, and this technology cannot be uninvented. It, it will always be easier to break things than to fix them.

> It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more, respect and tolerate vast differences in, in notions of human well being than we can respect or tolerate vast difference in the notions about how disease spreads. Or in the, in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.

> And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers. Thank you very much.

So Jonathan Haidt in contrast has a very different perspective. Haidt emphasizes a respect for pluralism. In particular, he argues that many moral frameworks including common ones that are grounded in religion, deserve respect.

> You have the markings of, of Vishnu on the left, so we could think of Vishnu as the
conservative god. You have the markings of Shiva, on the right. Shiva is the liberal god, and they work together.

> You find the same thing in Buddhism. These two stanzas contain I think the deepest insights that have ever been attained, into moral psychology.

> "From the Zen master Seng-ts'an. If you want the trust to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease."

> Well, if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology, I think you'd come to these conclusions. That our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams, and then to blind us to the truth.

> So, what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive? Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop?  No, absolutely not. I'm not saying that. This is an amazing group of people, who are doing so much, using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money to make the world a better place, to fight, to fight wrongs to, to solve problems. But as you can't just go charging in, saying you're wrong and I'm right. because as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.

> A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require to change other people. And if you want to change other people, the much better way to do it is to first understand who we are. Understand our moral psychology, understand that we all think we're right, and then step out. Step out of the moral matrix, just try to see it as, as a struggle playing out in which everybody does think they're right. And everybody at least has some reasons, even if you disagree with them, everybody has some reasons for what they're doing.

But what again, what I hope to do is, as we talk more and more about the science of morality, talk more about theories, talk more about data. We'll be in a better position, all of us, to better decide, what's the right answer to these big and these very important questions.

## Readings 1.1: The Moral Instinct, Steven Pinker

For most people, Mother Theresea > Bill Gates > Norman Borlaug for who is most admirable. But Borlaug used the agriculture revolution and is credited with saving a billion lives, Gates fights against malaria and diarrhea, and Mother Teresa's patrons were offered prayer but harsh conditions and primitive medical care.

Our heads can be turned by an aura of sanctity, distracting us from a more objective recokning of the actions that make people suffer or flourish.

#### The Moralization Switch

Moralization is a psychological state that can be turned on and off like a switch, and when it is on, a distinctive mind-set commandeers our thinking. This is the mind-set that makes us deem actions immoral (“killing is wrong”), rather than merely disagreeable (“I hate brussels sprouts”), unfashionable (“bell-bottoms are out”) or imprudent (“don’t scratch mosquito bites”).

The rules it invokes are felt to be universal. Prohibiting rape/murder is universal, while hating brussel sprouts is not.

People feel that those who commit immoral acts desever to be punished. "They can't get away with it." "The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists — that is why they invented hell." - Bertrand Russell

Moral vegetarians are more likely to treat meat as a contaminant as opposed to health vegetarians. They are more likely to think that other people ought to be vegetarians, more likely to imbue their dietary habits with other virtues, like believing that meat avoidance makes people less aggressive and bestial.

Much of our recent social history, including the culture wars between liberals and conservatives, consists of the moralization or amoralization of particular kinds of behavior. Even when people agree that an outcome is desirable, they may disagree on whether it should be treated as a matter of preference and prudence or as a matter of sin and virtue. When secondhand smoke was discovered, smoking is now treated as immoral: images of people smoking are censored and entities touched by smoke are felt to be contaminated.

At the same time, many behaviors have been amoralized: divorce, illegitimacy, being a working mother, marijuana use and homosexuality. Many afflictions have been reassigned from payback for bad choices to unlucky misfortunes. There used to be people called “bums” and “tramps”; today they are “homeless.” Drug addiction is a “disease”; syphilis was rebranded from the price of wanton behavior to a “sexually transmitted disease” and more recently a “sexually transmitted infection.”

This wave of amoralization has led the cultural right to lament that morality itself is under assault, as we see in the group that anointed itself the Moral Majority. In fact there seems to be a Law of Conservation of Moralization, so that as old behaviors are taken out of the moralized column, new ones are added to it. Dozens of things that past generations treated as practical matters are now ethical battlegrounds, including disposable diapers, I.Q. tests, poultry farms, Barbie dolls and research on breast cancer. Food alone has become a minefield, with critics sermonizing about the size of sodas, the chemistry of fat, the freedom of chickens, the price of coffee beans, the species of fish and now the distance the food has traveled from farm to plate.

Many of these moralizations, like the assault on smoking, may be understood as practical tactics to reduce some recently identified harm. But whether an activity flips our mental switches to the “moral” setting isn’t just a matter of how much harm it does. We don’t show contempt to the man who fails to change the batteries in his smoke alarms or takes his family on a driving vacation, both of which multiply the risk they will die in an accident. Driving a gas-guzzling Hummer is reprehensible, but driving a gas-guzzling old Volvo is not; eating a Big Mac is unconscionable, but not imported cheese or crème brûlée. The reason for these double standards is obvious: people tend to align their moralization with their own lifestyles.

#### A Universal Morality?

The stirrings of morality emerge early in childhood. Toddlers spontaneously offer toys and help to others and try to comfort people they see in distress. And according to the psychologists Elliot Turiel and Judith Smetana, preschoolers have an inkling of the difference between societal conventions and moral principles. Four-year-olds say that it is not O.K. to wear pajamas to school (a convention) and also not O.K. to hit a little girl for no reason (a moral principle). But when asked whether these actions would be O.K. if the teacher allowed them, most of the children said that wearing pajamas would now be fine but that hitting a little girl would still not be.

Though no one has identified genes for morality, there is circumstantial evidence they exist. The character traits called “conscientiousness” and “agreeableness” are far more correlated in identical twins separated at birth (who share their genes but not their environment) than in adoptive siblings raised together (who share their environment but not their genes). People given diagnoses of “antisocial personality disorder” or “psychopathy” show signs of morality blindness from the time they are children. They bully younger children, torture animals, habitually lie and seem incapable of empathy or remorse, often despite normal family backgrounds. Some of these children grow up into the monsters who bilk elderly people out of their savings, rape a succession of women or shoot convenience-store clerks lying on the floor during a robbery.

Though psychopathy probably comes from a genetic predisposition, a milder version can be caused by damage to frontal regions of the brain (including the areas that inhibit intact people from throwing the hypothetical fat man off the bridge). The neuroscientists Hanna and Antonio Damasio and their colleagues found that some children who sustain severe injuries to their frontal lobes can grow up into callous and irresponsible adults, despite normal intelligence. They lie, steal, ignore punishment, endanger their own children and can’t think through even the simplest moral dilemmas, like what two people should do if they disagreed on which TV channel to watch or whether a man ought to steal a drug to save his dying wife.

#### The Varieties of Moral Experience

The exact number of themes depends on whether you’re a lumper or a splitter, but Haidt counts five — harm, fairness, community (or group loyalty), authority and purity — and suggests that they are the primary colors of our moral sense. Not only do they keep reappearing in cross-cultural surveys, but each one tugs on the moral intuitions of people in our own culture. Haidt asks us to consider how much money someone would have to pay us to do hypothetical acts like the following:

Stick a pin into your palm.

Stick a pin into the palm of a child you don’t know. (Harm.)

Accept a wide-screen TV from a friend who received it at no charge because of a computer error.

Accept a wide-screen TV from a friend who received it from a thief who had stolen it from a wealthy family. (Fairness.)

Say something bad about your nation (which you don’t believe) on a talk-radio show in your nation.

Say something bad about your nation (which you don’t believe) on a talk-radio show in a foreign nation. (Community.)

Slap a friend in the face, with his permission, as part of a comedy skit.

Slap your minister in the face, with his permission, as part of a comedy skit. (Authority.)

Attend a performance-art piece in which the actors act like idiots for 30 minutes, including flubbing simple problems and falling down on stage.

Attend a performance-art piece in which the actors act like animals for 30 minutes, including crawling around naked and urinating on stage. (Purity.)

In each pair, the second action feels far more repugnant. Most of the moral illusions we have visited come from an unwarranted intrusion of one of the moral spheres into our judgments. A violation of community led people to frown on using an old flag to clean a bathroom. Violations of purity repelled the people who judged the morality of consensual incest and prevented the moral vegetarians and nonsmokers from tolerating the slightest trace of a vile contaminant. At the other end of the scale, displays of extreme purity lead people to venerate religious leaders who dress in white and affect an aura of chastity and asceticism.

#### The Genealogy of Morals

The five spheres are good candidates for a periodic table of the moral sense not only because they are ubiquitous but also because they appear to have deep evolutionary roots. The impulse to avoid harm, which gives trolley ponderers the willies when they consider throwing a man off a bridge, can also be found in rhesus monkeys, who go hungry rather than pull a chain that delivers food to them and a shock to another monkey. Respect for authority is clearly related to the pecking orders of dominance and appeasement that are widespread in the animal kingdom. The purity-defilement contrast taps the emotion of disgust that is triggered by potential disease vectors like bodily effluvia, decaying flesh and unconventional forms of meat, and by risky sexual practices like incest.

The other two moralized spheres match up with the classic examples of how altruism can evolve that were worked out by sociobiologists in the 1960s and 1970s and made famous by Richard Dawkins in his book “The Selfish Gene.” Fairness is very close to what scientists call reciprocal altruism, where a willingness to be nice to others can evolve as long as the favor helps the recipient more than it costs the giver and the recipient returns the favor when fortunes reverse. The analysis makes it sound as if reciprocal altruism comes out of a robotlike calculation, but in fact Robert Trivers, the biologist who devised the theory, argued that it is implemented in the brain as a suite of moral emotions. Sympathy prompts a person to offer the first favor, particularly to someone in need for whom it would go the furthest. Anger protects a person against cheaters who accept a favor without reciprocating, by impelling him to punish the ingrate or sever the relationship. Gratitude impels a beneficiary to reward those who helped him in the past. Guilt prompts a cheater in danger of being found out to repair the relationship by redressing the misdeed and advertising that he will behave better in the future (consistent with Mencken’s definition of conscience as “the inner voice which warns us that someone might be looking”). Many experiments on who helps whom, who likes whom, who punishes whom and who feels guilty about what have confirmed these predictions.

Community, the very different emotion that prompts people to share and sacrifice without an expectation of payback, may be rooted in nepotistic altruism, the empathy and solidarity we feel toward our relatives (and which evolved because any gene that pushed an organism to aid a relative would have helped copies of itself sitting inside that relative). In humans, of course, communal feelings can be lavished on nonrelatives as well. Sometimes it pays people (in an evolutionary sense) to love their companions because their interests are yoked, like spouses with common children, in-laws with common relatives, friends with common tastes or allies with common enemies. And sometimes it doesn’t pay them at all, but their kinship-detectors have been tricked into treating their groupmates as if they were relatives by tactics like kinship metaphors (blood brothers, fraternities, the fatherland), origin myths, communal meals and other bonding rituals.

#### Juggling the Spheres

America - harm and fairness. Japan - community (fear of nonconfromity). Hindus/Jews - purity (dietary restrictions). Muslims - authority (insulting the prophet.) West hates nepotism/cronyism, but in other parts of the world, family is more important than strangers.

#### Is Nothing Sacred?

And “morally corrosive” is exactly the term that some critics would apply to the new science of the moral sense. The attempt to dissect our moral intuitions can look like an attempt to debunk them. In reality, none of these fears are warranted, and it’s important to see why not. 

“Selfish” genes are perfectly compatible with selfless organisms, because a gene’s metaphorical goal of selfishly replicating itself can be implemented by wiring up the brain of the organism to do unselfish things, like being nice to relatives or doing good deeds for needy strangers.

Nor does reciprocal altruism — the evolutionary rationale behind fairness — imply that people do good deeds in the cynical expectation of repayment down the line.

In his classic 1971 article, Trivers, the biologist, showed how natural selection could push in the direction of true selflessness. The emergence of tit-for-tat reciprocity, which lets organisms trade favors without being cheated, is just a first step. A favor-giver not only has to avoid blatant cheaters (those who would accept a favor but not return it) but also prefer generous reciprocators (those who return the biggest favor they can afford) over stingy ones (those who return the smallest favor they can get away with). Since it’s good to be chosen as a recipient of favors, a competition arises to be the most generous partner around. More accurately, a competition arises to appear to be the most generous partner around, since the favor-giver can’t literally read minds or see into the future. A reputation for fairness and generosity becomes an asset.

Now this just sets up a competition for potential beneficiaries to inflate their reputations without making the sacrifices to back them up. But it also pressures the favor-giver to develop ever-more-sensitive radar to distinguish the genuinely generous partners from the hypocrites. This arms race will eventually reach a logical conclusion. The most effective way to seem generous and fair, under harsh scrutiny, is to be generous and fair. In the long run, then, reputation can be secured only by commitment. At least some agents evolve to be genuinely high-minded and self-sacrificing — they are moral not because of what it brings them but because that’s the kind of people they are.

Of course, a theory that predicted that everyone always sacrificed themselves for another’s good would be as preposterous as a theory that predicted that no one ever did. Alongside the niches for saints there are niches for more grudging reciprocators, who attract fewer and poorer partners but don’t make the sacrifices necessary for a sterling reputation. And both may coexist with outright cheaters, who exploit the unwary in one-shot encounters. An ecosystem of niches, each with a distinct strategy, can evolve when the payoff of each strategy depends on how many players are playing the other strategies. The human social environment does have its share of generous, grudging and crooked characters, and the genetic variation in personality seems to bear the fingerprints of this evolutionary process.

#### Is Morality a Figment?

So a biological understanding of the moral sense does not entail that people are calculating maximizers of their genes or self-interest. But where does it leave the concept of morality itself?

Here is the worry. The scientific outlook has taught us that some parts of our subjective experience are products of our biological makeup and have no objective counterpart in the world. The qualitative difference between red and green, the tastiness of fruit and foulness of carrion, the scariness of heights and prettiness of flowers are design features of our common nervous system, and if our species had evolved in a different ecosystem or if we were missing a few genes, our reactions could go the other way. Now, if the distinction between right and wrong is also a product of brain wiring, why should we believe it is any more real than the distinction between red and green? And if it is just a collective hallucination, how could we argue that evils like genocide and slavery are wrong for everyone, rather than just distasteful to us?

Putting God in charge of morality is one way to solve the problem, of course, but Plato made short work of it 2,400 years ago. Does God have a good reason for designating certain acts as moral and others as immoral? If not — if his dictates are divine whims — why should we take them seriously? Suppose that God commanded us to torture a child. Would that make it all right, or would some other standard give us reasons to resist? And if, on the other hand, God was forced by moral reasons to issue some dictates and not others — if a command to torture a child was never an option — then why not appeal to those reasons directly?

This throws us back to wondering where those reasons could come from, if they are more than just figments of our brains. They certainly aren’t in the physical world like wavelength or mass. The only other option is that moral truths exist in some abstract Platonic realm, there for us to discover, perhaps in the same way that mathematical truths (according to most mathematicians) are there for us to discover. On this analogy, we are born with a rudimentary concept of number, but as soon as we build on it with formal mathematical reasoning, the nature of mathematical reality forces us to discover some truths and not others. (No one who understands the concept of two, the concept of four and the concept of addition can come to any conclusion but that 2 + 2 = 4.) Perhaps we are born with a rudimentary moral sense, and as soon as we build on it with moral reasoning, the nature of moral reality forces us to some conclusions but not others.

Moral realism, as this idea is called, is too rich for many philosophers’ blood. Yet a diluted version of the idea — if not a list of cosmically inscribed Thou-Shalts, then at least a few If-Thens — is not crazy. Two features of reality point any rational, self-preserving social agent in a moral direction. And they could provide a benchmark for determining when the judgments of our moral sense are aligned with morality itself.

One is the prevalence of nonzero-sum games. In many arenas of life, two parties are objectively better off if they both act in a nonselfish way than if each of them acts selfishly. You and I are both better off if we share our surpluses, rescue each other’s children in danger and refrain from shooting at each other, compared with hoarding our surpluses while they rot, letting the other’s child drown while we file our nails or feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys. Granted, I might be a bit better off if I acted selfishly at your expense and you played the sucker, but the same is true for you with me, so if each of us tried for these advantages, we’d both end up worse off. Any neutral observer, and you and I if we could talk it over rationally, would have to conclude that the state we should aim for is the one in which we both are unselfish. These spreadsheet projections are not quirks of brain wiring, nor are they dictated by a supernatural power; they are in the nature of things.

The other external support for morality is a feature of rationality itself: that it cannot depend on the egocentric vantage point of the reasoner. If I appeal to you to do anything that affects me — to get off my foot, or tell me the time or not run me over with your car — then I can’t do it in a way that privileges my interests over yours (say, retaining my right to run you over with my car) if I want you to take me seriously. Unless I am Galactic Overlord, I have to state my case in a way that would force me to treat you in kind. I can’t act as if my interests are special just because I’m me and you’re not, any more than I can persuade you that the spot I am standing on is a special place in the universe just because I happen to be standing on it.

Not coincidentally, the core of this idea — the interchangeability of perspectives — keeps reappearing in history’s best-thought-through moral philosophies, including the Golden Rule (itself discovered many times); Spinoza’s Viewpoint of Eternity; the Social Contract of Hobbes, Rousseau and Locke; Kant’s Categorical Imperative; and Rawls’s Veil of Ignorance. It also underlies Peter Singer’s theory of the Expanding Circle — the optimistic proposal that our moral sense, though shaped by evolution to overvalue self, kin and clan, can propel us on a path of moral progress, as our reasoning forces us to generalize it to larger and larger circles of sentient beings.

Doing Better by Knowing Ourselves

Morality, then, is still something larger than our inherited moral sense, and the new science of the moral sense does not make moral reasoning and conviction obsolete. At the same time, its implications for our moral universe are profound.

At the very least, the science tells us that even when our adversaries’ agenda is most baffling, they may not be amoral psychopaths but in the throes of a moral mind-set that appears to them to be every bit as mandatory and universal as ours does to us. Of course, some adversaries really are psychopaths, and others are so poisoned by a punitive moralization that they are beyond the pale of reason. (The actor Will Smith had many historians on his side when he recently speculated to the press that Hitler thought he was acting morally.) But in any conflict in which a meeting of the minds is not completely hopeless, a recognition that the other guy is acting from moral rather than venal reasons can be a first patch of common ground. One side can acknowledge the other’s concern for community or stability or fairness or dignity, even while arguing that some other value should trump it in that instance. With affirmative action, for example, the opponents can be seen as arguing from a sense of fairness, not racism, and the defenders can be seen as acting from a concern with community, not bureaucratic power. Liberals can ratify conservatives’ concern with families while noting that gay marriage is perfectly consistent with that concern.

The science of the moral sense also alerts us to ways in which our psychological makeup can get in the way of our arriving at the most defensible moral conclusions. The moral sense, we are learning, is as vulnerable to illusions as the other senses. It is apt to confuse morality per se with purity, status and conformity. It tends to reframe practical problems as moral crusades and thus see their solution in punitive aggression. It imposes taboos that make certain ideas indiscussible. And it has the nasty habit of always putting the self on the side of the angels.

Though wise people have long reflected on how we can be blinded by our own sanctimony, our public discourse still fails to discount it appropriately. In the worst cases, the thoughtlessness of our brute intuitions can be celebrated as a virtue. In his influential essay “The Wisdom of Repugnance,” Leon Kass, former chair of the President’s Council on Bioethics, argued that we should disregard reason when it comes to cloning and other biomedical technologies and go with our gut: “We are repelled by the prospect of cloning human beings . . . because we intuit and feel, immediately and without argument, the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear. . . . In this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done . . . repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity. Shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder.”

There are, of course, good reasons to regulate human cloning, but the shudder test is not one of them. People have shuddered at all kinds of morally irrelevant violations of purity in their culture: touching an untouchable, drinking from the same water fountain as a Negro, allowing Jewish blood to mix with Aryan blood, tolerating sodomy between consenting men. And if our ancestors’ repugnance had carried the day, we never would have had autopsies, vaccinations, blood transfusions, artificial insemination, organ transplants and in vitro fertilization, all of which were denounced as immoral when they were new.

There are many other issues for which we are too quick to hit the moralization button and look for villains rather than bug fixes. What should we do when a hospital patient is killed by a nurse who administers the wrong drug in a patient’s intravenous line? Should we make it easier to sue the hospital for damages? Or should we redesign the IV fittings so that it’s physically impossible to connect the wrong bottle to the line?

And nowhere is moralization more of a hazard than in our greatest global challenge. The threat of human-induced climate change has become the occasion for a moralistic revival meeting. In many discussions, the cause of climate change is overindulgence (too many S.U.V.’s) and defilement (sullying the atmosphere), and the solution is temperance (conservation) and expiation (buying carbon offset coupons). Yet the experts agree that these numbers don’t add up: even if every last American became conscientious about his or her carbon emissions, the effects on climate change would be trifling, if for no other reason than that two billion Indians and Chinese are unlikely to copy our born-again abstemiousness. Though voluntary conservation may be one wedge in an effective carbon-reduction pie, the other wedges will have to be morally boring, like a carbon tax and new energy technologies, or even taboo, like nuclear power and deliberate manipulation of the ocean and atmosphere. Our habit of moralizing problems, merging them with intuitions of purity and contamination, and resting content when we feel the right feelings, can get in the way of doing the right thing.

Far from debunking morality, then, the science of the moral sense can advance it, by allowing us to see through the illusions that evolution and culture have saddled us with and to focus on goals we can share and defend. As Anton Chekhov wrote, “Man will become better when you show him what he is like.”

## Week 1 Office Hours

I'm actually personal friends with both of them. They both blurbed my book, Just Babies. And I have sympathies intellectual sympathies to different extents with, with both of them. But it's fair to say that, that is Harris that generates the most heat, because Harris is very explicit.

His view is, that some, the way some religions do it, actually the way all religions do it, possible exception of Buddhism, and the way some cultures do it, live their lives, treat people is just wrong. And when you say that kind of thing, it's going to generate some heat. It is, it is, nobody likes to hear that, the way you do in your country is morally wrong and morally mistaken in how you're living your lives. So I'm not surprised that people are, are bothered by Harris. Why, perhaps offended by Harris. I, I I don't mind it. I think it shows people are, I think, I think people if you have certain issues you should be offended by Harris. But, he's a smart enough scholar and, and, and is gifted at clearly articulating an interesting and important view, that I had to include him. And I'm very happy I did.

Harris is very clearly a consequentalist, a utilitarian actually. He argues that there's a landscape of pain and pleasure. __And that you judge a society by how well it, it, it, it places people on that landscape.__ How it maximizes happiness. In some way, Sam Harris is the most purest incarnation of Jeremy Bentham. However, Harris's style of argument is certainty. Is is sort of declarative and, and argumentative style. You could easily strike somebody as almost Contian, as almost categorical. Drawing sharp lines and so on and that is how he, he makes his arguments. It's how it's, it, it's, it's his rhetorical style but he's pure consequentialist. 

So when Harris says, you guys where, where guys could be Christians. Or Muslims. He says you guys are doing it wrong. What he means is, you're not violating some abstract principle. Rather, you're moral rules are causing suffering. The way you're living your life causes suffering. Causes pain without the accompaniment of pleasure. Does not allow people to flourish. Doesn't allow people to fulfill their lives. And that's consequentialism through and through.

So we'll be reading more, more of Haidt in the course. We'll be reading a chapter, a chapter of his on politics. And Haidt is definitely more pluralist than Harris. Haidt thinks there are many ways to build a moral life here, many different moral values to be maximized, not all of them being consequentialist. And he has more respect for them. He has more respect for a society that tries to maximize values like community purity, divinity, all things that Harris has very little patience for. So he's a pluralist. 

But it's not correct I think to say that, that for Haidt everything goes. In particular, Haidt would say some moral views are just flat wrong. The views he respects, are those that have a long history. And his logic, I think, is that if there's been a moral view that's been around for a long time, centuries, the view has in some way proven itself worthy of respect. It proves that you would have if it's, we're going to flourish in society over hundreds, maybe thousands of years, Haidt's intuition is this is doing something for them and, and we should show some respect for that view. It's fundamentally a conservative argument, I think its a good conservative argument which is, you shouldn't be so quick to reject things that have been around for a long time, because the fact that they have been around for a long time might suggest that they have more utility. 

I think that virtue ethicists have a good point when they say, you know, we should focus instead on how to live one's life. What sort of moral character we should be. so, so it might be a wrong turn. To just put so much focus on what would you do if there's a runaway trolley and there's this and there's that and you can do this and that because in some way that is part of morality. But another part of morality is how to be a good mother, a good father, a good, good son, good daughter, good friend, a good colleague. Not in terms of, sort of, this dilemma, should you do X or Y? And to some extent I think it's because certainly as psychologists, we love boiling things down to, sort of, things where you say, okay what's the right answer, this or this. Then we test 1,000 people and we do statistics and everything like that. 

But what if morality isn't best appreciated that way. What if morality isn't a series of dilemmas or problems but more sort of a way of the kind of person you are and how you live your life. What it is to be a good friend can't be broken down into sort of a series of, do you do this or that, do you do this or that. You know it's, it's, it's not that kind of thing. It's, it's how you deal with people. How you, how you, you, you spend your time. How you, how you think about things. 

If I'm standing near a trolley and, you know, something's going to happen. Some people are going to be killed. Maybe the right thing to do is just not to do anything, because then I won't be responsible for some of the deaths. For any deaths. What do you think about that answer? What do you think of that answer? What would you do? So, so what do you think the right answer is? If not the, not the man on the bridge, but there's a, a runaway trolley and there's a switch, and if, if you throw the switch, it will get diverted from the five, and kill one person. Not asking now what the right thing to do is, what do you think you would do? 

But psychologically there's a big difference between an act and an omission and were not typically held as responsible for omissions. If I live in a big city and there's a homeless person in front of my building and I do nothing to help them and then they, they starve to death or they freeze in the winter. Did I kill them? Well, we're not abs, I, the police won't come to me and arrest me for murder. If I went down and hit him on the head with a hammer, then they'd arrest me. So we have this huge sense of an act versus an omission and this is very different from con, consequentialists say it shouldn't matter. 
But it does matter. And so I, I, I, I understand where it's coming from, the feeling you should do nothing. Because if you do nothing you have clean hands in a certain way. While as soon as you do something, you're responsible for the death that your act would cause. I think moral philosophers like Bentham or Peter Singer who we'll talk about in this week coming up would say that's mistaken, but it feels right. And so I have some sort of appreciation for it. 

And I'm absolutely fascinated by disgust and it's moral effects and so that question's thought of a lot. And, I think the answer is yes. And I think the answer is yes in an everyday sense of disgust. So, take a new parent and a baby and you have to clean up it's, it's diaper or it's vomit and everything. Which new parents spend most of their time doing. And at first it's really gross, but you get used to it. You just get used to it. You, you, it doesn't bother you as much. You learn to, you learn to not focus on it. I would change my kids' diapers and after a while it wouldn't bother me at all. So, I could, could figure out how to do it. I never changed another kid's diaper. I tried it it's awful. But you know you get, you get used to it. And I think it's the same thing for I know we have people who posted, we have some nurses who posted, talking about how you, you get, you get used to it. 

But there's, there's also, I think, a more interesting answer which is I think to some extent other emotions conquer disgust. So there's a literature on, on lust, so so, so I'm not, don't worry, I'm not going to get graphic, but there's, but, but, people who are in sexual passion will often do things and engage in things that would be disgusting if they weren't. 

There's also love. I think that the, the, the treatment you give to your child, to an elderly parent, to a sick friend. If you love somebody, they cease to be disgusting to you. And this is why you have these stories of these saints. Who, who do engage in acts that, that, that would seem to be disgusting to many. And I think that these are meant to illustrate that these saints are filled with infinite love, even to strangers. Great. 

So Kant argues that you should never use never treat people as a means to an end, but always treat them as an end in them, in themselves. Doesn't psychology research treat people as a means? 

Yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's true and, and I think some people are a little bit upset at this or a lot upset at this. So, there are some experiments including experiments we're going to talk about later on in the course that are, that we would never nowadays. They were done 20, 30, 40 years ago. And they are unethical. They're unethical because they they don't take people's dignity and consent into account because they, they do cruel deceptions and so on. I think we've learned a lot from them, but I think on balance we shouldn't have done them. 

The best interpretation of Kant I think, is that people shouldn't be only a means. That although we might interact with them. We might interact with them from the standpoint of, of getting something from them, getting from this place to that place, getting a meal, buying a product. We should also acknowledge that they're people and treat them with respect and, and, and, and with appreciation for the fact that they're people. 

And so, as a psychologist, I try to do that as well. So, when I do an experiment with an adult, I try to get the adult's consent. I don't want any unnecessary deception. When the experiment is over I, I, I explain to them what we did and so on. And and so in that way I think we, we avoid that worry. 

# Week 2

## 2.1: Caring About Others

Now empathy is often regarded as the source of compassion or source of all morality. And we'll evaluate that claim looking at what empathy is, how it works? What it could do for us? And what it can't do for us? Now, as a starting point, I want you to imagine a perfect psychopath. We are going to real psychopaths pretty soon, but now talk about an imaginary psychopath. 

#### Imaginary Psychopath

This imaginary psychopath is highly intelligent, has a normal set of emotions and desires, but totally lacks compassion, totally lacks fellow feeling. Other people do not matter to him. So, although he's not a sadist, when he wants something he'll try to get it, without any regard for other people's feelings. If he wants money or sex or power, he'll just try to get it, and he doesn't care who he hurts along the way. If the cat is in front of him and he's bored and he feels like strangling the cat, he'll strangle the cat. 

Now, suppose you had this perfect psychopath in front of you, and you wanted to take it upon yourself to convince him to be a good person. You wanted to argue with him that he shouldn't be this kind of person. So you started off by saying look, you know when you harm people, when you do things to people and they hate it, and it hurts them. And he says yeah. And he says well how would you feel if other people did that to you. And he would answer well I, I would hate that and then you say so do you recognize the symetry. 

And he would respond and say, sure, I'm not an idiot, I'm a highly intelligent psychopath. ___I recognize that the two are a lot alike. I just don't care.___ And then you could throw some philosophy at him. So you could talk about a consequentialist like Bentham, who would argue that the right thing to do is to increase the sum of pleasure in the world. And you say to him, look, you, look at your actions, you're decreasing the sum of pleasure. You're increasing the amount of pain in the world. And he could say, I don't care. I understand I'm making the world worse. I just don't care. You could talk about deontological philosophers like Immanuel Kant and tell him about the categorical imperative and he could say, I understand the categorical comparative. And remember, I'm a smart guy. I just don't care. I don't care if I make the world worst. I don't care if my acts are not the sort of acts one would want to extent universally. 

The only way you can get the psychopath to act in a decent way is through threats of punishment or reward. And, you know, this is one reason why we have prisons. __It's one reason why we have, we have fines, some societies executions, because there're some proportion of people in the world where the only way they will act decently towards other people.__ The only way other people's feelings and emotions will count is if they know that if they don't act that way they themselves are going to be hurt. They are going to have their money taken away from them. They are going to be put into a cage. They are going to be killed. 

Now, this is just a way of introducing an idea argued by David Hume and other philosophers that In order to get morality off the ground, in order to be motivated to do good things and not bad things, you need to have some spark of feelings. __You need to have other people have to matter to you. If not, you're no better then the psychopath.__ And we can take this insight and turn it around. And say, look, since we have morality, since most people listen to this. Do have a sense of right and wrong. This means that we must have had some spark of compassion, some of these feelings. We are not inherently psychopaths, and this makes morality possible.

Now, the point, the idea that people have fundamentally kind thoughts towards others, that would regard others with some degree of caring and compassion, is an old one. And it was articulated, I think, most clearly by Adam Smith in, in, in his writings in the 1700s. Now, some of you may know Adam Smith as the founder of modern economics. He wrote this classic book, an inquiry into the, wealth of nations, into nature and cause of wealth of nations. which, in which he argued he defended in part a somewhat free market. He defended the idea that self-interested agents working just for their own benefit can in some societies have things work that things end up for the benefit of everybody. goodness, emerges as through the invisible hand as an emergent property of self-interest and greed. 

But it's easy to misread this as saying that Adam Smith himself thought people were greedy and self-serving. And nothing could be further from the true. So wealth of nations was Adam Smith's second book. His first book which he said was his finest book, was The Theory of Moral Sentiments. And this is a brilliant discussion of our natural inclinations towards sympathy, towards kindness, sometimes towards punishment and justice and vengeance. And he begins this book with a couple of, a few sentences I think eloquently capture a lot about human nature. 

So, he writes. However selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him. That we often derive sorrow from the sorrow of others, is a matter of fact too obvious to require any instances to prove it. So Smith says he doesn't need any examples, and I am not going to provide any examples. I'll ask you to provide your own. So imagine, imagine a person you love in the world, could be your, your child, your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, your best friend, your, your, there must be somebody. And imagine that person in sorrow, imagine that person is suffering. How does that make you feel? Now, if your answer is meh, I'm fine. Then you're a psychopath, then, then you're one of the small proportion of people who, who may well lack fellow feeling. 

But most of us would say, wow, I don't want that to happen. I don't want somebody I care for to suffer. I want that suffering to go away. And, and so this seems to be sort of a fundamental aspect of ourselves. Now one can reasonably ask, and is a, I think an extremly interesting scientific question, where does this come from? Why do we care about others? What happens to us or has happened to us that causes us to care about others? 

And one common enough view is that we're not born that way. We're born entirely cold blooded. But it's not an idea that I believe is right. I think that right now, enough, enough of, there is by now, enough of a body of evidence from studies and observations of babies and young children, to suggest that, on some degree compassion shows up early. 

So, one finding for instance is a baby's crying. So, how do you make a baby cry? Well, there's a lot of ways to do this. But one way to do it which is pretty powerful, is expose the baby to the cries of other babies. The baby will hear the sound of other babies and then start to cry, him or herself. Now some very cynical psychologists have said, well that doesn't show anything. Maybe babies are so stupid that they hear the sounds of other babies crying, they think they themselves are crying, this panics them, so they cry some more. But then even more clever psychologists did another study, where they expose babies to the sound of crying babies and these were tape recordings, either of their own cries or other babies cries. And they find that babies get upset more at the sound of their own cries than at the cries of others, suggesting it really is some sort of outer directed feeling. And this is supported in different ways. We know that babies when they see someone else suffering as soon as they're able to might pat and soothe the other person to try to make them feel better. And we know that toddlers will start to share and help those around them, particularly those they are familiar with and those that they care about such as their siblings and, and, and, and maybe their friends. It's not it's hard to disagree then, with Adam Smith's claim that some compassion, some fellow feeling is part of our nature. 

Now there are a lot of open questions. You might ask how would this develop over life span. You might ask, okay part of it maybe is hard wired, how could this evolve? Is it shared by other animals like chimpanzees and monkeys? You might arg-, wonder about the extent to which it varies across cultures. Are some people in some societies more compassionate than others? You might you might wonder to what extent is this compassion pure? Or to what extent it sort of regulated by self-interest, by selfish priorities. And those are all great questions. And in fact those are the sort of questions we're going to be dealing with throughout the rest of the course. But I want to turn now in the next lecture to the limits of compassion. So we've talked so far about our feelings towards those around us, what about our feelings towards strangers?

## 2.2: How Do We Treat Others?

I agree with Adam Smith that we have compassion towards those we are close to. I think he's right that you don't need any examples to show that. But when it comes to strangers, the issue is quite a bit more complicated. And actually the theme of how we think about strangers, and the way our moral psychology interacts with strangers, is to me so interesting and is important, that we're going to return to it over and over and over again, in the lectures that follow. But I want to to introduce the idea, here. And I want to sort of, for us to consider how we think about strangers, and, to, to, to introduce this idea, I'm going to give a lecture in four parts. 

So, the first part is an observation, and it's an observation by the primatologist and anthropologist Sarah Hardy. And Hardy, at the beginning of her wonderful book, Mothers and Others, describes being on an airplane. So she had been through security, she had been groped by the TSA agent, she's kind of crabby, she's sitting in a seat, she's, and, and, and the food is coming, you could smell the food, you could hear people in front of you getting it But she's, but it hasn't got to her yet. And somewhere on the plane, a baby starts crying. And people roll their eyes, and they're stuck together. And to pass the time, Hardy writes, I cannot help from wondering what would happen if my fellow human passengers suddenly morphed into another species of ape. What if I were traveling with a plane load of chimpanzees. Any one of us would be lucky to disembark with all 10 fingers and toes still attached. With the babies still breathing and un-maimed. Bloody earlobes and other appendages would litter the aisles. 

Compressing so many, highly impulsive strangers into such a tight space, would be a recipe for mayhem. Yet millions of us, billions of us, fly each year. And it's very rare that the plane lands and then they open up the doors and it's coated with blood and body parts and everything. We behave, we sit quietly, we wait our turn. And this is, this is extraordinary. This is an unusual response to strangers. As Hardy points out, chimpanzees and other primates, our closest evolutionary relatives, are nowhere near as nice. The response to dealing with the seen strangers, if you're a non-human primate, is often panic, is often aggression. But not for us. We are able to cope with strangers, we are able to inhibit our violence, our aggression, our frustration in the presence of strangers, and that's the first observation. 

The second part of this lecture, discusses how it's even better than that. It's not just that we don't want to kill other people who we were not used to. Rather is that, to some extent, we resonate to them, and we want to help them. And I think the, the clearest examples here are the internet. So any of us who spend a lot of time on the internet, and the fact you're watching me suggests you spend some time on the Internet, spends a lot of time dealing with strangers. Spends a lot of time dealing with people who aren't your friends, aren't your family. You never met them before. Yet we often have these productive, complicated interactions with strangers that aren't obviously self-serving. 

Now admittedly some of these interactions are not necessarily compassionate. Sometimes they're aggressive. Many people spend a lot of time on the internet arguing with strangers. This classic XKCD comic indicates the fact that it is extremely frustrating to deal with the somebody on the internet who is wrong. And there's a tremendous impulse to correct them. And the comment section on blogs refelcts this very human implulse. I wouldn't want to call that compassion, but there's a lot of what seems very cleary to be compassion and, and one example of this is sites with reviews. I'm thinking of Amazon and TripAdvisor, Travelocity, Yelp. These are sites that describe things like books, or products or restaurants, and then people come in and they, and they review them. And they tell you what they think of them. 

And, now some of these people may be motivated by gratitude in some way. When there is a negative review, you could say is revenge or vengeance. But for most part, people are going on to say, oh, I really like this show and what they're telling you is, they are, they are doing something for you. They are doing you a favor, but they don't know you. And this is altruism for the strangers, and it's a, it's an extraordinarily interesting fact about human nature.

When giving lists of irrational, not self serving behavior people often describe tipping. So, it's one thing to tip in a restaurant you're going to come back to because the size of your tip could affect your own, how people think of you, how people respond to you. But people leave tips in a restaurant they know they'll never going to go back to. They put money on the table. and, and even though they'll get no benefit from it. Or as an even more extreme case, think about, hotel rooms. And this varies from culture to culture. But there's, th, th, there's a custom in which I was raised in, that you're supposed to leave a tip when you leave a hotel room. So you, you know you pack up and everything and you put some money down. You maybe write a note that says thank you. The interesting thing about this is, this cannot conceivably help you in any way. It's not like the people who clean the room are going to say what a wonderful guy. I'll go back and do him a favor one day. They don't even know who you are. Yet we are compelled to do this. We might feel embarrassed if we forgot. We may feel ashamed of ourselves. We may feel proud of ourselves if we do it. And this goes to show that our morality is plugged in, in an interesting way, towards our interactions with people who we don't know, we will never know, we will never meet again. 

There's charity. People give an enormous amount of money to charity. Now, some of these charities are self-serving in a way. If I give money to support a museum that I myself am going to enjoy. Sometimes, the impulse to give to charity, may be an impulse to enhance our reputation, to show ourselves off as good people. Oh, look at, you know, I am donating this amount of money. I get my name listed in some program and people say, what a great guy he is. But some of our charitable acts are none of these. People give money to international charities to help starving children, and we often do this anonymously? No feedback, nothing. We do it because we feel it's right. We are compelled, we do this because we feel it's right and because we care about other people, again, people we will never see. 

This was this was the topic of a wonderful experiment by Stanley Milgram. And what he did was, he had letters made up. They were stamped, addressed letters. And so he made them up. And they'd say, with a person's name, I forget the name, you know? Joe Smith and an address. And he went through the streets of New Haven, or had his students do it, and would drop them. Or he'd put them up on a windowsill. Or he'd slip them under a door. None, none of them ended up, he didn't put any of them in a mailbox. So here's the question. How many of them would get, would be sent? They knew where they were sending them. They had to check the mailbox where it's supposed to be sent to. How many would be sent? In order for them to be sent, somebody has to pick up the letter, say oh, here's a letter. Go to a mailbox and drop it in. That was well over half. Well over half of these letters arrived at their destination. And this means that people must have picked up the letter and said, oh gosh, this is a letter that somehow went astray and put it in a mailbox. Again, an act which will do, which leads to no self-serving benefit. But it's simply done in some sense out of the goodness of your heart. Now if your cynical you might say maybe there's employees of the city or maybe people just automatically did it. 

But Milgram did something clever. Some of the letters were addressed to a person. Some of the letters were addressed to an organization that he felt people wouldn't like. So some of the letters were addressed to friends of the Nazi party. When they had that address they didn't arrive at the destination. So, it's not that they were indiscriminately looking at it and throwing it in a mailbox. Rather people were making a decision. And if it was for something which they didn't think was good, they wouldn't send it. 

There was even another study done by Dan Festler in California, where he looked at different things. But one of his conditions was, he did the same study as Milgram, except he didn't put a stamp on the letter, he just addressed it. Now most of those letters did not get back. But about 10 to 20% did. Which means people picked up a letter said oh, here's a letter for somebody it has no stamp. They went, they got a stamp, they put on it, and they mail it. And I think this is just extraordinary, I think this says something very interesting with how we work. So call those two stories the bright side of things, that's the positive side of our feelings to strangers. 

But there's also, as you could imagine, limitations about our compassion to strangers. There's, there's limits as to how much we care about them compared to how much we about the people around us. And the third case I'll give you is, is actually part of a comedy routine by Louis C K. This is unusual because it's the only Louis C K excerpt in which he doesn't swear. But he says something very interesting about our relationship to strangers. 

_My life is really evil, like I, there are people who are starving in the world, and I drive an Infinity. That's really evil. There are people who just starved to death, that's all they ever did. There's people who are like born, and they go, I'm hungry, and then they just die.  And that's all they ever got to do. And meanwhile I'm in my car, boom, boom like having a great time and I sleep like a baby. It's totally my fault because I could, I could trade my Infinity for like a really good car like a nice Ford Focus with no miles on it. And I'd get back like $20,000. And I could save hundreds of people from dying of starvation with that money, and every day I don't do it. Every day I make them die with my car._

Now Louis C.K. ends by saying, everyday I make them die with my car. And of course it's a joke. This isn't literally make them die. He doesn't literally kill them. He has no malice towards them. He's not acting to kill them. But in another level, it's not a joke. Another level, it actually reiterates a consequentialist argument that we've seen before. That one should judge actions based on their consequences. And from that point of view, if its true, that by buying a car instead sending the money to a charitable organization, if its true that this leads to the death of some kids, then Louis CK has killed them just as much as if he ran them all over with his car. 

Now this is a radical claim. It's a strong claim. It's in part the view of the philosopher Peter Singer who's a who is a consequentialist and who argues that we should judge our acts based on our consequences, and because of that, we should radically change how we how we treat people and, and, and our charitable giving. And he has a moving philosophical argument of which the conclusion is we should do more to help people in far away lands. And I have a feeling that, that Louie CK in his routine has actually drew upon the insides of Peter Singer. I'm going to present the argument right now. 

What's interesting is this argument, although it's been presented in philosophical journals and elsewhere, it's now presented as a Youtube video. So, this is the fourth and final case of how we think about strangers and it's expressed in this extremely interesting video. That's a political argument, it's a social argument. And, you may not believe it. You may object to it. You may disagree with it. You may endorse it, think it's very convincing. That's not the point here. My point is not to persuade you to do one thing or another. Those are your own decisions. 

But what I like about this video is that it illustrates certain things, certain psychological truths. And one truth it illustrates is that there's a psychological distinction between three categories of people. One category is the stranger in front of us. The girl we see, we know we don't know, but the girl we see drowning in the pond. The second category is an anonymous stranger, the one we don't see, the girl in Africa drowning in a pond. And then the third is the family member, our own daughter, our own mother, father, sister, brother, son um; and these are three categories of people and um; and we think very differently about them. And one insight is, when our natural reaction to them, is that we could care a lot about those in our life. People we love. People we, we interact with. And we are also driven to care a lot about a stranger, a drowning girl in front of us, as if seeing her triggers something. It triggers a sense of obligation. If I told you that I, I he'd, Singer never tries to make the argument we should help the girl in the pond. He just assumes it. And he's right to assume it. If I told you, I was rushing to work and there was a girl drowning, but I was kind of in an hurry, so I let her drown. You'd think I was a monster, and you'd be right. So you have on the one hand your feeling towards family members, your feelings towards people suffering for any. And then your feelings towards anonymous strangers. That's very different. We don't have the same pull. If I told you I knew about children in far away lands who were starving to death, who needed medical care, and I still bought a nice car, well, you might think I shouldn't be doing this, but you wouldn't think I'm a monster. In fact, most of us do stuff like that all the time. 

So you have these psychological distinctions. And this helps explain our moral reaction to a case we talked about in the very first lecture. So remember I told you the story, true story of these two guys who go in to the casino and one of them molests and kills the child, and the second one doesn't do anything. He just observes it, but he doesn't stop it. And later on he's interviewed on this, because they don't press charges, not a crime to just not help a stranger. If I walk past that drowning girl in the pond, I might end up saying morally wrong, but I haven't done anything legally wrong. And then he's asked, so what was up with that? And he says, the simple fact remains I don't know this little girl. I don't know people in Panama or Africa who are killed every day, so I can't feel remorse for them. And, you know, he's missing something. 

So he's actually right in his second claim. The people in far away lands if you're not in Panama, if you're not in Africa, you're not typically going to care about people who suffer there. It's okay not to do anything to help them. But that girl in front of you, the person in your vicinity, that person you should care about. Now, Peter Singer uses these psychological facts to make a moral argument. So he starts by saying he would help the little girl whose in front of you, and people watching you and say, yeah of course. Well, isn't that just the same, as if she was drowning in, in, in Africa? And then later on he says, oh, well maybe you think the girl in Africa is just a drop in a bucket. But what if she were your daughter? Isn't that the same? She's somebody's daughter. And so what you see here is an appreciation of our gut instincts. Singer is well aware that you don't normally think of the girl in Africa as we're saving, as we're sacrificing for. But he tries to argue through analogy that there's no real difference Between her case and the case, the cases where you do think you'd be right to intervene. And, among other things, this shows us the limits and the scope of compassion but it also illustrates moral argument. It illustrates how people could try to use reason, to try to use arguments, analogies, examples to change the way you think about the world. And I think this is deeply significant and it's another topic which we're going to continue to discuss, as these lectures develop.

## 2.3: Empathy and Concern

So, why would people matter to us? Where does compassion come from? You can imagine different possibilities. You can imagine people have compassion of a sort, just out of selfishness. It might be that your pleasure matters to me because in some way we're in the sort of a relationship where you being happy leads to be being happy. Maybe we're sort of business partners working together or something or we're in some sort of mutual benefit system, where your benefit is my benefit and your suffering is my suffering. I'll leave it for a question for later whether this even counts as compassion, but it's one source of nice behavior towards others. 

We might care about other people because of our religious code. You could imagine we care about other people because we believe that God wishes us to. We might care about other people because we are committed to some philosophical theory of morality of the sort we discussed earlier like consequentialsm or Kantian theory in which other people's happiness and feelings and goals matter to us. But many people have argued that a lot of what of goes on in compassion comes from our gut, comes from our heart. It is not a, it's not for self-serving benefit, nor is it because of our belief system. But, rather it's because we're wired up to care about other people. And the specific proposal as to what could drive compassion, and some people argue drive morality more generally, is that empathy plays an important role. 

So, let me define empathy. Empathy is based on a German word. The term is a new term, it was coined in the early 1900s, and it means to feel one's way into and when you think about empathy, you can think of it as being in someone else's shoes, putting yourself in someone else's shoes. 

Now, the idea that empathy plays a big role in, our morality and our compassion, is something again, you find in Adam Smith. So, Adam Smith argues that sort of foundation for caring about other people, is imagining yourself in their shoes. And he gives an example of how this can be, can be done. He says when, when we see a stroke aimed and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person we naturally shrink and draw back our own leg or arm and when it does fall, we feel it in some measure, and are hurt by it as well as the sufferer. Now, once you start looking for examples of how empathetic connection, affects you, you can see them all over the place. 

Here's one of my favorite examples. It's, It's a picture from a wonderful book called Emotional Contagion and you can see the guy is tensing up in anticipated feeling of the pain of the needle of the child he's holding. And you know, I saw the movie Casino Royale, the James Bond movie a little while ago. And there's a scene where the character James Bond is shackled naked to a chair and then whacked in the testicles. And me and I think just about every other male in the theater is going oh, in vicarious pain. But it's not just pain, it's also pleasure.

Why would anybody enjoy watching another person laugh? Well, because somehow the happiness of the kid jumps from him to us and so it's hard to watch a video like that without being sort of cheered up a bit because we're naturally primed to take on the perspective and feeling of others. And in fact, when people develop theories of empathy, theories drawing upon psychology and neuroscience, they often see it as related to a more general, propensity to imitate other people, to be the people we are interacting with. Here is an example of the imitation. A soccer player has just missed a big kick and he, he puts his hand on both sides of his head. But now, look at the people around them. We imitate each other all the time. __There are studies showing that, when you have two people who are talking to each other, they'll unconsciously start to imitate the, the, the behavior of the other.__ My wife, when she's with her Texas relatives, she starts to drawl. And in fact, whenever you're talking to somebody with an accent, there's this irresistible temptation to start speaking that accent too. It's part of how we respond to other people. 

And it shows up like a lot of what I'm talking about, even in babies. __So, the developmental psychologist Andrew Meltzov, many years ago, found that, that babies are natural mimics.__ Here is a clip of him making different facial expressions and a baby making those expressions back at him. And you watch a mother or father with a baby, where you'll see is this sort of dance as it were, where one of them will make an expression other one will do it back and so on. Some people have argued that there's a specific neural system that underlies this imitation, underlies this empathy, known as mirror neurons. And mirror neurons were first discovered with, non human primates. And what they are is they're activated when you do an action like reach for something. But they're also activated, when you observe another individual do the same action. And this suggest that, that at some neural level there's no distinction between us and them. There's no distinction between you and another person. As we experience the, the, imitate the motor movements of another person you could feel a connection to them and this imitation could itself drive, drive empathy. 

So, one demonstration of this involves facial expressions and here the excellent works been done by the psychologist Paul Ekman. So, Paul Ekman points out there's certain universal facial expressions. Humans all around the world have them. And I've shown some of them here. They're, you go around, the list there, anger, fear, disgust, sadness, happiness, and surprise. These are universal. But what's interesting is two things. One thing is you'll naturally mimic someone's facial expression. So, if you're sitting across from me and I'm frowning. You'll start to frown. Also when you imitate the expression, due to the facial feedback that, that, that ensues you'll start to feel the same feelings that I'm feeling. So, if I'm really happy and I'm grinning like a idiot, you'll start to grin like an idiot and if you grin like an idiot it'll make you happy. Some of the most annoying advice you can tell a depressed person is you should smile more. This is incredibly annoying but it's true. It's true for two reasons. One is, if you smile people will smile back at you and they'll like you more. But the second one is, and there's, there's laboratory studies on this, the very act of going like this, of moving the corners of your lips upwards triggers the feelings typically associated with smiling, that is, happiness and smiling in some small way, boost your mood. It might be parenthetically that that is mirroring of, of others and, and our propensity to do so and the pleasure we get from doing so, could exlpain some mysteries of human psychologies. 

And these are mysteries that go quite a bit beyond the questions of morality we are interested but I can't resist talking about it here. So, I am going to show you a little clip. I am going to show it's, I'll show you one minute of this clip, and it's from a series of videos called, Where the Hell is Matt. Where this sort of non-descript guy dances to music with different people across the world. So, I show you this clip, the last like, minute, minute five seconds and as your watching it, monitor your own, for example monitor what your doing. And second, monitor your own feelings. We were all dancing here, me, the camera guys, everybody. That's one thing. One thing is upon seeing this, you'll be tempted to move with it. This is most extreme in children. My sons and I, when they were younger, we'd watch a lot of kung fu movies together. And they can't watch a kung fu movie without leaping up and kicking people and things, and so on. It's just irresistible. But second, not only are you tempted to move with it, but often there's some sort of warm feeling associated with it, some human connection. And this illustrates how other people's movements and your movements, and your propensity to imitate these movements lead to sort of connections of feelings, and connections of positive feelings. And this could be viewed as a manifestation of empathy. 

So, let's step back. You have concern for others, other people matter to you. And you have empathy which is putting yourself in other people's shoes. And you can do empathy through an act of imagination. You could think I wonder what it's like to be her and think about that. I wonder what, what his experience is like. But you could also do it viscerally by seeing another person, act in some way. The theory worth taking seriously then is that empathy is a spark for compassion. And it's not hard to see how this could work. 

Let's assume, because it's true, but it's kind of obvious, that I don't like feeling pain and so if I feel pain, I'll want to stop that. But let's also assume that if I see you in pain I'll feel your pain empathy, and I'll want to stop that. Because by stopping you from feeling your pain, I'll stop me from feeling, my pain. Suppose I see you happy and that makes me happy, I'll want more of that because I like being happy. You can say that empathy dissolves the boundaries between yourself and another person. And so, this predicts that when you are in empathetic state with somebody, when you are taking their persperctive, you will adopt their interest. You will care about them. You will feel compassion and concern. And there is a fair amount of evidence that this is true. 

A lot of work comes from the psychologist Dan Batson. And Batson has done dozens of studies, perhaps hundreds of studies by now, where he, he gets people in a situation where they have to choose whether to help somebody or whether to care about somebody. And he finds that if he can get them to feel empathy, to see it how they feel, to see it how, how the other person sees it, to feel it as the other person feels it, the odds of them being kind and caring go up. So, for instance, you could tell a story about a girl who is in line for a life saving operation, and there's other people ahead of her, and then if you just ask the person, ask your experimental subject, try to take this girl's perspective, try to see it as she seen it. That raises the odds your willing to take that girl and move her up to the front of the line, that you're willing to rescue her. Because the shared feelings motivate compassion. They motivate caring. In general, this effect, the fact that empathetic connections with individuals boost up your feelings towards them is the spark of what sometimes called the identifiable victim effect. 

__The identifiable victim effect is the idea that we care a lot more when there's a person in front of us than some numbers.__ And, and this is something which has been observed by many people. Joseph Stalin apocryphally said, a single death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic. Mother Teresa said, if I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will. And there is actually experimental work done demonstrating this, so, there's, a series of wonderful studies done by Deborah Small and Paul Slovic and George Loewenstein, where you give people the facts, you give people data about a crisis, involving numbers and hard facts and you see how much they care. And, and how much they'll donate. And in this example where they throw out a lot of statistics at people, your average person hearing it will give about a dollar. But then another group, you tell about an individual, an individual with a name and with a face. And this bumps it up considerably. There are some studies that find that you will care more and give more to save one person with a name and a face, than five people who you are not told their names and you are not shown their faces. And this I think shows the power of empathy. 

Now, nothing that I'm saying would be a surprise to those who spend their lives trying to get people to give to charities. __So if you look at the, at the ads for charities, they don't say, okay, here's our charity, here's the statistics, here's the data, here's the graphs, and so on. They'll show you a picture. They'll tell you about an individual.__ I know this from personal experience. When I was in graduate school, I was extremely persuaded by Peter Singer's argument which I talked about in a previous lecture. That we need to give much more to charity, that, that we are doing something wrong by not, by, by spending money on luxuries instead of giving the money to save people's lives. I was very persuaded by this and still am kind of. And I would tell this to my friends. I tell this to my fellow graduate students, and, and you know, we'd be out for a beer and we'd be drinking a beer and I would say you know that beer could save a child's life. And, and you are murdering a child, and me too, by drinking these beers. And at one point one of my graduates, one of my friends who was a graduate student, a philosopher actually, got really sick of me. And he said, how much do you give to charity? And I was sort like well, dude, it's a philosophical argument here. But I thought, well nothing, actually. And I was poor graduate student, but I was much richer than the people I was concerned about. So, I decided I should give money to charity. 

So, I sent away, and this is pre-internet, so I sent away a postcard to an organization, Child Reach and asked for information. And I remember getting the packet and I remember opening up the packet. And I remember expecting to see a lot of information about what their charity does and how they work and where the money goes and so on. But they were much smarter than that. I open up the packet, and there in it was a picture wrapped up in plastic of a small child. And the letter said, Dear Mr. Bloom, we know, we know you have not commited to giving us any money. We know, we know you're just asking for information and that's, that's fair enough. But, but we have enclosed a pictrure and then he told me that this is, and he told me the child's name. And they said, we know you are not committed to giving us money. But if you do give us money, this is the life you will save. 

And that is psychologically so much more powerful than, than data and then facts. And, and, and actually my family's still sending money to that, to that child and his family many, many years later. Now you, you could argue further that the kindness the boost we get from empathy is, can motivate kind behavior not just to individuals but to the groups that the that those individuals belong to. And this is a claim defended by the philosopher Martha Nussbaum. So, Nussbaum writes, talking about Greek tragedies, although all of the future citizens who saw ancient tragedies were male, they were asked to have empathy for suffering of many whose lot could never be theirs, such as Trojans and Persians and Africans, such as wives and daughters and mothers. And her argument is that one of the things fiction can do, fiction, also journalism and stories, movies, T.V. shows, is they can put you, get you to have empathy. Get you to put you in the shoes of those who you wouldn't otherwise be, be with. And by doing so, you might care not just about, about that individual, that fictitious individual, but rather the group that the individual belongs to. 

My own bet is that feelings in America towards, homosexuals were radically affected by situation comedies like Will and Grace, which showed gay people in a positive way. Made you root for them, made you care for them, put yourself in their shoes. Attitudes in America towards African-Americans, I think, were transformed by shows like The Cosby Show, which again put people in the shoes of these, these African-Americans who were perfectly fine and fun and enjoyable, and people you could sympathize with. And then the sympathy expanded to the group as a whole. 

Now, this is largely speculation. But we do know, historically, that there are cases where fiction has caused interesting and important moral changes. And one example has to do with Harriett Beecher Stowe. The story goes that, Abraham Lincoln invited her to the White House at the beginning of the Civil War and said to her, so you're the little lady who's caused this great big war. And he was talking about Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Uncle Tom's Cabin is not a book of great philosophy or legal reasoning or, theology or morality. It's it-, it, it's fictional. But what it does is, it get, it got the readers who were predominantly white people, some of whom were slave owners, to put themselves in the shoes of of slaves and see what their experience was and by doing so, served as a catalyst for moral change. So, I have argued that empathy could be a force for morality, both at a individual level but also maybe as at the group level too. 

In further support of this, I think we could look now at precisely what's wrong with people who don't care about other people. People who lack compassion. And this brings us back to psychopaths. So, psychopaths also known as sociopaths, you can use what ever term, they're not sensitive. They're typically male. To be a psychopath is defined by all sorts of characteristics. A clinical psychologist named Hare developed a psychopathy test. If you're curious about yourself you could take it online. Psychopaths tend to be selfish, they're callous, they're impulsive, they're promiscuous and have a deficit in normal feelings. They have a deficit in love and loyalty and guilt and shame and anxiety. They tend to be cold blooded characters. Psychopathy comes in all sorts of flavors. In some extreme cases you have these cold blooded psychopaths who are also very violent people. And these people cause so much of the misery in the world. 

I'll give you a few quotes to give you a feeling for psychopathy. you, by the way when you think of a psychopath you may well think of Hannibal Lector. Who is a classic Silence of the Lambs psychopath. But I tend to think of James Bond to show you that they're not all necessarily bad guys. Some of the psychopaths might be on our side. But James Bond also fits many of the characteristics. The Daniel Craig James Bond, not the Roger Moore James Bond. So, so, how do psychopaths talk? How do they think? Well you have to use extreme examples one of them which was reported by Damon in his book on morality is of a 13 year old who who would mug blind people. And he'd mug blind people because he figured they couldn't identify them, him later. And he was then asked later on, so you know, don't you care about the people whose lives you destroy, the people you assault? What about this woman you just attacked? And his response, I think, perfectly captures what a person is like without compassion. 

He said, what do I care? I'm not her. And in some way that's a good argument. You're not her, why should you care? Well, because humans normally are usually wired up to care, but it's hard to figure a logical argument, why you should. Ted Bundy, who was a serial killer, was once, once in a, in an interview while in prison, expressed surprise at the fuss that was made, on, that all of his murders. He said at one point, you know there are so many people, he was kind of puzzled why people were so concerned. And, one of the creepier examples, and this is from Jon Ronson's excellent book The Psychopath Test, is a guy named Peter Woodcock. And and this guy he he had raped and murdered 3 children and ended up in a psychiatric facility for the rest of his life. But he did get a three-hour leave to walk around the grounds after some years of good behavior. In the course of this, he invited a friend of his who was also on this leave to join him for a walk, and then killed his friend with a hatchet. So, he was asked, interviewed later about this event. And, and here's how he described it. So, the interviewer says, asks, what was going through your mind at that time? This was somebody you loved. And the psychopath answers, curiousity, actually, an anger, because he had rebuffed on my advances. And why did you feel someone should die as a result of your curiosity? I just wanted to know what it would feel like to kill somebody. And the interviewer asks, but you had already killed three people. And Woodcock replies, yes, but that was years and years and years and years ago. 

So, what's wrong with psychopaths? __Well, one answer is, that among their many deficits, they don't have normal empathetic feelings, towards others.__ They don't feel other people's pain, they don't feel other people's pleasure. And because of that the suffering that they caused doesn't come back at them, it doesn't resonate. Some people have argued that along with all of their deficits including empathetic deficits there's something very specific, very specific that's wrong with them. And this comes from the work of the psychologist Abagail Marsh. So Marsh did a series of studies where she took psychopaths who were in her lab and she showed them a series of faces. And the idea is you have to identify the face. What emotional expression, you, correspondents to that face. So, they would look at the face, on the, on the upper left and say, boy that woman looks angry, and they look at the face of the guy in the middle bottom and say that's one happy guy. __But there was one sort of face, that they had a lot of problems recognizing. That is, they would look at that face and they wouldn't have the foggiest idea what the person was feeling, though for a normal person, it was it was obvious. So, the face I'm talking about is in the top middle. It's fear.__ And Marsh argues that psychopaths have this specific deficit, empathizing with the fear of other people. She tells a story of, of, of a study, an interview, with actually a female psychopath, who identified all of the faces easily, except could have no idea what fear was. And then, finally, it came to her, and she said,' I don't know what that expression is called, but I know it's what people look like, right before I stab them. And I'll end with that.

## 2.4: Empathy and its Limits

We began by talking compassion, about other people mattering to us. And what we did in our last lecture is we looked at empathy. Putting yourself in another person's shoes. And we explored the extent to which empathy can drive compassion, and can drive morality more generally. And I actually think any complete theory of our moral life has to draw upon empathy. Has to draw upon this putting ourselves in another's shoes? But I also think it's a lot more complicated than that. I think that there are limits to empathy. There are limits to empathy which make it unreliable and untenable as a source for morality. To put it differently, to the extent we're good people and we live good and moral lives. Sometimes we will rely on empathy but sometimes we'll reject empathy. So, why do we want to do that? 

Well, one thing is, empathy is biased. we, we feel a lot more affection, a lot more empathy for a, a, a kitten than for a piglet. We feel a lot more empathy for a panda than for a chicken. This is not because of a deep reason moral argument about suffering and pain and intelligence and feelings. It's because some things are adorable, some things trigger our emotions. But part of what it is to be a moral person is sometimes overriding the fact that, that we feel warmly towards this but not that and ask ourselves deeper questions having to do with suffering and pain. Maybe you're not convinced. Maybe you think we should rescue the kitten, no matter what. 

But what about people? So, I don't think there are many people who will defend this, which is that in the courtroom, ju-, juries are particularly biased in favor of defendants who are physically attractive and who are baby-faced. Because our emotional response to attractiveness and baby-facedness, the looks of youth, is innocence, is innocence and sweetness and compassion. But surely somebody who is ugly and kind of griseled deserves just as fair a treatment. So, it seems there's an unfair world in which a young Leonardo DiCaprio would be acquitted of any crime, because of how his face resonates to us. More generally I think part of what goes on when we make a correct moral decision involves overriding our empathetic feelings. And in some cases, it's pretty clear that empathy could drive us not just to the incorrect choice, but actually to a straight-out immoral act. 

In part because it could pull our attention towards the one and away from the many. so, so, remember the study I told you about before saying, that we could more about one person than about five people. Particularly one person if you could see that person. But that's crazy. That's morally crazy. We shouldn't be swayed. Everyone has a face. Everybody has a name. Providing a name and a, and a, and a face sways us, but that's not the way it should work. If you think for minute that, that, that the way to be a good person is try to help the most people, then will often lead you astray. 

And actually one of the studies by Dam Batson illustrates this. So remember, we talked about his study where there's a girl, and she's waiting in line for an operation and if you take her perspective you move her up the line. But as Batson points out nobody think's it's the right thing to move her up the line. Nobody thinks, say for a list of people waiting in line for a heart transplant, you should walk and look at all of them and whoever inspires your feelings the most you should give em the heart transplant first. That's not right, it's not right because what inspires your feelings has to do with things like attractiveness and baby-facedness and whether the person's the same color, whether the person same background as you. What you want to do to have a moral system is, you have a system that, that, that doesn't take certain things into account. That is based on, on reason and not, and not gut feelings. 

Now, these are examples where empathy is biased and empathy could lead you astray. But there's also another argument, which is that for a lot of what's core to our morality, empathy is not enough. Empathy is limited. And I'll give you a few examples of this. One is example is sort of is, is kind of particular, but I think it's telling. It, it, it is something pointed out by William James. So James talks about our relationships with our dogs. Many people have dogs as pets. They feel very affectionate towards them. They, they, they love them and they care about them. But James points out, this is not a relationship that's founded on empathy. If my dog, I don't know whether my dog ever tries to take my perspective. Here's here's me and my, and my, my dog. I don't know if she ever tries to take my perspective but I don't think she does. And if she does, I don't thinks he would have any understanding of what I do all day which is mostly sit in front of the computer and go like this. And I don't really take her perspective very much either because her life is a mystery to me. She seems to spend all of her voluntary time sniffing at disgusting things and trying to eat disgusting things and it's just strange. And yet, and yet I care a lot for her. And I'd like to think she cares a lot for me. 

And James' point is, that you would have a, you know, a personal relationship, relationships founded on love and compassion without empathy. Consider again, as maybe a more salient example, ones relationship with ones baby. Soon empathy emerges and, and, and, and there's a synchrony and so on, but from the get go there's none of that. But still there can be an enormous amount of love. A lot of this sort of personal ideals, that matter to us most, don't have as much to do with empathy as one might first think. Now empathy is a particular, sorry, is particularly weak, when it comes to our finest moral ideals. When it comes to more general policy, and particularly when it comes to our treatment of strangers. And some of the weaknesses of empathy are nicely summarized by Steven Pinker, in his wonderful book Better Angels of our Nature, which we'll talk about later on in the class. So Pinker writes, I can't say that it's empathy that prevents me from taking out contracts on my critics, getting the fistfights over parking spaces, or threatening my wife when she points out I've dong something silly. My mind doesn't stop and ponder what it would be like to be the victims of these kind of violence and then recoil after feeling the victim's pain. Rather, my mind never goes in those directions in the first place. Pinker goes on to say that, you know, the Old Testament says you should love thy neighbor. The New Testament says you should love thy enemy. But frankly, he doesn't love either one of them. He loves the people he loves. But most of the world, his neighbors, his enemies and so on, he doesn't love them at all. And I, I don't love my, most of my neighbors and my enemies either, but we are moral towards them, we don't kill them. In some situations we will help them, we will sacrifice to help them.

And this shows that feelings have their limits. That, that sometimes our morality is grounded in, not in gut feelings, but in moral principles. And the importance of moral principles, the importance of moral reason, and the limits of gut feelings, are actually nicely illustrated in a story told by, yes, by Adam Smith. And I'm going to present his story. I'm going to modify it slightly for a more modern age. Imagine you learn about a death of sa-, thousands of strangers. Imagine you learn it, I mean Smith wrote in the 1700s, but imagine you learn yourself, right. You open up your computer, you put on your computer browser, and out comes some new stories. And one of news stories is in a country that you don't belong to. India, Argentina United States you know, Australia. Some place you don't know about. Some place that is not where you are. Thousands of people died. They died of a salmonella epidemic, they died of an earthquake, they died of, of a factory fire. How would you respond? Well, this actually isn't so strange to you, because if you open up your browser every day, thousands of people often die. So how do you respond? Well, I bet, I bet you, you know you say, oh, well that's too bad. That's unfortunate. Then you go about your business. 

And Adam Smith says that, that when exposed to the death of thousand of strangers. We will remark our disapproval, and say, oh, how what a terrible world, and then we will go on our life, and that night we will sleep with the most profound serenity. Now, imagine something different. Imagine instead, you were to learn that tomorrow you are going to lose your little finger. You can't see, so this is Smith's example, that tomorrow there going to chop off your little finger. You would say wow. You would say, wow, you would say, that's terrible. That's, that's, how am I going to, are they going to anesthesia? Which finger, which? How are they going to, why? What? And that night you wouldn't sleep a wink. So plainly, from a gut feeling, from an emotional response, the loss of your little finger matters more than the death of thousands of strangers. So this raises a question then, and a question is this: Since it matters so much more, this loss of a finger than the death of a thousand strangers. Would it follow that someone would sacrifice thousands of lives to save his little finger? 

And Smith writes, human nature startles with horror at the thought. His answer is no, nobody would do that. Look I'll even change the example. If you're extremely fond of your little finger maybe you would do that. I'll change the example. You discover that thousands of people are going to die, you say, oh, how sad, they've died, how sad, but also you notice your computer is slow. Your browser is slow. It's very frustrating. It's slow, it's unreliable, maybe your connection's fading in and out. It does not seem implausible, in fact it seems true, that that slow connection's going to bother you a lot more, than learning by the death of thousands of people. But still, if somebody, if you were offered then to speed up your connection, but thousands of people would die, you would say that's insane. 

So, here's the question then, and this is a question asked by Adam Smith. When our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish, how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble? And Smith continues, it is reason, principle, conscience; this calls to us, with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions, That we are but one of the multitude, in no respect better than any other in it. And this last phrase sums up morality. What a sophisticated morality is goes beyond gut feelings and selfish urges and desires to help people. But it also includes an understanding that we are but one of the multitude, in no respect better than any other in it. 

__And what you see in moral systems all around the world, from religion, from philosophy, is an appreciation that a moral code doesn't care about you as special.__ A moral code says, you're not special. It says that we have to figure out how to live our lives such e-, e-, in a way that would somehow apply to everybody. So this shows up in all of the versions of the golden rule. And all of Confucian statements about impartiality. It shows up in the consequentialism that we talked about, where the, the right way to live is to try to increase overall amount of pleasure and decrease overall amount of pain. It shows up in in Kant's categorical imperative. Where you should have a principle that applies to everybody that would make the world better all around. It applies to theories like John Rawls' Veil of Ignorance or Adam Smiths own Impartial Spectator. Now, it might sound like this is some sort of technical idea that, that only, you know, gurus and, and, and great intellects could think about, but in some sense, this is, this is a common sense that's accessible to all of us. We all appreciate that the right thing to do is often not about appealing to our gut and appealing to our immediate feelings and prejudices, but, but also to, to take the bigger view. 

And my favorite summary of this is from Rick Blaine, the character played by Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. And so the movie ends, sort of spoiler alert because I'm going to show you a clip. The movie ends with him talking about a sacrifice he must make, he and his, and his lover must make and why they must make it.

> But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

That is an astonishingly rich philosophical statement. And the fact that we could understand it, that we could understand that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans, compared to everything else that's going on shows that we're moral creatures. And making this sort of argument and extending this sort of argument back and forth to each other, is an example of how reason could play a role in our moral lives. So I started off, in the last week, talking about the power of gut feelings, the power of emotions and morality. Providing demonstration after demonstration after demonstration of how emotion shapes our moral reasoning and our moral action, and yet all of that's true. But now we're starting to encounter the power of reason. The power of reason that says that, yeah I know I favor this over that. I know I'm empathetic towards that, this rather than that. I know my selfish desires go for this rather than that. But I recognize that it's wrong. I recognize that there are higher moral principles at work, there are higher moral principles at stake. I may be happier if I save my little finger and a thousand people could die and but know that, that's wrong. I know that that's wrong because I know the people, the, the thousand other people are sons and fathers and mothers and daughter just as much as I am and the people I love are. And a appreciation of both the power of the emotions and the power of reason and rationality leads us to I think a more sophisticated understanding of what goes on in our moral lives. And I think now focusing on the interplay of emotion and reason, makes moral psychology a lot more interesting.

## The Baby in the Well

Obama said that it is important to be able “to see the world through the eyes of those who are different from us—the child who’s hungry, the steelworker who’s been laid off, the family who lost the entire life they built together when the storm came to town.” He went on, “When you think like this—when you choose to broaden your ambit of concern and empathize with the plight of others, whether they are close friends or distant strangers—it becomes harder not to act, harder not to help.”

__Batson has found that simply instructing his subjects to take another’s perspective made them more caring and more likely to help.__

Some of the same neural systems that are active when we are in pain become engaged when we observe the suffering of others. Other researchers are exploring how empathy emerges in chimpanzee and other primates, how it flowers in young children, and the sort of circumstances that trigger it.

This interest isn’t just theoretical. If we can figure out how empathy works, we might be able to produce more of it. Some individuals staunch their empathy through the deliberate endorsement of political or religious ideologies that promote cruelty toward their adversaries, while others are deficient because of bad genes, abusive parenting, brutal experience, or the usual unhappy goulash of all of the above. At an extreme lie the one per cent or so of people who are clinically described as psychopaths.

Emily Bazelon writes, “The scariest aspect of bullying is the utter lack of empathy”—a diagnosis that she applies not only to the bullies but also to those who do nothing to help the victims. Few of those involved in bullying, she cautions, will turn into full-blown psychopaths. __Rather, the empathy gap is situational: bullies have come to see their victims as worthless; they have chosen to shut down their empathetic responses.__ But most will outgrow—and perhaps regret—their terrible behavior. “The key is to remember that almost everyone has the capacity for empathy and decency—and to tend that seed as best as we possibly can,” she maintains.

Empathy has been the main driver of human progress, and that we need more of it if our species is to survive. Ehrlich and Ornstein want us “to emotionally join a global family.” Rifkin calls for us to make the leap to “global empathic consciousness.”

This enthusiasm may be misplaced, however. Empathy has some unfortunate features—it is parochial, narrow-minded, and innumerate. We’re often at our best when we’re smart enough not to rely on it.

Why do people respond to these misfortunes and not to others? The psychologist Paul Slovic points out that, when Holloway disappeared, the story of her plight took up far more television time than the concurrent genocide in Darfur. Each day, more than ten times the number of people who died in Hurricane Katrina die because of preventable diseases, and more than thirteen times as many perish from malnutrition.

There is, of course, the attention-getting power of new events. Just as we can come to ignore the hum of traffic, we become oblivious of problems that seem unrelenting, like the starvation of children in Africa—or homicide in the United States.

The key to engaging empathy is what has been called “the identifiable victim effect.” 

The number of victims hardly matters—there is little psychological difference between hearing about the suffering of five thousand and that of five hundred thousand.

In the broader context of humanitarianism, as critics like Linda Polman have pointed out, the empathetic reflex can lead us astray. When the perpetrators of violence profit from aid—as in the “taxes” that warlords often demand from international relief agencies—they are actually given an incentive to commit further atrocities. It is similar to the practice of some parents in India who mutilate their children at birth in order to make them more effective beggars. The children’s debilities tug at our hearts, but a more dispassionate analysis of the situation is necessary if we are going to do anything meaningful to prevent them.

A “politics of empathy” doesn’t provide much clarity in the public sphere, either. Typically, political disputes involve a disagreement over whom we should empathize with. Liberals argue for gun control, for example, by focussing on the victims of gun violence; conservatives point to the unarmed victims of crime, defenseless against the savagery of others. Liberals in favor of tightening federally enforced safety regulations invoke the employee struggling with work-related injuries; their conservative counterparts talk about the small businessman bankrupted by onerous requirements. So don’t suppose that if your ideological opponents could only ramp up their empathy they would think just like you.

On many issues, empathy can pull us in the wrong direction. The outrage that comes from adopting the perspective of a victim can drive an appetite for retribution. (Think of those statutes named for dead children: Megan’s Law, Jessica’s Law, Caylee’s Law.) But the appetite for retribution is typically indifferent to long-term consequences. In one study, conducted by Jonathan Baron and Ilana Ritov, people were asked how best to punish a company for producing a vaccine that caused the death of a child. Some were told that a higher fine would make the company work harder to manufacture a safer product; others were told that a higher fine would discourage the company from making the vaccine, and since there were no acceptable alternatives on the market the punishment would lead to more deaths. Most people didn’t care; they wanted the company fined heavily, whatever the consequence.

Too often, our concern for specific individuals today means neglecting crises that will harm countless people in the future.

Rifkin and others have argued, plausibly, that moral progress involves expanding our concern from the family and the tribe to humanity as a whole. Yet it is impossible to empathize with seven billion strangers, or to feel toward someone you’ve never met the degree of concern you feel for a child, a friend, or a lover. Our best hope for the future is not to get people to think of all humanity as family—that’s impossible. It lies, instead, in an appreciation of the fact that, even if we don’t empathize with distant strangers, their lives have the same value as the lives of those we love.

That’s not a call for a world without empathy. A race of psychopaths might well be smart enough to invent the principles of solidarity and fairness. (Research suggests that criminal psychopaths are adept at making moral judgments.) __The problem with those who are devoid of empathy is that, although they may recognize what’s right, they have no motivation to act upon it. Some spark of fellow-feeling is needed to convert intelligence into action.__

Putting aside the extremes of psychopathy, there is no evidence to suggest that the less empathetic are morally worse than the rest of us. Simon Baron-Cohen observes that some people with autism and Asperger’s syndrome, though typically empathy-deficient, are highly moral, owing to a strong desire to follow rules and insure that they are applied fairly.

Where empathy really does matter is in our personal relationships. Nobody wants to live like Thomas Gradgrind—Charles Dickens’s caricature utilitarian, who treats all interactions, including those with his children, in explicitly economic terms. Empathy is what makes us human; it’s what makes us both subjects and objects of moral concern. Empathy betrays us only when we take it as a moral guide.

Newtown, in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, was inundated with so much charity that it became a burden. More than eight hundred volunteers were recruited to deal with the gifts that were sent to the city—all of which kept arriving despite earnest pleas from Newtown officials that charity be directed elsewhere. A vast warehouse was crammed with plush toys the townspeople had no use for; millions of dollars rolled in to this relatively affluent community. We felt their pain; we wanted to help. Meanwhile—just to begin a very long list—almost twenty million American children go to bed hungry each night, and the federal food-stamp program is facing budget cuts of almost twenty per cent. Many of the same kindly strangers who paid for Baby Jessica’s medical needs support cuts to state Medicaid programs—cuts that will affect millions. Perhaps fifty million Americans will be stricken next year by food-borne illness, yet budget reductions mean that the F.D.A. will be conducting two thousand fewer safety inspections. Even more invisibly, next year the average American will release about twenty metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and many in Congress seek to loosen restrictions on greenhouse gases even further.

Such are the paradoxes of empathy. The power of this faculty has something to do with its ability to bring our moral concern into a laser pointer of focussed attention. If a planet of billions is to survive, however, we’ll need to take into consideration the welfare of people not yet harmed—and, even more, of people not yet born. They have no names, faces, or stories to grip our conscience or stir our fellow-feeling. Their prospects call, rather, for deliberation and calculation. Our hearts will always go out to the baby in the well; it’s a measure of our humanity. But empathy will have to yield to reason if humanity is to have a future.

## [Jon Ronson: Strange answers to the psychopath test](http://www.ted.com/talks/jon_ronson_strange_answers_to_the_psychopath_test.html)

It was a man called Brian who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies. They're called the CCHR. And I said to him, "Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted?" And he said, "Yes, we can prove it to you." And I said, "How?" And he said, "We're going to introduce you to Tony." And I said, "Who's Tony?" And he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor." Now Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. It's where they send the serial killers and the people who can't help themselves. And I said to Brian, "What did Tony do?" And he said, "Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something, and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane.

And then Brian said, "Here's Tony." And a man was walking in. And he wasn't overweight, he was in very good physical shape. And he wasn't wearing sweatpants, he was wearing a pinstriped suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane.

Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy. He said, "I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what's on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist, and recently it had an article about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, 'Did you know that the U.S. army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives?' When I read my medical notes, I saw they'd written: 'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'" He said, "You know, they're always looking out for non-verbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way? How do you cross your legs in a sane way? It's just impossible." And when Tony said that to me, I thought to myself, "Am I sitting like a journalist? Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"

He said, "You know, I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose." So only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway he seemed completely normal to me -- but what did I know?

And when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden. I said, "What's the story?" And he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because his hallucinations that had seemed quite cliché to begin with just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him. And we have determined that what he is is a psychopath." And in fact, faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. It's on the checklist: cunning and manipulative. So faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts, and they said the pinstriped suit -- classic psychopath. Speaks to items one and two on the checklist -- glibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth. And I said, "Well, what, he didn't want to hang out with the other patients?" Classic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence, according to his clinician, that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath.

And his clinician said to me, "If you want to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopath spotting course run by Robert Hare who invented the psychopath checklist." So I did. I went on a psychopath spotting course, and I am now a certified -- and I have to say, extremely adept -- psychopath spotter.

So here's the statistics: One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath. So there's 1,500 people in his room.

Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative. In fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless, is a physical manifestation of psychopathy. It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all.

I emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce, just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said, "I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless. Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly?" And he said, "Come on over."

And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, "Okay, go on." And I said, "Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth." Which, I have to say, would have been hard for him to deny because he was standing underneath a giant oil painting of himself. (Laughter) He said, "Well, you've got to believe in you!" 

And I said, "Manipulative." He said, "That's leadership." And I said, "Shallow affect: an inability to experience a range of emotions." He said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?" So he was going down the psychopathic checklist, basically turning it into "Who Moved My Cheese?"

I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had turned me a little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked psychopath. I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges.

When I got back to London, Tony phoned me. He said, "Why haven't you been returning my calls?" I said, "Well they say that you're a psychopath." And he said, "I'm not a psychopath." He said, "You know what, one of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative. So when you say you feel remorse for your crime, they say, 'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.' It's like witchcraft. They turn everything upside-down."

So I went to his tribunal. And after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go. They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me, "You know what, Jon? Everyone's a bit psychopathic." He said, "You are. I am. Well obviously I am." I said, "What are you going to do now?" He said, "I'm going to go to Belgium because there's a woman there that I fancy. But she's married, so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband."

And then he phoned me. And you know what, I think it's right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges. And what Tony is, is he's a semi-psychopath. He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find the complexity, it's where you find the humanity and it's where you find the truth. And Tony said to me, "Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me." And I didn't go. What would you have done?

## Upside of Irrationality Chapter 9: On Empathy and Emotion
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlzHxULncNM)

Why is it the case that we don't care about malaria? Could it be because it's just a big problem?

Tsunami/9-11, could it be because it's closer or it's more shocking?

How much we care vs. magnitude of the problem doesn't matter. It's all about activating the emotions. So how do we get people to care?

American cancer society: The word "cancer." The word "survivor." People are asked to recruit friends and families, so people get connected.

__The key to action is not thoughtful deliberation, it's emotion.__ If we think in a calculated manner, we will be selfish. The activation of emotion will get us to care about the problems.

## Week 2 Office Hours

I think, I think there's that temptation. I think sometimes we hear of a moral problem. And our gut feeling is we should be consequentialists. We should be utilitarians. Then we hear about another moral issue and we say we should be, you know, Kantians and another one strikes us as virtue ethics seems like the best approach. But the problem is that we always have to make these choices. And if we arbitrarily say and, if we pick our moral philosophy depending on our gut feelings at the time. We're not really having a moral philosophy, we're just feeling what we feel and then choosing a philosophy as a way to justify it. 

And the problem is in a real world, these philosophies give us different answers. They give us different answers as to whether it's right for for gay people to marry. Or for a President to use drones to bomb a foreign country. Or, or all sort, or the trolley problem to chose an abstract one, your moral philosophy would give you different answers. And so, so the act of making it a choice. If you say I'm going to choose which one to be, well, you're going to need a moral philosophy to tell you what choice to make.

But often we're forced to struggle with the question of what the right thing is to do and then we need something to guide us. 

> So how would you characterize your own moral philosophy? 

I try to avoid personal questions and this sort of thing, but I will, I will answer that one. I've often struggled with it.

I'm a consequentialist. I think that, that the morality of something, rests entirely on it's consequences. But I'm a I'm a nervous and uncertain consequentialist. And I, I, I respect the idea emphasized by Jonathan Height, among other people, that often consequences can be indirect and subtle and uncertain. So, so take torture. I have no doubt at all that there are all sorts of cases where torturing somebody saves lives. And, and at, in that moment the pain of the tortured person is nothing compared to the pain that would incur if a person wasn't tortured. If we didn't find out where the bomb was and so on, I have no doubt about that.

But I'm still against torture, and I'm against torture because I worry, like a lot of people that, even though it might be right for that moment. In the long run having a society where people have the right to torture prisoners, or torture suspected criminals corrodes the society and from a cold-blooded consequentialist point of view, it makes things wrong in the long run. I mean, here's an example I actually give my, my kids when talking. if, if, if it's three in the morning and nobody's on the street and there's a red light, should you just drive through it, knowing no one will be hurt? And the answer is no, you should stop. You should stop and obey the law. Not because you're some sort of Kantian or deontologist, but because in general it's good to obey the law, to obey traffic laws. Even in cases where you know full well, that it's pointless. So, I mean the technical term is I guess I'm a rule utilitarian, a rule consequentialist. But, but that's where I stand.

> Can you just define rule consequentialist a little more?

Act: Focuses on what people would do on the spot.

Rule: Create a rule that dictates your behavior and your action even if certain applications of the rule are astray. Ex: drinking, the rule is < 21 aren't allowed to drink, but there are 22 or 40 that shouldn't be allowed to drink.
 
> Can empathy trigger altruistic motivations so can we, can we really be sort of purely motivated by empathy and purely altruistic?

Empathetic: you have makes you genuinely care for other people and help them out of genuine care. Alternate is you help for selfish reasons, and a selfish reason is helping to get the buzz you get from helping somebody. 

And what Batson's done over the last many years, is he's constructed dozens, probably hundreds of experiments that try to pull this apart. __And he argues, I think convincingly, that the buzz explanation doesn't work.__ And, and so I invite people to look at these studies. But what I would add is that on an intuitive level this sort of cynical selfish theory of altruism doesn't, doesn't seem to work. 

Ex: Why would I wish for someone's happiness even after I die? I don't expect to be satisfied by their happiness when I'm dead anyway.

I think that there's not much reason to give up on common sense view. That we actually love other people. We want them to be happy. We also hate other people and want them to be sad, but we have these, these feelings toward other people that don't reduce the feelings towards themselves, towards ourselves. 

Evolution does work by, through the sort of relentless propagation of genes. But, evolution could build brains that really care about other people.

 >> Okay, so what about the other side, the other end of the spectrum?
So, if so this question comes from Elizabeth Metraux, and she says well if a psychopath's lack of empathy can cloud his moral judgment, what about someone who is super empathetic who's at the other end of the spectrum. Can they cloud their judgment?

Can you have too much empathy? Is there an opposite of a psychopath? Now some people think the opposite of a psychopath would be a tremendously good person. The, the psychologist Simon Baron Cohen talks about different extremes, the psychopath is the worst person in the world with no empathy, no caring. But then you have people on the other side of the world, highly empathetic, and their wonderful people, their terrific people.

I disagree, I think if you have too much empathy, it can paralyze you. If you care too much for people viscerally, it, it makes you unable to act and sometimes makes you irrational. Stephen Pinker has a nice example in his book, Better Angels of Our Nature. He says, you see a kid, and the kid's terrified by a howling dog and the kid's weeping and screaming Well, what's, what's your best moral act? Well, to have out the kid. To pick up the kid, to reassure the kid. But if you're super empathetic and, and you start losing it, and you start weeping and screaming, you're useless. 

__I also think that too much empathy will cause you to overvalue the suffering of one, one person in front of you. Often at the expense of the suffering of many, who you don't see.__ So I think for empathy, I'm against empathy as a policy choice. But I think, you know, everyone wants to have, sort of, a decent amount of empathy, but too much can be as bad as too little. 

>> Okay, next question is an anonymous question posed in the forum. What do you think about the rise of sort of, the Internet and other kinds of technology how has that contributed to our moral behavior?

It's a hard question, because there's no doubt one could point to the internet and, and point to terrible things that happen over the internet. Cyberbullying various forms of social attack and social ostracism brutal acts that are then videotaped and put online. And it's also not hard to see that there's all sorts of things on the internet that really improves people's lives. 

And so there's a lot of good and bad I'll make an observation, which is people often think the world is going to hell, things are getting worse and worse. But as Pinker talks, we'll talk about this later on in the class, that since for the last many, many years violent crime has been dropping. Certainly in America, the homicide rate has dropped by about half, over the last 30 years. robbery, rape, assault, all of them have been dropping. 

I guess what I would think is that internet could accelerate different appetites we have. If one is cruel or sadistic or somehow troubled, the internet can help people unleash their worst instincts. But its also an enormous mechanism for altruism and kindness and, and you know, one can think about online donations and so on. 

But I kind of think of little things like sometimes on the discussion board somebody says I have a problem with this quiz or can somebody help me do this. People immediately chime in to help, and that's extraordinary. I mean, is it extraordinary that, that people will do this though they get no reward. And I think the internet has become, in some way, a mechanism through which people could express all sorts of kindness. 

And one thing the internet seems to do, is is connects in a way that wasn't possible before the rise of the internet. Maybe that is having some effect on expanding the group of people that we can be empathetic towards or kind towards. 

I think that's right and it's not just numbers. It's range. So, before the Internet, I might know a lot of people, but it's kind of all people from my neighborhood. They'll all be people I encounter. But now we get to encounter people on the discussion boards, right now, on those questions. Who, live in far away countries, who, who, who are, we would never encounter, in any other way. So it's really quite extraordinary.

>> So Matt asks, do you think that ethics and morality professors, having studied a lot of these issues about what's the best moral philosophy, what's moral psychology really like. Are they better people than average?

I've argued in these lectures, is that the power of reason, the power of deliberations. __So these people who do more reasoning for a living you'd expect to be really nice people. Sadly, the answer's probably no.__ There's actually research done on this, where you, you, you do all sorts of studies on ethics professors and you compare them to other philosophers, you can compare them to chemistry professors, you can compare them to people who aren't professors at all. And the truth of it, they aren't nicer, really. So one study found that, they're much more likely to say That they care about animal rights and be vegetarians. But then when you ask them what they actually do and what they eat, they're not any more likely to, to you know, be vegetarians, they just think it's a good thing. 

Then there was another study which was very cool where they asked people including ethics professors, do you think you should respond to student email? So if a student sends you an email and says I'm having problems with the course or I want some advice, do you think you should respond? And many of the ethics professors said yes. It is a moral imparitive to respond to somebody who seeks, reach out to you in good faith. What the professors didn't know was for the last year they had been the subject of an experiment. Where the experimenters sent them emails coming from students. And it turned out a lot of professors who said this was an important moral imperative, actually didn't answer student emails. So, not so much.

>> Okay so Leah Cohen asks, what's your opinion about morality being relative? So is there a consequence of these various things like emotions, disgust, culture that can change over time and from place to place. It seems like maybe morality is subjective. You know sort of there are various systems that can be considered right.

So it's a deep question. What do we think of morality. I tend towards the realist side so, so the question is correct that, that we are swayed by all sorts of arbitrary and accidental facts of our culture, of our emotions, and you think that that makes it all kind of relative, but at the same time. We also could use reason and logic and argument. We could say this is a goal we want to achieve, say happiness in most people. And then we could argue and think our way through on how to solve it. And so in some way I make an analogy with science, say astronomy. So astronomers study planets and stars and the structure of our universe. And, when they do this, they are subject to their biases, their ambitions, their political prejudices, their religious beliefs, their mor, everything sways them in all different ways. Yet still, they make discoveries. They discover truths and so I think in morality, we can do the same thing.

>> Which is from Dimitra Bacicu, who asks Is it normal that since I've hear the views of Peter Singer, I feel guilty for everything bad that's going on in the world?

Yes, if, if, you, if, if you believe Singer's argument, you should feel intense guilt. If you live like me, in some degree of luxury and spending money on things you don't need, if Singer is correct, you, you, you should feel bad. You're doing something wrong. You're not literally killing people, but you're close. You're, you're, if you did something different you'd be saving lives and you're choosing not to. 

Now, some people hear this and say well Singer can't be right. I don't want to be that uncomfortable. But that's not a good argument, that's not a good argument to say that if the conclusion is true, I'd be upset. So it can't be true. You've got to look at the argument. And I'm persuaded enough by what Pete, Peter Singer says, that has changed my life in some regards and I'm persuaded enough to think that And persuaded enough to still feel guilty about the life I lead. 

A lot of more people are like Louis C.K. So even if you hear the view of Peter Singer. Even if you sort of really engage with it and then let it affect you as I think Louis C.K. seems to have done. He's still,you know, driving around in his car. You know, doing the same thing that [CROSSTALK] he's always been doing. And I think that that's sort of the, the typical response is just denial, just head in the sand. That's really bad, I don't want to think about that conclusion and if I did it would make me feel terribly guilty. 

I think you're right, I mean, as peop, anybody who's been on discussion boards will know. That the, the, the reading the assignment that generates by far the most discussion was, Sam Harris's Ted talk. But Sam Harris is not the most controversial resource I've used in my courses. I often assign something by Peter Singer. I assign an article he wrote, where he says that the wealthy people of the world are doing something horrible, by not giving away their resources to the poor. And the response I get from students in my classes, is not, oh I feel so guilty, it's what a jerk. It's rage. Rage or indifference or something must have gone wrong. And so it's true to answer literally it is actually not that normal to feel that guilty. But I think we should if we're convinced by the argument feel that guilty.

## 3 - 1 - 3.1 - Moral Diversity - 9_32

Now in this third lecture, we're going to start at the origins of morality. The origins of moral rules and moral principes and moral feelings. Where do they come from? How is it that we have them? 

So, in this first lecture, I'm going to spend the rest of the lecture talking about moral diversity, that it's differences in moral feeling and moral judgments. The second lecture we'll talk about moral universals that is aspects of morality that are shared across all humans. The third and fourth lectures we'll deal with evolution and morality. Looking at morality from a biological, Darwinian perspective. Asking how the amoral force of natural selection could give rise to creatures like us, which have moral capacity for moral judgements, altruistic behavior and all sort of other directive, all sorts of sweeter kinder emotions and feelings. The fifth lecture is a guest lecture by professor Lori Santos, who's a colleague and a friend of mine. And she'll be talking about primate morality. Then we'll go back and the sixth lecture will be about morality in babies. And, finally we'll end with some open questions, some puzzles, some things that honestly we have not, solved yet, and maybe we, we're not ready to solve. 

But, I want to be honest in this course and sort of lay out what we know and sometimes what we don't know. So, diversity, many people are skeptical of moral universes. So, when you say I'm interested in morality, one, one, one reasonable response is, well, morality differs all over the place. There's nothing universal about morality. We have one moral system, but people in another country might have another, and people at another time might have another. And, this idea of moral diversity, is something which has been in the air a long time. 

One classic example is, from, comes from Heredades who wrote in his histories about 2,400 hundred years ago. And, Heredades tells a story of Darius, King of Persia. So, to make a point, Darius brings in a bunch of Greeks. And he says to them, so how much would I have to pay you to eat the dead bodies of your fathers? And, the Greeks are horrified. They would never do such a thing. What a, what a grotesque proposal! How wrong can you be? And then, in a Presidents of the Greeks, Darius brought in some members of an Indian tribe, but a very different custom. And, ask them, how much would I have to give you to burn the bodies of your fathers? And, the Indians were horrified. How could we do such a thing? The only thing you do to respect one's dead father would be to eat him. You don't burn him. And, and the point that Darius is making to his audience was, that what seems natural to one is unnatural to another. What seems right to one is wrong to another. Haradus goes on to write, if anyone were given the opportunity from choosing amongst all of the nations in the world, the set of beliefs which he thought best, he would inevitably, after careful consideration of irrelative merits, choose that of his own country. Everyone without exception believes his own native customs and the religion he was brought in to be the best. 

Now, many contemporary psychologists, philosophers, anthropologist would agree with the point that Horradis is making, which is that there's significant variation And morality around the world. And, my favorite example here is from the University of Chicago anthropologist Richard Shweder, who provides a very nice list. So, he's talking about moral attitudes and moral feelings. And, he notices that people have found it quite naturally to be spontaneously appalled, outraged, indignant, proud, disgusted, guilty, ashamed of all sorts of things. And he has this list that you could see. Masturbation, homosexuality, democracy, capitalism, meat eating, divorce, romantic love, marriage, long hair, women being allowed to work, women not being allowed to work, and the range is dazzling and it's correct. For each of these items you could find some people in the world who find it monstrous and other people in the world who find it important, and significant, and valuable. 

One could see these differences, without going to an anthropological text or without reading history books, is open up the newspaper. So, one story, that, that I found in the New York Times as I was thinking about these issues and writing about these issues, was, was this, this very sad case in Afghanistan. So, you have two teenagers, and they're of different ethnicities, different groups, and they fall in love. And they, they start to date, they start to talk to each other. One day, in the middle of the day, they're sitting in a car together and their talking, and a group of men see them and approach them and demand to know what their doing there. What's up with them, are they involved, what's happening here? And, pretty soon people gather and 300 people gathered, and they decide that these 2 teenagers are adulterers. They're, they're, they're involved in a, in a sexual relationship outside of marriage. And they decide to, to kill them, to kill them through stoning. And, then security forces come, the police comes and there's a riot. Police come, they rescue the teens, they put them in custody for their own protection and there's a riot and one person dies. Now, after the event all sorts of people came and express their moral attitudes. But, their moral attitudes weren't necessarily what one would expect. so, the father of the girl says, well, this is terrible, this is a horrible thing, both people should be killed. Both the teenagers should be killed for what they did. the, the, the family members of the man who was killed in the riot says, it's the teenage girls responsibility, and here's what she can do to make good, what she can do is, marry one of their remaining sons, and then the debt will be paid. 

Now, from how I was raised, I, you know, I was raised in Montreal, Canada. I was, I now, now, now live in the United states. These are very alien moral sentiments. I was raised in a, in, in a community in a world where romantic love was prized. Romantic love was seen as a, as a precious and important thing. One might object to it in some case and not others, but nothing inherently wrong with it. And, so it's shocking to me to see how people are different. In fact and contemporary Western society, many could argue we are going to opposite extreme where there are sort of a celebration of sexual debotury, hardcore pornography is rampance. Some would argue that the objectification of women as sexual objects is rampant. And, and this is which, and, and these are, are, things that are viewed as morally okay in the West but shocking and repellent to many people around the world. So, it's clear enough that people at different places in different times have very different moral views. This leads the question, what if anything, do we have in common? And that's the topic of the next lecture.

## 3 - 2 - 3.2 - Moral Universals - 13_23

So we ended in the last lecture by talking about diversity, the sort of diversity pointed out by Herodotus, the sort of diversity cataloged by Richard Shweder and other anthropologists. But, now we can kind of shift gears a bit and think about things in a different way, looking now at what places and people have in common. And the first thing to realize is that the examples provided by Herodotus and by Shweder and others actually illustrate a sort of commonality. 

Because, although cultures have different attitudes about how to treat the dead, about how parents should interact with their kids, about romantic love, about sexuality. Although they have different attitudes, there are no cultures that don't care. These are all examples of, of moral differences, but they're also examples of moral commonalities, and these are the very domains which are imbued with morality. So, so, you know, you might have to. You, you. The right thing might be to eat your dead father. The right thing might be to burn your dead father. It might be to, as in our culture, many of us, to bury your dead father. But you're not going to find anybody who says, I don't care. Whatever, you know? Dead bodies? Who cares. Humans care about dead bodies. Humans care deeply about the moral status of dead bodies, of loved ones, and what one should do about them. 

You may find societies that treasure romantic love. That view this as a high moral ideal. Others that view it as very disturbing and wrong. Well, you're not going to find cultures that say love, that doesn't really matter from a moral point of view, couldn't care. These are things that matter. More to the point. It's not the case that everything's up for grabs. 

So, we're naturally fascinated by moral differences. And we're actually fascinated by these in part because they matter to us as we travel and as we interact with other people. When I go to a foreign land, I'm very interested in in how they think, and I'm particularly interested in how they think that's different from how I think. Is the way I raise my kids going to be shocking to them? Are they going to be offended by something I do? Are our customs different? Are our, you know, rules for interaction different? We want to know that because we're people, and when we're interacting with other people it's the differences that matter. I don't want to open up a travel guide and say, you know this far away place you're going? The people there, they have noses, and they age over time. Well. And they often have two arms and two legs. I don't want to hear that. That's not humanly interesting because I know it's true. It's just obvious. 

Arguably, you see the same thing with language. So, the linguist, Noam Chomsky, has pointed out that the thing that captivates us with languages are their differences. If I go to a foreign land, and they're speaking French or Thai or Choctaw or Russian, or what have you, I don't understand any of those languages. And the difference between what they're doing and what I do, speaking English, barely, is, is, is, is it humanly relevant? And Chomsky points out though, that it turns out languages have deep universals. The deep universals underline language and may in some way be the sort of much more important from a scientific point of view than their superficial differences. But it's not the universals we focus on. It's the differences, and you might say the same thing with morality. So, there are moral universals that show up culture after culture after culture. We tend not to think of them or talk about them because they aren't as humanly relevant. In some sense they aren't as exotic. They aren't as interesting. 

But what am I talking about, when I talk about human universals? Well, here we could draw upon the work of scholars like, like Shweder himself. Like his his student and a psychologist, Jonathan Haidt. Psychologists like Pinker and, and, and anthros, anthropologists like Fisk who have, who have sort of broken up the moral the moral world into different parts, and without putting too much weight onto this I want to suggest you can think about five categories when it comes to morality. 

So one category is harm. Harm is a critical universal aspect of our moral systems, and in particular, wherever you go, there's the belief in the wrongness of intentional assault. You gotta have a reason. To put it differently. Wherever you travel, anywhere on this planet, if you walk up to somebody and punched them in the face, you better have a good reason. You better, you better, you better have an excuse. There better be a justification. Because otherwise the people are not going to stand for that. You will have done something wrong. 

There's reciprocity. Humans are social beings. We find ourselves in, in, in relationships where we share, where we cooperate, and there are norms of sharing and cooperation saying how you should do it, who you should do it with and so on. 

There's also corta, correspondingly a universal notion that it's wrong to cheat. It's wrong to say you'll do something and not do it. It's wrong to to, to, you know, weasel out of things. It's wrong to free-ride. Well, free-ride is a bit of a, a technical term. To, to be a free-rider means you mooch off the hard work of others. There is a hunt, for instance, and everybody in the community is doing the hunting. And you're sitting back. And when the food comes you eat as much of it as everybody else. Well, there is no place on earth where if they notice, people notice this, they won't think that you're a jerk. That sort of free riding is universally disapproved of. 

There's hierarchy, and this is actually a domain which we probably know a little bit less about than some of these other domains. But the idea is, wherever you look, there's some respect for authority, some notion of honor and dignity and respect. And, now this could be very rich. So in a society where I live in, there is all sorts of hierarchies. I'm supposed to respect the president, I'm supposed to respect my boss. My, my students are supposed to respect me to varying degrees. but, but everywhere, there's something like this. At minimum, within the family. Where our sort of expectations and requirements about how a child is supposed to deal with his or her parents, and the parents are supposed to deal with his or her children. 

There's purity. Purity is extremely interesting and, and, and one way to put this, and this actually comes from, from Shweder, to some extent. Is that wherever you are you find it morally important to protect yourself and others from contamination, physical or spiritual. I know it's a little bit vague. And, and this is something which I find interesting enough I want to devote more time to it later but now just, just to, to sort of zoom in a little bit. Wherever you go there's going to be moral restrictions having to do with food and sex and death. It's not just like oh, we like to eat this and not that or, or we think this sexual position is particularly fantastic or, you know, don't step on the corpse. Rather, it's. It is wrong to eat this. It is right to eat that, or it's wrong to eat this on that day of the week or that time of the year. This sort of sex is forbidden. This sort of sex is morally out of bounds. When somebody dies you should do this and that and this and that, and not do this and that and this and that. The details, of course, as we've discussed differ but there are to my knowledge from anything I've read, there are no societies who are indifferent about these matters of purity. 

And finally, there's some issue, there's always a morality of community. We make a moral, we make a distinction between in-groups and out-groups, between us and them. And this isn't just a psychological distinction, this isn't just that we notice it, but rather this distinction has moral significance. There's a value given to loyalty to your group. We condemn people who betray their group. We condemn heretics. We condemn people who, who defect to the other group. And a lot of our sort of group dynamics, a lot, a lot of the way the world works. Turns on the critical and natural moral distinctions they make between themselves and other people. 

So, you have these universals and in, in fact we, we could now, just, just to look at in a somewhat different way, forget about the categories and, and think of specific examples. So these are specific examples, which I would suggest are true everywhere. There's a ban on arbitrary assaults. No punching somebody wihtout a good reason. You should keep promises. When you make a, a promise to someone, you say you'll do something, you should. If you just, you know, don't do it, then something's gone wrong. Some degree of sexual modesty. Now this of course, varies hugely. There are parts of the world where a man, you know, if, if he's not going out with a vest and a nice jacket and a tie, he, you know, he's doing something horribly wrong. There's other parts of the world where he just has to have a penis pouch, and that's it. 

But, there's always rules. There's rules on some degree of, of modesty. Regarding how much of your body you show, and also regarding where you urinate and defecate, and where you have sexual intercourse. It doesn't, you're not going to find any people for whom this doesn't matter. Some obligation to share. At least share with those with your children. With, with your friends. Anger towards cheaters and free-riders. Anger towards those who for whatever reason have chosen to violate the moral rule that you would hoped that they would do. And they don't share. Protection of children. Just like there's no society, where you can't punch somebody just at will, there's no society where it's fine to kill children. A taboo on incest. So, there's a particular sexual taboo, that gets sketched out in different ways, but but wherever you go for instance brother-sister incest is considered morally wrong. It's not just oh we don't like that, we don't typically do it but rather it, there's something wrong with it. If, if, if it was believed, if you came into this country and you said, oh this is what I do all the time I have intercourse with my siblings, people would look down on you. There are rules about appropriate foods. There's obligation to family, and finally, to go back to Herodotus, there's special treatment of the dead. 

Now, you have these universal moral principles, these universal moral ideas and it might be very tempting to say wow, so that must be hardwired. That must be innate. That must be a part of how our brains work. That must be the product of natural selection, of biological evolution. But it doesn't necessarily follow. All sorts of things that are universal could arise in the course of cultural evolution, not biological evolution. That is, they could be cultural solutions to universal problems. So take the, the restriction against hitting. It might be an effect, I think I will argue that, that, that it is. That there's some built in mechanism that, that, that kicks in when you see one person arbitrarily assault another one. 

But, to be fair, there are other theories for why all societies have some sort of ban on hitting. The idea being that even if you didn't start off with any instinctive desire not to be hit or not to have somebody hit another person, still the culture couldn't survive if you would just hit each other. So imagine two societies side by side. One society, people just smacked each other whenever they felt like it. The other society, where it was viewed as wrong to do so. It's clear the society which views it wrong to do so would be a better society will, will, will work better, will be better at, at battle, will be better at everything. Then a society where people were just simply smacking each other. 

The philosopher Jesse Prinz, put this quite nicely, quite succinctly, when he wrote how would society work if you could punch your neighbor regularly? __Well, not very well. so, we should, as we consider the origins of these universals, we should have on the table that some of this morality might arise as cultural solutions to universal problems.__ At the same time, though, what I want to suggest is that some of morality has a different origin. In particular, some of morality may have evolved through natural selection. And how this can happen, how this can work, is going to be the topic of the next couple of lectures.

## 3 - 3 - 3.3 - Evolution of Morality - 20_19

So I want to turn now and talk about morality from a evolutionary perspective. Now I'd like to assume some familiarity with the theory of natural selection. And if people want to get more of a background, as part of the supplementary readings I linked to an excellent video that outlines the logic and, and, and some examples of how natural selection works. If you're not familiar with the evolutionary theory behind it, it's absolutely fascinating and you should delve into it. I would actually also recommend reading Origin of Species. Actually the first edition, Darwin's first edition. Darwin was among so many other things, a lovely writer. And he wrote for a broad audience. And this is an accessible and interesting book. 

If you want something more contemporary, I would suggest Richard Dawkins's wonderful book, The Blind Watchmaker. I think this is the British cover. I read this when I was much younger and it actually totally entranced me. And largely transformed my intellectual life, getting me to take very seriously evolution and evolutionary theory, later on influencing my own work as a psychologist. It just, it's just a, a wonderful read. 

But in case, in case, you don't have the background. A very short summary of the theory which has a sort of surprising simplicity and surprising elegance goes like this. It involves three parts. There are three three conditions that are needed for natural selection to take place. You have to have variation. You have to have differential reproduction, meaning that some of the variants do better at reproducing than others. And you have to have heredity, where the offspring resemble their parents. 

And Darwin's extraordinary insight is, you take these three simple facts when they occur. __Variation, differential reproduction and heredity.__ And under those conditions such things can give rise to the most complicated and extraordinary systems in the universe. It could give rise to biological life. It could give rise to animals, and parts of animals and organs and all sorts of good things like that. 

So, a very simple example, a sort of toy example, would be like this, which is, you could say you could ask yourself, Why is it that all? Imagine, it turns out to be the case, that the beetles are brown, and, and birds don't eat brown beetles. They can't see them, or whatever. Say, wow, how did that work out? How did that happen? Well, one argument would be, one, one explanation is that maybe beetles started off both green and brown, so you get this variation, some are green, some are brown. But, there is differential reproduction, there is differential reproduction because birds eat the green beetles. And so the green beetles leave behind fewer offspring than the brown beetles. Now there is also, as a third component, heredity. So the brown beetles give rise to offspring that tend to be brown. They resemble their parents. If you iterate this over and over again, and this is actually simple example, you're not going to need a computer model to, you to see it. Pretty soon all the beetles going to be brown. Pretty soon in a condition where there's variant x and variant y, and x does better than y, leaves more offspring. Pretty soon, x will win and the whole population will be, will be x. 

And this is a screamingly simple example, but, you know, the project, so much of the project of evolutionary biology is wrapping this up. So forget now about a single color difference and think about camouflage. And and, and the same evolutionary explanation can explain why animals, why some animals are so extraordinarily good at blending into their environments. They're good at blending into their environments because, variants, you go back into the past. Variants that were better off at blending in got eaten less by predators. And then, and so on and so forth and so on, until through, you gradually converge on animals that are almost invisible, because they got to be invisible because those invisible variants, those variants that perfectly blended in reproduced the most. And then you get to, to, to sort of detailed analyses of how this sort of increasing, step by step by step, each step leading to some, perhaps a minuscule, but a real advantage in reproductive success. Leads to a, a, a new stage of development. 

And then so they're biological theories well grounded in data on how the eye could evolve. How the how the leg of a horse could evolve. How whole animals could evolve, how the spine could evolve. And and so this is all the biological part. But it slides into psychology because one of the, the, the organs that have evolved, that has evolved through natural selection is of course, the brain and in particular, organ we are most interested is the human brai, human brain. And if you see the human brain as a biological adaptation, as something which has risen through natural selection. That's just quite a new way of looking at things. And this was something Darwin himself was sensitive to. 

So one point he writes, that as a result of evolutionary theory, psychology will be based on a new foundation. That of the necessary acquirement via evolution of each mental power and capacity by gradation. That is, you look at the cluster of mental capacities we have and each one we can see as an adaptation that has sort of gradually developed through increased reproductive success. 

Now this is a certain view of the mind. It doesn't say the mind is a huge all purpose computer or the mind is a general associative network as many philosophers would argue. And some modern day computational theorists would argue. But rather, the mind is a cluster of different capacities. Each one has evolved for a different purpose. Also, they've evolved to work in concert with one another. This is, again, an old idea. The most one of the most famous psychologists of all, William James, expressed it quite nicely. William James wrote. It is often said that man is distinguished from the lower animals by having a much smaller assortment of native instincts and impulses than they, but this is a great mistake. 

James's point is it's very tempting just to say, oh, animals are the product of biological evolution. There's a bunch of instincts that they possess that guide them to, to various behaviors. But humans are special. Humans, we don't have instincts anymore, we're just very smart. We're cultural creatures, say. And to some extent we are very smart and to some extent we are cultural creatures. But the approach that Darwin and James recommend, an approach which is pursued by many evolutionary psychologists. An approach which, you know, guides my own research is that in addition to any general smartness any cultural proclivities that we posses, we also have an assortment of, of instincts, call them mental organs, call them modules. For language, for mate selection, for rudiment, rudimentary mathematics, for social interaction. These may be in different parts of the brain. They may be re, re. They are clearly related to one another and they each have their own evolutionary history shaped by natural selection. 

So, you, you, you think of the human brain now as a product of natural selection as a set of instincts or organs. And, and, and, and it's easy enough to explain, to see how this approach can explain certain appetites, like food and sex. So why do we get hungry. Well, you get hungry because it motivates us to eat, and any ancestors we had that was that weren't motivated to eat would die and wouldn't reproduce, this is why animals get hungry. Why do we eat this and not that? Well that gets a little bit more interesting. We can kind learn about the details of our appetites. Details of what we like to eat and what we like to drink by looking at evolutionary benefits that, that exist when we eat this and not that. 

What turns us on? What about sex? Well, same thing. Any animal that wasn't actively involved in the project of reproduction, wouldn't reproduce. And it for the most part for the most there's a lot of competition for reproductive resources. Either getting to reproduce at all, or getting to reproduce with the best possible mate to get the best possible genes. And so, and this is not the topic of this course but it would be a great other course. So any serious inquiry into the psychology of human sexuality will be guided, at least in part, by a clear headed look at how evolution would have shaped us sexually. How it would have shaped our desires, our strategies, and our behaviors. But, you might worry, and through history a lot of people have worried, that this evolutionary approach is perfectly good when it comes to sort of so-called selfish desires. 

You know eating, and having sex, and protecting yourself and so on. But morality isn't about the self primarily. Morality is about the welfare of others. And how could a evolutionary process driven by survival and reproduction lead to caring about the welfare of others? So some people say about, about animals that according to natural selection, according to evolutionary theory, we're survival machines. And it's hard to think of anything more amoral than that. Or well, okay, how about survival of the fittest? Which is, which is you know, a sort of savage, amoral, perhaps immoral doctrine. Nature red in tooth and claw. An idea here is that if you think about human nature from a, you know, a clear headed, cold-blooded biological, natural selection point of view, there's no place for morality. So to the extent that we are moral creatures, to the extent we can do right and wrong, we can think about right and wrong, that has to be separate from morality. 

Maybe it was instilled within us by God. Maybe, it was a cultural invention that we came up with with our powerful intelligence, but it cannot be natural. Now, I don't think these worries are entirely mistaken. I think certain claims about our moral nature, certain idealistic views about what morality could be. As part of us, are really precluded by the facts of biological evolution. So, imagine genes that gave rise to an indiscriminate altruist. 

So I'll describe my terms. I'll define my terms. Altruism is the act of giving to somebody at a cost to yourself. An indiscriminate altruist is someone who gives to everybody. Doesn't care, just gives to anybody. How would this indiscriminate altruist do? Well, if there's a community of indiscriminate altruists, we all just give indiscriminately to everybody else, we could do pretty well actually. There's all sorts of things in life where you could use somebody's help watching over a child. Moving something that's heavy, collecting food. And if everybody helps everybody else, it's really to the sort of mutual benefit of the whole society. 

But here's the problem. Imagine such a society of indiscriminate altruists and now imagine a mutant. Imagine another creature pops in who receives but never gives. So, takes any food anybody gives to it you want to watch your kids that's fine, but itself is not implying to, to do anything to help other people. To help other members of its species. It's not hard to see that this mutant would have a huge advantage. Suppose every time, suppose take a, take a concrete example warning cries. So some animals give warning cries when a predator approaches, so a predator's in the distance, I see it and I scream warning, warning. I don't scream warning warning, I scream some sort, I can't, I can't imitate a warning cry that any animal would do. A human warning cry. Hey, warning. Suppose I'm an indiscriminate altruist. So I just do this no matter what, whoever is around me. Now, imagine this mutant. And everybody benefits from me. Even though when I shout out the warning cry, it raises my own risk because it calls my attention to the predator. So, the benefit to everybody is great, but there's some risks, risks to myself. And, if everybody was like me, the trade off would work out well. But now again, a mutant comes in, who gets all the benefit. He listens to warning cries and runs away. But, when he sees a predator, he just runs away. Doesn't do a warning cry at all. He would do better. He would live longer. He would reproduce more. Which means is nice guys finish last. Pure kindness of an indiscriminate sort can't evolve. 
Okay but now we get a little bit more subtle. What about genes that give rise to a discriminate altruist? A discriminate altruist is somebody who, who acts in a way to help others, and takes cost to help others. But is discriminating, helps some but not everybody. 

Well we actually know that discriminate altruists. exist. We know animals are discriminate altruists. Take the simplest case of caring for your children. So animals, mammals, for instance, take care of their offspring. Sometimes female mammals will feed their offspring from their own bodies. Mammals will watch over them, will take care of them, will, will, provide them with food once they're born, before they're born and so on. And this is, they don't do this to everybody. They do this to, to their offspring. So you know, one example is as everyone uses cute animals but one example is vampire bats. So vampire bats, when a vampire bat will fly out of its cave, find a horse or something, bite the horse get in a lot of blood. More blood then itself needs. Fly back to the cave and then regurgitate this blood into the mouths of its baby vampire bats. And, and you could see this sort of altruism being beneficial and, and it's a kindness, but it's not the sort of pure, indiscriminate kindness. 

One way to think about this, the term people use to describe the phenomenon that I've been introducing is kin selection. And the idea is this, you have a specific gene for something, what's going to make that gene a winner? What's going to make the gene such that it's going to spread through a population. And before you know it everyone's going to have the gene. Well one answer is, it might increase the chance that the bearer of that gene will survive and reproduce. If there is a gene that makes me resistant to a disease like malaria, and my next door neighbor does not have that gene I will do better. I will reproduce more. My neighbor will reproduce less. And over the fullness of time everybody will have this gene because this gene just leads to an advantage. 

But a gene could also spread if it increases the chance that other individuals who possess that gene, genetic relatives, will survive and reproduce. So. Imagine gene A makes animals care for its siblings and gene B makes animals only care for itself. Since if you only care for your siblings, your gene A your siblings also have some chance of having gene A in them. And so by active sort of caring for your kin, genes get to replicate themselves. And so the, the logic of this was, was presented in a somewhat comical way by the biologist Haldane. Haldane was asked presumably, it's one of these stories that, that sounds apocryphal but may well have been true. He was asked in a bar, just casual conversation, would you lay down your life for your brother? Made a few quick calculations and responded, no, but I would gladly give my life for three brothers or five nephews or nine first cousins. 

Now what he was doing in a whimsical way, we never do this consciously, was making reference to to the degree of genetic relatedness. So as you can see in this chart over here different relatives are related to you to different degrees. And related to you in this sense means what are the odds that for any gene you possess that they also possess that gene. So with me and my identical twin. If I were to have an identical twin, it'd go up to about 100%. For me and my sibling, about 50%, and so on. So we could unpack Haldane's answer. Would you lay down your life for your brother who has 50% of your genes? No. But, I would give my life for three brothers, because that's 150%. Or five nephews, 125%, or nine first cousins, 112.5%. Nobody actually, again, nobody does these calculations in their heads but the idea is that the logic here, the fact that these strategies. Lead the strategies of, of a certain form of discriminate altruism towards close genetically related kin, lead to greater success of genes has shaped our psychologies and it's this psy, these shape psychologies that leads to, sort of, moral sentiments. Towards people close to us. 

This is if you defended, at great length again by Richard Dawkins in his wonderful book, The Selfish Gene. And The Selfish Gene is one of these books that people always misunderstand. And, and the people who misunderstand are often the people who simply look at the cover. And, and, and, and, and misread things. So often, they say, oh, Dawkins is saying people are selfish. But actually, Dawkins is actually saying exactly the opposite. He's saying genes are selfish, in the metaphorical sense, he's very clear it's a metaphor, that all they want to do, metaphor again, is make copies of themselves, replicate themselves, spread through the population. But, because genes are selfish people aren't selfish. That is to the extent that evolution operates at the level of the genes there's no hard and fast distinction between oneself and another. Before you think of things in terms of genes you might think you're one individual with its own interests. And everybody else is their own individual with their own interests. But from the genetic point of view, there's no sharp line. Your interests are, are the same, genetically, as two of your brothers'interests. Genes cross-cut things in different ways, and a genetic perspective on human nature, interestingly enough can provide our first understanding of where morality can come from.

## 3 - 4 - 3.4 - Reciprocal Altruism - 18_56

Would altruism/indiscriminate altruists not work if there were cheaters in the system? How can we know which people are altruistic or not?

Priosner's dilemma. It turns out that prisoner's dilemma show up, all over daily life. All over interactions with other people. I'll give you a few examples, just to illustrate this. Divorce thing, hiring a lawyer = more expense. Countries investing in war over education. Buying drugs you can bring a gun to a meetup regardless if you're the dealer or the buyer.

By the logic of the prisoners' dilemma. So, this seems terrible. It seems like a situation, which shows up over and over again, in the real world. Where brute logic, sort of, forces you to a conclusion that is less than optimal, for everybody. 

If we can play over and over again though, one strategy always wins, Tit-for-Tat. Computers win using this strat, and it turns out humans use this strat too. A lot of friendship is about you're nice to me, I feel I want to be nice to you, and we get along. We have this mutual trading back and forth. We feel anger and distrust towards those who betray us. When people betray too much, you don't want to play with them anymore.

## 3 - 5 - 3.5 - Guest Lecture, Laurie Santos - 1_10_14

I thought I'd start with a little bit of a historical perspective today. So imagine if you will with me, you are a resident of New Haven, but not a member of the modern day. Somebody who lived back, back in the days, so back about 350 years ago in a New Haven colony, back in the 1600s.

This one guy who's enlabeled here as Mister. Potter. We're told that he's 50 years of age. Less information, though, about the other eight conspirators who were involved. They're just listed as a cow, two heifers, three sheep, and two sows. You might be thinking, what on earth crime did the set of nine conspirators commit, and then you look to the crime that's listed and you say oh, yep, makes a little bit of sense. But these are individuals who put on crime for the damnable crime of bestiality. Now, if you're like me with my modern eyes, you might be looking at this sort of crime and all the conspirators who are put to death. And you might look at the list and think you know, I bet of the nine conspirators there's sort of one mastermind of the whole bestiality thing. 

And of Mr. Potter, they say the following things: he was a good dude, he was devout in worship, gifted in prayer, he was zealous in reforming the sins of other people, apparently not of other animals, but he was, you know, a totally honorable guy. It was the other eight conspirators who folks thought, that were an issue here. They, it is said, were of, they were unclean devils, and they were in fact diabolically possessed. So diabolically possessed it's thought that they used their, their demonic possession to sort of convince, and seduce and tempt this otherwise innocent guy who had to be put to the gallows because he went along with this damnable crime. 

And so, this strikes our modern eyes as very, very funny. But it shouldn't, in part because you think this is some sort of rare event that I pulled out of the terrible annals of weird New Haven history. __In fact, fact of the matter is, back in the 1600s, pre-Enlightenment, there were lots of odd cases of animals being put on trial.__ Put to death and so on. So this wasn't an unusual thing back 300 years ago. But it strikes us as really unusual. And so today, we want to contemplate why. What changed that made this feel really weird? 

Well, I want to submit that it's, it's not the reason you might suspect. It's not because animals have all of a sudden become much more angelic, and less tempting, right? You know, they're, if you have a dog or cat at home, you know they're just as diabolical, perhaps, as, you know, animals 300 years ago. I also want to submit that it's not the other reason that you might think. Which is that we've become a little bit less barbaric in our ways of capital punishment. Because, as many of you know, in fact, at least in this country, this is not something that we've become less barbaric about. In fact, one of the current moralities of everyday life that I think folks struggle with is what to do with this and whether this is morally appropriate. And just as a sort of editor's note aside, if you're an undergraduate who cares about these issues, you might want to talk to the Yale democrats who are petitioning Connecticut to get rid of their death penalty which is still on the books. 

But, that's just my my little aside. Getting back to the real matter at hand, what was it that changed that makes capital punishment of animals on the New Haven Green seem weird? __Well, what I want to submit is that one of the things at least that's changed is that we seem to have a slightly different post enlightenment view of the moral status of animals. And, I want to submit that the view that we have is, in some ways, a little bit worse then what we had before.__

Because, the view that we have now is incredibly conflicted. At times we seem quite confused about what we think the moral status of animals really actually is. And when I speak about the moral status of animals, I'm actually not talking about one status that you might be thinking of, which is animals in the status of moral patients. Organisms to whom we might want to decide whether to give moral concerns. This is of course, a controversial and very conflicted issue for us, we can debate about whether it's okay and permissible to use animals as food, as experimental subjects, and so on, but that's not the confusing issue I'm going to deal with. 

__The confusing issue I am going to try to deal with is our perception of animals as moral agents, individuals not necessarily who can be punished or so on, but individuals like us who might have moral concerns.__ In particular who might have psychological maybe neuromechanisms to actually deal with questions of whether something is appropriate or good or permissible or punishable. And these are the kinds of concerns I'm going to ask about today, and the view that I'm going to develop is that we seem to today have a somewhat conflicted view about what we think animal's moral concerns are, if they have any. 

And I'll start with this confusion by sort of turning to Charles Darwin, who was one of the first to sort of think about this issue, this idea of whether animals have moral concerns, and what they might look like, because he and his first writings on this sort of bears the hallmarks of some of these contradictions. 

So he starts his treatise on this in The Decent of Man, by knowing that you have all the differences between man and the lower animals. The moral sense is by far the most important. I mean, Darwin was quick to submit that we are the only species who are doing, the kinds of things we're all doing right now. Right? Sitting in a school of law, that's trying to figure out, what the different moral concerns of society should be. Right? Hanging out in a classroom where we're talking about ethics and moral considerations. We are alone in the animal kingdom in doing these kinds of things. 

__But as Darwin would go on to say, it seems like if you look carefully, you might expect, you know, any old animal that had these well-marked social instincts, if you're a social creature, you might inevitably acquire something like a moral sense, or a conscience.__

And here's the rub. We seem to think, of course, we're very different from other animals. But based on the fact that natural selection works in the same way in us as it does in other species, you might expect other species with social concerns to develop relatively similar moral senses.

It really raises this question of do other animals have moral concerns, are they a lot like our own and in particular for purposes of this class, what can we actually learn about the human moral sense from terming to the moral senses of other animals?

First, I'm going to ask the question of whether or not non human animals share some of the kinds of moral concerns that you might think, are pretty hallmarks of our, our own species, and I'm going to focus specifically on some of the moral concerns you guys talked about a few weeks ago. These are ones that people like Jonathan Haidt and others have submitted that there might be some universal aspects of the human moral sphere. 

And I'm going to focus on a couple different domains. Suffering and harm, domains of hierarchy and authority, and also this question of reciprocity and fairness. And what we're going to see is in all of these cases, we're going to see hallmarks of human-like moral concerns in non-human animals and also some important differences. And so that's going to be the bulk of the talk today but then I thought I would end with a sort of special section or a part two, where we really zoom in on the evolutionary tree and try to take a pick, a peek specifically at our closest living relatives and try to see what, what their moral lives actually say about our own moralities. And one of the things that we're going to see is that when we take that peek and sort of zoom in on our branch of closest related primates, __we see some hints that the kinds of immoral actions humans are capable of, seem to be different than the rest of the animal kingdom, but similar to some of the immoral acts of other closely related species.__

But, First, before jumping to that we're going to sort of start with these universal moral constraints. And I thought I'd start here with this idea of whether a non-human animals share concerns about issues related to the suffering and harm. And the reason for this is I think here's a spot where you might think that nature wouldn't build creatures that care about morality in the same way that we do, right? We have these lay notions of nature that in fact, nature's not at all concerned with suffering and harm. In fact, it kind of promotes it. Nature is sort of read in tooth and claw. __We expect to kind of look out at the animal kingdom and see, you know, individuals going for the jugular. But the fact of the matter is is that when you really look at the natural behavior of animals, you find strikingly little of this. If you actually look at how individuals interact within their own species with other con specifics, you find remarkably little aggression and violence.__ Or in cases where you do see it, it's rather checked. 

These are critters out there that have, have weapons that are built, seemingly specifically for the purpose of doing these kinds of aggressive acts. I've just picked, you know, out of a set of animals I could have chosen, these bull elk here, these guys, as you can see, have incredibly impressive weapons that natural selection devotes lots of effort to making sharp and scary and big. But if you look at how often bull elk actually, you know, literally rip each other to shreds with these weapons, what you find is that it's actually not very much. __Instead if you look at their natural behavior you see a number of different behaviors that are aimed at showing restraint when using these kinds of weapons.__ 

Normally bull elk wouldn't even ever face each other with their weapons so poised to actually hurt each other. First, they do very sensitive things like assess each others' size by walking in parallel with each other. Then, they actually assess each others'strength through the use of vocalizations. Only if that doesn't work, do they escalate to actually measuring sort of antlers versus antlers who's of the right size. And it's only in very rare cases that those sort of attempt don't work, that they actually get to fighting. But even then you don't see them using these impressive weapons in the way that you might expect, through lethal levels of aggression. When natural selection builds in weapons, it often also builds in restraint in which to deal with them. 

This raises the question about, you know, is this just a funny feature of animal weaponry, or is it the case that animals really are trying to prevent unnecessary harm, perhaps even trying to help each other. And that's where we're going to go with this sort of question about suffering and harm. We're going to explore whether non-human animals actually care about the suffering of others. Do they feel pain when others feel pain? Do they actually feel a motivation to help others? 

Frans De Waal I think does a really good job of articulating these anecdotal cases in which you see animals doing things to each other that suggests they don't like it when a con-specific is feeling pain. So this is a case of, in chimpanzees, when you see individuals like this little guy here actually reaching out and trying to caress individuals who were involved in a fight. You see all kinds of post conflict behavior like this suggesting, at least anecdotally, animals don't like to see others in pain and will act to sort of remedy that. But is there any experimental evidence of something like this? Can you actually see this if you put animals into an experimental situation that will do things to help others. 

Well there's not much recent work on this topic, but there actually was a lot of early work on this back in the 1960's, I think when the ethics of doing studies with animals were a little bit different. But Rice and Gainer did a first study on this, actually looking at whether rats would be willing to help other rats. And the way they did this was to first train a novel rat on this sort of, weird contraption. The rat learns that every time he presses this he's actually able to lower this sort of rig up there, this sort of rope with a block hanging onto it. And the rat learned that actually at different times the lever would be differentially hard to do. So sometimes it was hard to do it. Sometimes it was easy. All this was, this was the prelude to the experiment in question, which was to ask if the rat would be more motivated to push the lever if it wasn't a block. But a very helpless little rat, sort of, you know, squeak, squeak, help, you know. But this is a question, this, you know, rat may or may not know this other rat in question. __Is it motivated to work extra hard to actually help this other rat out? And what Rice and Gainer found was that, in fact, rats would do this.__ They worked much harder than when it was not a, another rat that was sort of harnessed up by this rig. And they actually seemed to need an actual other rat who was there squealing in pain. If you give them a situation which they can press a lever just to shut off an auditory version of a bunch of rat screams. Just the auditory information they were getting. What you find is that rat's won't normal do that. But seeing an actual other rat in distress caused them to take action. Question is what is the rat representing? How are they doing this? You don't know the answer to these kinds of questions. But you do see the same kinds of helping behavior to relieve stress in a bunch of other species. 

Masserman and colleagues did this with a famous set of experiments with rhesus monkeys, something very similar. They actually allowed rhesus monkeys to earn the food that they would get during the day by pulling a lever like this one. So a rhesus monkey learns every time he pulls this chain he gets food. But then again on the fateful day of the study the monkey comes in and realizes hey there's a conspecific there. I wonder what happens when I pull the lever. Turns out when he pulled the lever he also got food just as before, but this time every time he pulled the lever he would also shock the other monkey with a series of pretty awful electric shocks. The question is, what does this poor monkey do? He's getting his food from the act of pulling this lever. That's how he get's his food. Will he refrain, knowing that it's actually hurting a con-specific? And the answer trialed out to be, yes. __What you find is that most of the monkeys that Masserman tested actually would refrain from pulling the chain that shocked another individual. And in some cases these researchers found that monkeys would forgo getting food for up to about 12 days, which is the point where they stopped the study.__ And the problem with this work is that because it was done back in the day, I think we have little understanding of what was really going on in these monkey's minds. You know, what were they trying to achieve? Did they just not like the stimulus? Did they really empathetically feel for this other money who was being shocked? . But I think that it is important to point out how impressive this behavior is when you compare it with the kind of thing that humans would do in similar studies because as many of you who have taken Intro Pysch know, this exactly the kind of experiment that Milgrim and is colleagues did with human participants. And if there is a scary authority figure there, human participants are happy to shock another con-specific, sometimes to the point of giving pretend fatal shocks. So, especially impressive when you look at what other humans are doing. 

Now how about the question whether other animals are motivated to help other individuals. The work of Felix Warneken that I think you've seen before has shown that very young human children are willing to do this. It turns out non human animals, particularly chimpanzees, are also willing to do this. Warneken also did a study where a human was trying to do something, namely scrub this block for some reason, and lost her sponge. And what you see is that chimpanzees are actually quite willing to help the human there. This is helping humans, how about helping other chimpanzees? Well, Warneken also did a set of studies where chimps could help other chimps. This is the chimp who's in need. He's actually trying to get into this side of the room because there's some food that he wants but the door is locked. __And what Warneken found was that this other chimpanzee on this side will actually work to open the lock so that the second chimpanzee can get in and get the food.__ Incidentally, the chimpanzee who's helping isn't getting any food here, he seems to be just doing this out of a motivation to help others. So we seem like this helping behavior seems to be shared as well. How about cases of real sorts of helping, not just helping somebody achieve a goal but really giving other individuals sustenance as we do in the case of donating food. Well, this has been a long line of studies in primates with a little bit of mixed results, but there's some species that seem to show evidence of actually wanting to share and donate food to other individuals. 

#### Capuchins
- Capuchins are pro-social to groupmates and their kin.
- They chose by chance whether to be pro-social or not when it was a different individual.
- When the other individual is anonymous, capuchins are strategically jerks.
.

#### Hierarchy
- Most animals, like us, operate in some type of hierarchy.
- Do they moralize them in the same way cultures moralize human hierarchies and status?
- Animals do care about status.
- Do they pay to get information about other individuals of higher status?
  + Monkey has option to get more juice or to see photo of another monkey.
  + Yes, they do take less juice to see the pictures. Sometimes, a lot for the high status faces.
  + And actually, they pay the most for monkey porno.
- Hot spring monkeys: They are like an exclusive club, only high ranking individuals get to go in.
  + Why don't low ranking animals go in?
  + Chimps imitate high-ranking individuals more.

#### Fairness and Reciprocity
- Vampire bats care a bit about cheating. They check if the other bats have big tummies.
- Black hamlet fish: Since they are hermaphrodites they have to decide who is male or female. Not for social reasons but the female exerts more effort. Tit-for-tat is going on here. When an individual defects, they swim away.
- Capuchins were willing to share more food with a monkey who also helped.
- They also hated getting a lower quality reward than the other individual.

There are also examples of __advantageous inequity aversion__, or when there is inequity but you are benefiting. __You don't see this in animals.__

Are animals willing to punish violations of equity? In the ultimatum game, proposers were unfair, and receivers never reject the unfair offers. They rejected the zero offers, but they took any amount of food that was there, suggesting they're not willing to inhibit this urge to take this bad payoff. They can't sort of stand up and punish the other individuals for their unfairness. 

In fact if you look across human populations, the chimpanzee performance looks only like one other population of humans, and that's populations of humans who have lesions in their brain. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator simulates this in humans.

#### Cruelty in chimps
- We are closest to chimps an bonobos.
- Chimps engage in a lot of intragroup violence and beating up females. And infanticide.
- Inter-community interactions are pretty scary.
- There is a lot of lethal aggression. They gang up and beat up lone individual.
- Lots of similarities between chimps and human warfare. This usually happens not within the group but between groups of individuals.
- Spoils of war: Victors get more land, more resources, and more females.

#### Bonobos
- No inter-group violence, no lethal raiding. Males aren't as mean to females and infanticide. Very chill.
- Lots of love-making. Male-female male-male female-female.
- Bonobo females have peaceful relations with males via female solidarity. They have alliances and they can dominate males.
- Males can't form coalitions because females have their own coalitions themselves.
- Why do Bonobos have these but chimps don't? Bonobos live in an environment where there are herbs continuously on the ground. Chimps have gorilla competition so to get their share, females forage alone. (Demonic male hypothesis.)

#### Ending
The scary thing that I think we learned is that whatever those pressures were for chimpanzees, they seemed to most likely be the same pressures that led to our own psychological mechanisms and our own cases of inter-group violence.

Again, we don't have great insight into what exactly those mechanisms are, but we know that they're the ones that are shared with chimpanzees and perhaps no other creature out there on the planet. And sort of that's where we are, and I want to end with sort of some of the implications of some of this stuff, because I think there's another worrying part of this evolutionary story that we need to deal with, which is that chimpanzees have all the psychological mechanisms, and, and devices that they have, their own strength and size, but we go beyond all of those things. 

What is scary is that we have moved from humans with sticks to humans with nukes in the blink of an evolutionary eye.

## 3 - 6 - 3.6 - Development of Morality - 18_15

The question of what it's like to be a baby. What it's like to be a toddler is for me irresistable. I was once one of those but I can't remember and, and I've been trying to figure out what their mental lives are like is to me an exhilarating project. But I'm also interested in development because it's a way to explore fundamental questions of human nature. And this is I think particularly the case when it comes to morality. 

So, early on we talked about moral universals and moral diversity. And we said, you know, it could be cultural. It could be learned. They could be inventions that, that people pass on from one to another. But another possibility is that it could be evolved. It could be a part of natural selection. Almost certainly, the answer's going to be both. Some will, would be cultural, some would be evolutionary. But which is which, and how could we tell? 

We spent a couple lectures looking at evolutionary theory and how evolutionary theory provides us with a way of thinking about how these things could come to be. But that doesn't really mean that, that this is what actually happened. Well, one way to find out is developmentally. One way to find out is by looking at how morality emerges in babies and young children. __Because, for the most part, if something is the product of culture, it'll emerge late.__ It'll emerge as a child becomes, goes to school, and church, and learns from his parents and gradually becomes part of society. 

Well, if it evolved, it's at least possible that it'll show very early. That the neurological development that gives rise to what will pop out early. So at least possible to find some morality in babies and young children. An idea that this could be the case is something which has intrigued people for a long time. A lot of philosophers are inhabitant purists. They believe that there is, the mind is a blank slate. That morality comes from outside, but there always been some deep thinkers who have been sympathetic to the idea that we are born with some sort of moral capacity.

One of my favorite examples here is Thomas Jefferson. So, you know, writing at the time of Adam Smith and other great moral philosophers, moral psychologists, Jefferson speculated in a letter to a friend that, the moral sense, or conscience, is as much a part of man as his leg or arm. It is given to all human beings in a stronger or weaker degree as force of members is given them in a lesser, a greater or lesser degree. And we've already seen some of that. We've already seen some of that when we talked about empathy and compassion. What we've seen is a bit of evidence that for babies and for children, the pain of others is painful for them. They see somebody crying they're likely to cry themselves. They're likely to be moved themselves. we, we also see very early on this, this motive to pat, to comfort, to soothe the pain of others. We see early on some degree of Altruism, off kindness, of helping, of handing over a toy or handing over some food. Not to everybody but to those close to you. And this suggests to, to some extent some of our moral sentiments and moral motivations are present very early on, and that to some extent Jefferson is right. 

But, and here's an actually an example of this sort of altruism. This is from an experiment by Felix Varnaken and Michael Tomasello. And and it, it involves a child being put in a situation where someone is in some sort of mild stress and Varnaken and Tomasello were interested Would children spontaneously help, and you can see what they do here. Now, a different facet of morality is what Francis Hutchinson, who was Adam Smith's advisor called a moral sense. So, so far when talking with babies and kids, we're talking about sensitivities, and proclivities, feeling empathy, altruism. Hutchison meant something different by the moral sense. He meant it as a way to call a perceptual capacity. The capacity not to be motivated to do good and avoid doing bad, but rather to tell the difference. To to identify goodness and badness in the world. It turns out that the origin of the moral sense, the origin, the capacity to judge good and evil is a topic that my colleagues and I are very interested in.

And then babies would be shown videos where the character approaches either that which helped it, or that which hindered it. And as babies saw these videos, their looking time was measured as to how long they look at the different scenes. Logic being that babies will typically look longer at something that surprising or unusual and shorter at something which is expected. And we found in the study is for both nine month olds and 12 month olds, they look longer when a character approaches that which hindered it, versus that which helped it. Suggested they expect characters to to approach that, those who help and not those who hinder. That the, the movies you saw, that characters had faces. If you do the same study and don't have faces, the results are much messier Nine month olds don't show an effect at all. And at twelve month olds looking flips in a strange way. __And I think this is what, what goes on here. It's, the faces mark this off as social interaction not just a movement of things but as a social interaction. And when babies see this as social interaction, it triggers their social understanding.__ And they think of it in terms of helping and hindering, and approaching and avoiding, and so on. And this is some, somewhat relevant maybe to moral psychology. 

What do babies themselves think of these characters? Can babies morally evaluate them? That is, you have a situation where one character seems for an adult at least be good guy, a helping guy, and the other one where the where the character seems to be a bad guy, a hindering guy. Would it be easy for the babies? Now to ask that you have to move to a different sort of display in which there are sort of three dimensional movements. So were three dimensional characters. So now we're not testing looking time, we're testing reaching. And the logic is, you show babies the good guy and the bad guy, and you see who they prefer to reach for. And this is an example of one of the studies. 

And as you can see, for both the, the ten month olds and the six month olds, babies reach for the good guy more often than they reach for the bad guy. And this is not a subtle effect, this is a big effect. Now some of you are wondering, you think this could be for a couple of reasons. It could be that they like the good guy and their reaching for the good guy, or it could be they don't like the bad guy so their avoiding the bad guy and choosing the one that's not the bad guy, or it could be both. And to explore this you could imag, you could compare how do they respond to a good guy versus a neutral guy who doesn't do anything. They prefer the good guy. And a bad guy versus a neutral guy who doesn't do anything. Now they prefer the neutral guy. 

Suggesting that, that even the youngest kids, there's two forces at work. Babies are in favor of the good guy, and they are, find it aversive to deal with the bad guy. Now, we did a whole series of studies looking at going up the hill, going down the hill. and, you know, there were a lot of criticisms, legitimate ones, saying maybe there's something funny about the hill. Maybe there's something odd about the stimuli, this experiment. Maybe it's not morality at all but direction or gravity, or something else that babies are responding to. And for the most part these are perfectly legitimate arguments. 

I would predict that you like our babies, would assume that the puppet who gave the ball back is the good guy And the puppet who ran away from the ball is the bad guy. And in, that is, in fact what babies at the same age we study with the hill climbing, what babies believe. Now does this count as morality? Is this the, the foundation for moral understanding? I'm just going to show you a little clip of a baby making a choice here. Simply because it's adorable. So does this count as morality? You know, we don't know for sure. Is this the foundation for later on, your judgement and my judgement, that person's a good person, that person's a bad person. It's unclear. It's very hard to disentangle morality from preference. And as you'll remember from very first lecture even philosophers have definition of morality to draw upon. But you'll also remember from the first lecture that morality is related to certain things. 

Among other things it's related to notions of reward and punishment. If we see something that's morally good, we'd like to reward it. And if we see something that's morally bad, we'd like to punish it. And it turns out babies want to do the same thing. 

And I'll end by telling you one very nice study by a Marco Schmidt and Jessica Summerville. And this also involved babies expectations about goodness and badness. But now they weren't interested in in, you know, helping and hindering or or stealing and giving back, they were interested in fairness. And so what they didn't studied was they showed babies one of two arrays. And in these arrays, characters would either split something evenly to two other people, two and two, or unevenly, one and three. And this is with 15-month olds, 15-month old babies. __And what they found was babies would look longer, indicating surprise when the split was one to three, rather than being two two.__ Now, you can skeptically say, well, maybe just they look longer at uneven distributions in general. But Schmidt and Sommerville were clever, and had another study where they had the same distributions but no people. And here there was no difference. Suggesting that they weren't responding to distributions per say. It's not that they looked longer at three one versus two two. But rather they look longer. They're surprised by unfair distributions more so than fair distributions. And we'll return to many of these issues when we talk about economic gains, and the developing notions of fairness both within western society and also even other societies. I think in general, the baby work, the findings, the early morality or early proto-morality, or hence the morality in babies is, is quite interesting and quite promising. But there are limits to this work. There are limits to what we know. There are open questions, and they're a problem that we don't quite know yet how to solve. And this is what I want to devote the next short and final lecture for this week about.

## 3 - 7 - 3.7 - How Much Can Evolution Explain

So, one is the ethics of divinity. This is a term by Schweder, anthropologist Schweder this is purity and other matters. I began with the issues of the morality of sex and death, food. About being pure and being impure. Certainly the morality of sex is a really fundamental part of our moral systems, and you don't find any hint of this, this moral code in babies. I don't think you find any hint of it in non-human primates. Moreover, the mechanisms we used to, to explain evolution of morality, kin selection, or reciprocal altruism Don't seem to do well at explaining, why would we care so much and how we bury the data, which foods we eat or or how we have sex. Now this is something which I think is really interesting and we'll, we'll return to that later, but I want to sort of say we haven't really explained much of it now. To an extent they're universals. They're mysterious universals. 

The second category of things we don't know about is actually a very specific evolutionary problem and this involves third party sentiments, third party judgements. What I mean by that is not judging that if you hit me you're bad, that's a first party, second party sort of thing, but rather if I see one person hitting another person something bad has gone on. Now, I hope I've shown in the baby studies, that babies are sensitive. Babies approve of the good guy who disapprove of the bad guy. Babies want to reward the good guy and punish the bad guy. So babies seem to be, we seem to be reasoning about the interactions of third parties from the get go. What's harder to explain, or at least what we haven't explained yet, is how could morality evolve? How do we care? Why would I want to punish somebody who's done something bad to somebody else? Where's the evolutionary advantage in that? Where's the evolutionary benefit? And I believe that is an open question to be pursued later. 

The third open question is extending morality to strangers. So, we, we've, the kin selection, reciprocal altruism, are wonderful evolutionary theories explaining why we care about our kin and why we care about those we are in continued reciprocal interaction with. But as we talked about last week, morality at least for us, at least for you and me, extends broader than that. We care about people we've never met. We care about people we haven't seen before. We care about people who who can do nothing for us. Who, for whom, our help to them could never be reciprocated. Yet, still morality extends more broadly. And that is a mystery. It is a mystery from evolutionary point of view. It's also, to some extent, a mystery from a developmental point of view. So, we talked about the kind responses and kind actions of babies and toddlers. But, their kind responses and kind actions goes in the immediate vicinity. We've talked about experimental research on altruism towards others but in all of these situations these are altruisms to those who are immediately present. And actually in these studies altruisms to those that the baby or tottaler had some prior interaction with. We are not strangers. And how we become nice to strangers what happens? Is something which is going to occupy us, later on in this course. 

And the fourth and final issue is we haven't discussed moral systems at all. So maybe for a baby, maybe to some extent for a chimpanzee. What morality is, is a set of, a capacity for judgments and instincts and responses But for us, it's more than that. We have systems of laws. We have notions of justice. We have notions of procedures. We have, we create elaborate moral systems. And underlying our creation of these moral systems is a notion that you could have a morality that is objective and impartial. We, we, every society creates laws that are meant to apply to varying degrees to everybody. Every moral system that gets to be called a moral system, has some sort of notion, some sort of appreciation of that, what, what should apply to me. Should apply to you if you were in my shoes. It called the golden rule in religion. Call it the, the, the contium principle that moral should be universal. Or the principle of the utilitarians that we have to add up pleasure and add up paid and it doesn't matter who it comes from. In these religious systems of morality, or these philosophical, these secular systems of morality. They seem to be A. Critically Important, but B. Way above of what we see from an evolutionary perspective and from a developmentally comparative perspective. They seem to be uniquely human They seem to be very very important. And they seem to be very difficult to explain. Though we will try. And I'll see you next week.

## Morals Without God?
[Link](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/morals-without-god/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0)

Can we envision a world without God? Would this world be good? Don’t think for one moment that the current battle lines between biology and fundamentalist Christianity turn around evidence. One has to be pretty immune to data to doubt evolution, which is why books and documentaries aimed at convincing the skeptics are a waste of effort. They are helpful for those prepared to listen, but fail to reach their target audience. The debate is less about the truth than about how to handle it. For those who believe that morality comes straight from God the creator, acceptance of evolution would open a moral abyss.

#### Our Vaunted Frontal Lobe

Echoing this view, Reverend Al Sharpton opined in a recent videotaped debate: “If there is no order to the universe, and therefore some being, some force that ordered it, then who determines what is right or wrong? There is nothing immoral if there’s nothing in charge.”

Perhaps it is just me, but I am wary of anyone whose belief system is the only thing standing between them and repulsive behavior. __Why not assume that our humanity, including the self-control needed for livable societies, is built into us? Does anyone truly believe that our ancestors lacked social norms before they had religion?__

Deep down, creationists realize they will never win factual arguments with science. This is why they have construed their own science-like universe, known as Intelligent Design, and eagerly jump on every tidbit of information that seems to go their way.

Whether creationists jump on this scientific scandal or linguists and psychologists keep selling human exceptionalism does not really matter. Fraud has occurred in many fields of science, from epidemiology to physics, all of which are still around.

If we consider our species without letting ourselves be blinded by the technical advances of the last few millennia, we see a creature of flesh and blood with a brain that, albeit three times larger than a chimpanzee’s, doesn’t contain any new parts. 

Even our vaunted prefrontal cortex turns out to be of typical size: recent neuron-counting techniques classify the human brain as a linearly scaled-up monkey brain. No one doubts the superiority of our intellect, but we have no basic wants or needs that are not also present in our close relatives. I interact on a daily basis with monkeys and apes, which just like us strive for power, enjoy sex, want security and affection, kill over territory, and value trust and cooperation. Yes, we use cell phones and fly airplanes, but our psychological make-up remains that of a social primate.

#### The Pleasure of Giving

Charles Darwin was interested in how morality fits the human-animal continuum, proposing in “The Descent of Man”: “Any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts … would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well developed … as in man.”

Unfortunately, modern popularizers have strayed from these insights. Like Robert Wright in “The Moral Animal,” they argue that true moral tendencies cannot exist — not in humans and even less in other animals — since nature is one hundred percent selfish. Morality is just a thin veneer over a cauldron of nasty tendencies. Dubbing this position “Veneer Theory” (similar to Peter Railton’s “moral camouflage”), I have fought it ever since my 1996 book “Good Natured.” __Instead of blaming atrocious behavior on our biology (“we’re acting like animals!”), while claiming our noble traits for ourselves, why not view the entire package as a product of evolution?__ Fortunately, there has been a resurgence of the Darwinian view that morality grew out of the social instincts. Psychologists stress the intuitive way we arrive at moral judgments while activating emotional brain areas, and economists and anthropologists have shown humanity to be far more cooperative, altruistic, and fair than predicted by self-interest models. Similarly, the latest experiments in primatology reveal that our close relatives will do each other favors even if there’s nothing in it for themselves.

Maintaining a peaceful society is one of the tendencies underlying human morality that we share with other primates, such as chimpanzees. After a fight between two adult males, one offers an open hand to his adversary. When the other accepts the invitation, both kiss and embrace.

Chimpanzees and bonobos will voluntarily open a door to offer a companion access to food, even if they lose part of it in the process. And capuchin monkeys are prepared to seek rewards for others, such as when we place two of them side by side, while one of them barters with us with differently colored tokens. One token is “selfish,” and the other “prosocial.” If the bartering monkey selects the selfish token, it receives a small piece of apple for returning it, but its partner gets nothing. The prosocial token, on the other hand, rewards both monkeys. Most monkeys develop an overwhelming preference for the prosocial token, which preference is not due to fear of repercussions, because dominant monkeys (who have least to fear) are the most generous.

Even though altruistic behavior evolved for the advantages it confers, this does not make it selfishly motivated. Future benefits rarely figure in the minds of animals. For example, animals engage in sex without knowing its reproductive consequences, and even humans had to develop the morning-after pill. This is because sexual motivation is unconcerned with the reason why sex exists. The same is true for the altruistic impulse, which is unconcerned with evolutionary consequences. It is this disconnect between evolution and motivation that befuddled the Veneer Theorists, and made them reduce everything to selfishness. The most quoted line of their bleak literature says it all: “Scratch an ‘altruist,’ and watch a ‘hypocrite’ bleed.”[3]

It is not only humans who are capable of genuine altruism; other animals are, too. I see it every day. An old female, Peony, spends her days outdoors with other chimpanzees at the Yerkes Primate Center’s Field Station. On bad days, when her arthritis is flaring up, she has trouble walking and climbing, but other females help her out. For example, Peony is huffing and puffing to get up into the climbing frame in which several apes have gathered for a grooming session. An unrelated younger female moves behind her, placing both hands on her ample behind and pushes her up with quite a bit of effort, until Peony has joined the rest.

We have also seen Peony getting up and slowly move towards the water spigot, which is at quite a distance. Younger females sometimes run ahead of her, take in some water, then return to Peony and give it to her. At first, we had no idea what was going on, since all we saw was one female placing her mouth close to Peony’s, but after a while the pattern became clear: Peony would open her mouth wide, and the younger female would spit a jet of water into it.

Such observations fit the emerging field of animal empathy, which deals not only with primates, but also with canines, elephants, even rodents. A typical example is how chimpanzees console distressed parties, hugging and kissing them, which behavior is so predictable that scientists have analyzed thousands of cases. Mammals are sensitive to each other’s emotions, and react to others in need. The whole reason people fill their homes with furry carnivores and not with, say, iguanas and turtles, is because mammals offer something no reptile ever will. They give affection, they want affection, and respond to our emotions the way we do to theirs.

__Mammals may derive pleasure from helping others in the same way that humans feel good doing good.__ Nature often equips life’s essentials — sex, eating, nursing — with built-in gratification. One study found that pleasure centers in the human brain light up when we give to charity. This is of course no reason to call such behavior “selfish” as it would make the word totally meaningless. A selfish individual has no trouble walking away from another in need. Someone is drowning: let him drown. Someone cries: let her cry. These are truly selfish reactions, which are quite different from empathic ones. Yes, we experience a “warm glow,” and perhaps some other animals do as well, but since this glow reaches us via the other, and only via the other, the helping is genuinely other-oriented.

#### Bottom-Up Morality

A few years ago Sarah Brosnan and I demonstrated that primates will happily perform a task for cucumber slices until they see others getting grapes, which taste so much better. The cucumber-eaters become agitated, throw down their measly veggies and go on strike. A perfectly fine food has become unpalatable as a result of seeing a companion with something better.

We called it inequity aversion, a topic since investigated in other animals, including dogs. A dog will repeatedly perform a trick without rewards, but refuse as soon as another dog gets pieces of sausage for the same trick. Recently, Sarah reported an unexpected twist to the inequity issue, however. While testing pairs of chimps, she found that also the one who gets the better deal occasionally refuses. It is as if they are satisfied only if both get the same. We seem to be getting close to a sense of fairness.

Such findings have implications for human morality. According to most philosophers, we reason ourselves towards a moral position. Even if we do not invoke God, it is still a top-down process of us formulating the principles and then imposing those on human conduct. But would it be realistic to ask people to be considerate of others if we had not already a natural inclination to be so? Would it make sense to appeal to fairness and justice in the absence of powerful reactions to their absence? Imagine the cognitive burden if every decision we took needed to be vetted against handed-down principles. Instead, I am a firm believer in the Humean position that reason is the slave of the passions. We started out with moral sentiments and intuitions, which is also where we find the greatest continuity with other primates. Rather than having developed morality from scratch, we received a huge helping hand from our background as social animals.

At the same time, however, I am reluctant to call a chimpanzee a “moral being.” This is because sentiments do not suffice. We strive for a logically coherent system, and have debates about how the death penalty fits arguments for the sanctity of life, or whether an unchosen sexual orientation can be wrong. These debates are uniquely human. We have no evidence that other animals judge the appropriateness of actions that do not affect themselves. The great pioneer of morality research, the Finn Edward Westermarck, explained what makes the moral emotions special: “Moral emotions are disconnected from one’s immediate situation: they deal with good and bad at a more abstract, disinterested level.” This is what sets human morality apart: a move towards universal standards combined with an elaborate system of justification, monitoring and punishment.

At this point, religion comes in. Think of the narrative support for compassion, such as the Parable of the Good Samaritan, or the challenge to fairness, such as the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard, with its famous conclusion “The last will be first, and the first will be last.” Add to this an almost Skinnerian fondness of reward and punishment — from the virgins to be met in heaven to the hell fire that awaits sinners — and the exploitation of our desire to be “praiseworthy,” as Adam Smith called it. Humans are so sensitive to public opinion that we only need to see a picture of two eyes glued to the wall to respond with good behavior, which explains the image in some religions of an all-seeing eye to symbolize an omniscient God.

#### The Atheist Dilemma

While I do consider religious institutions fair game for criticism, what good could come from insulting individuals who find value in religion? And more pertinently, what alternative does science have to offer? __Science is not in the business of spelling out the meaning of life and even less in telling us how to live our lives. We, scientists, are good at finding out why things are the way they are, or how things work, and I do believe that biology can help us understand what kind of animals we are and why our morality looks the way it does.__ But to go from there to offering moral guidance seems a stretch.

Even the staunchest atheist growing up in Western society cannot avoid having absorbed the basic tenets of Christian morality. Our societies are steeped in it: everything we have accomplished over the centuries, even science, developed either hand in hand with or in opposition to religion, but never separately. __It is impossible to know what morality would look like without religion. It would require a visit to a human culture that is not now and never was religious. That such cultures do not exist should give us pause.__

Other primates have of course none of these problems, but even they strive for a certain kind of society. For example, female chimpanzees have been seen to drag reluctant males towards each other to make up after a fight, removing weapons from their hands, and high-ranking males regularly act as impartial arbiters to settle disputes in the community. I take these hints of community concern as yet another sign that the building blocks of morality are older than humanity, and that we do not need God to explain how we got where we are today. On the other hand, what would happen if we were able to excise religion from society? I doubt that science and the naturalistic worldview could fill the void and become an inspiration for the good. __Any framework we develop to advocate a certain moral outlook is bound to produce its own list of principles, its own prophets, and attract its own devoted followers, so that it will soon look like any old religion.__

## The Moral Life of Babies 
[Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/magazine/09babies-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0%20)

Not long ago, a team of researchers watched a 1-year-old boy take justice into his own hands. The boy had just seen a puppet show in which one puppet played with a ball while interacting with two other puppets. The center puppet would slide the ball to the puppet on the right, who would pass it back. And the center puppet would slide the ball to the puppet on the left . . . who would run away with it. Then the two puppets on the ends were brought down from the stage and set before the toddler. Each was placed next to a pile of treats. At this point, the toddler was asked to take a treat away from one puppet. Like most children in this situation, the boy took it from the pile of the “naughty” one. But this punishment wasn’t enough — he then leaned over and smacked the puppet in the head.

A growing body of evidence suggests that humans do have a rudimentary moral sense from the very start of life. With the help of well-designed experiments, you can see glimmers of moral thought, moral judgment and moral feeling even in the first year of life. Some sense of good and evil seems to be bred in the bone. Which is not to say that parents are wrong to concern themselves with moral development or that their interactions with their children are a waste of time. Socialization is critically important. But this is not because babies and young children lack a sense of right and wrong; it’s because the sense of right and wrong that they naturally possess diverges in important ways from what we adults would want it to be.

A reason this view has persisted is that, for many years, scientists weren’t sure how to go about studying the mental life of babies. In the 1980s, however, psychologists interested in exploring how much babies know began making use of one of the few behaviors that young babies can control: the movement of their eyes. The eyes are a window to the baby’s soul. As adults do, when babies see something that they find interesting or surprising, they tend to look at it longer than they would at something they find uninteresting or expected. And when given a choice between two things to look at, babies usually opt to look at the more pleasing thing. You can use “looking time,” then, as a rough but reliable proxy for what captures babies’ attention: what babies are surprised by or what babies like.

The studies in the 1980s that made use of this methodology were able to discover surprising things about what babies know about the nature and workings of physical objects — a baby’s “naïve physics.” Psychologists — most notably Elizabeth Spelke and Renée Baillargeon — conducted studies that essentially involved showing babies magic tricks, events that seemed to violate some law of the universe: you remove the supports from beneath a block and it floats in midair, unsupported; an object disappears and then reappears in another location; a box is placed behind a screen, the screen falls backward into empty space. Like adults, babies tend to linger on such scenes — they look longer at them than at scenes that are identical in all regards except that they don’t violate physical laws. This suggests that babies have expectations about how objects should behave. A vast body of research now suggests that — contrary to what was taught for decades to legions of psychology undergraduates — babies think of objects largely as adults do, as connected masses that move as units, that are solid and subject to gravity and that move in continuous paths through space and time.

Other studies, starting with a 1992 paper by my wife, Karen, have found that babies can do rudimentary math with objects. The demonstration is simple. Show a baby an empty stage. Raise a screen to obscure part of the stage. In view of the baby, put a Mickey Mouse doll behind the screen. Then put another Mickey Mouse doll behind the screen. Now drop the screen. Adults expect two dolls — and so do 5-month-olds: if the screen drops to reveal one or three dolls, the babies look longer, in surprise, than they do if the screen drops to reveal two.

A second wave of studies used looking-time methods to explore what babies know about the minds of others — a baby’s “naïve psychology.” __Psychologists had known for a while that even the youngest of babies treat people different from inanimate objects. Babies like to look at faces; they mimic them, they smile at them. They expect engagement: if a moving object becomes still, they merely lose interest; if a person’s face becomes still, however, they become distressed.__

But the new studies found that babies have an actual understanding of mental life: they have some grasp of how people think and why they act as they do. The studies showed that, though babies expect inanimate objects to move as the result of push-pull interactions, they expect people to move rationally in accordance with their beliefs and desires: babies show surprise when someone takes a roundabout path to something he wants. They expect someone who reaches for an object to reach for the same object later, even if its location has changed. And well before their 2nd birthdays, babies are sharp enough to know that other people can have false beliefs. The psychologists Kristine Onishi and Renée Baillargeon have found that 15-month-olds expect that if a person sees an object in one box, and then the object is moved to another box when the person isn’t looking, the person will later reach into the box where he first saw the object, not the box where it actually is. That is, toddlers have a mental model not merely of the world but of the world as understood by someone else.

These discoveries inevitably raise a question: If babies have such a rich understanding of objects and people so early in life, why do they seem so ignorant and helpless? Why don’t they put their knowledge to more active use? One possible answer is that these capacities are the psychological equivalent of physical traits like testicles or ovaries, which are formed in infancy and then sit around, useless, for years and years. Another possibility is that babies do, in fact, use their knowledge from Day 1, not for action but for learning. One lesson from the study of artificial intelligence (and from cognitive science more generally) is that an empty head learns nothing: a system that is capable of rapidly absorbing information needs to have some prewired understanding of what to pay attention to and what generalizations to make. Babies might start off smart, then, because it enables them to get smarter.

#### Nice Babies

Psychologists like myself who are interested in the cognitive capacities of babies and toddlers are now turning our attention to whether babies have a “naïve morality.” But there is reason to proceed with caution. Morality, after all, is a different sort of affair than physics or psychology. The truths of physics and psychology are universal: objects obey the same physical laws everywhere; and people everywhere have minds, goals, desires and beliefs. But the existence of a universal moral code is a highly controversial claim; there is considerable evidence for wide variation from society to society.

__In the journal Science a couple of months ago, the psychologist Joseph Henrich and several of his colleagues reported a cross-cultural study of 15 diverse populations and found that people’s propensities to behave kindly to strangers and to punish unfairness are strongest in large-scale communities with market economies, where such norms are essential to the smooth functioning of trade.__ Henrich and his colleagues concluded that much of the morality that humans possess is a consequence of the culture in which they are raised, not their innate capacities.

At the same time, though, people everywhere have some sense of right and wrong. You won’t find a society where people don’t have some notion of fairness, don’t put some value on loyalty and kindness, don’t distinguish between acts of cruelty and innocent mistakes, don’t categorize people as nasty or nice. These universals make evolutionary sense. Since natural selection works, at least in part, at a genetic level, there is a logic to being instinctively kind to our kin, whose survival and well-being promote the spread of our genes. More than that, it is often beneficial for humans to work together with other humans, which means that it would have been adaptive to evaluate the niceness and nastiness of other individuals. All this is reason to consider the innateness of at least basic moral concepts.

In addition, scientists know that certain compassionate feelings and impulses emerge early and apparently universally in human development. These are not moral concepts, exactly, but they seem closely related. One example is feeling pain at the pain of others. In his book “The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,” Charles Darwin, a keen observer of human nature, tells the story of how his first son, William, was fooled by his nurse into expressing sympathy at a very young age: “When a few days over 6 months old, his nurse pretended to cry, and I saw that his face instantly assumed a melancholy expression, with the corners of his mouth strongly depressed.”

__There seems to be something evolutionarily ancient to this empathetic response. If you want to cause a rat distress, you can expose it to the screams of other rats. Human babies, notably, cry more to the cries of other babies than to tape recordings of their own crying, suggesting that they are responding to their awareness of someone else’s pain, not merely to a certain pitch of sound.__ Babies also seem to want to assuage the pain of others: once they have enough physical competence (starting at about 1 year old), they soothe others in distress by stroking and touching or by handing over a bottle or toy. There are individual differences, to be sure, in the intensity of response: some babies are great soothers; others don’t care as much. But the basic impulse seems common to all. (Some other primates behave similarly: the primatologist Frans de Waal reports that chimpanzees “will approach a victim of attack, put an arm around her and gently pat her back or groom her.” Monkeys, on the other hand, tend to shun victims of aggression.)

Some recent studies have explored the existence of behavior in toddlers that is “altruistic” in an even stronger sense — like when they give up their time and energy to help a stranger accomplish a difficult task. The psychologists Felix Warneken and Michael Tomasello have put toddlers in situations in which an adult is struggling to get something done, like opening a cabinet door with his hands full or trying to get to an object out of reach. The toddlers tend to spontaneously help, even without any prompting, encouragement or reward.

Is any of the above behavior recognizable as moral conduct? Not obviously so. Moral ideas seem to involve much more than mere compassion. Morality, for instance, is closely related to notions of praise and blame: we want to reward what we see as good and punish what we see as bad. Morality is also closely connected to the ideal of impartiality — if it’s immoral for you to do something to me, then, all else being equal, it is immoral for me to do the same thing to you. In addition, moral principles are different from other types of rules or laws: they cannot, for instance, be overruled solely by virtue of authority. (Even a 4-year-old knows not only that unprovoked hitting is wrong but also that it would continue to be wrong even if a teacher said that it was O.K.) And we tend to associate morality with the possibility of free and rational choice; people choose to do good or evil. To hold someone responsible for an act means that we believe that he could have chosen to act otherwise.

Babies and toddlers might not know or exhibit any of these moral subtleties. Their sympathetic reactions and motivations — including their desire to alleviate the pain of others — may not be much different in kind from purely nonmoral reactions and motivations like growing hungry or wanting to void a full bladder. Even if that is true, though, it is hard to conceive of a moral system that didn’t have, as a starting point, these empathetic capacities. As David Hume argued, mere rationality can’t be the foundation of morality, since our most basic desires are neither rational nor irrational. “ ’Tis not contrary to reason,” he wrote, “to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger.” To have a genuinely moral system, in other words, some things first have to matter, and what we see in babies is the development of mattering.

#### Moral-Baby Experiments

In the end, we found that 6- and 10-month-old infants overwhelmingly preferred the helpful individual to the hindering individual. This wasn’t a subtle statistical trend; just about all the babies reached for the good guy. Babies are drawn to the nice guy and repelled by the mean guy. Again, these results were not subtle; babies almost always showed this pattern of response.

Does our research show that babies believe that the helpful character is good and the hindering character is bad? Not necessarily. All that we can safely infer from what the babies reached for is that babies prefer the good guy and show an aversion to the bad guy. But what’s exciting here is that these preferences are based on how one individual treated another, on whether one individual was helping another individual achieve its goals or hindering it. 

Which individual would you prefer — someone who rewarded good guys and punished bad guys or someone who punished good guys and rewarded bad guys? The same amount of rewarding and punishing is going on in both cases, but by adult lights, one individual is acting justly and the other isn’t. Can babies see this, too?

They had to choose between a puppet who rewarded a good guy versus a puppet who punished a good guy. Likewise, we showed them a character who acted as a hinderer (for example, keeping a puppet from opening a box) and then had them choose between a puppet who rewarded the bad guy versus one who punished the bad guy.

The results were striking. When the target of the action was itself a good guy, babies preferred the puppet who was nice to it. This alone wasn’t very surprising, given that the other studies found an overall preference among babies for those who act nicely. What was more interesting was what happened when they watched the bad guy being rewarded or punished. Here they chose the punisher. __Despite their overall preference for good actors over bad, then, babies are drawn to bad actors when those actors are punishing bad behavior.__

All of this research, taken together, supports a general picture of baby morality. It’s even possible, as a thought experiment, to ask what it would be like to see the world in the moral terms that a baby does. __Babies probably have no conscious access to moral notions, no idea why certain acts are good or bad. They respond on a gut level.__ Indeed, if you watch the older babies during the experiments, they don’t act like impassive judges — they tend to smile and clap during good events and frown, shake their heads and look sad during the naughty events (remember the toddler who smacked the bad puppet). The babies’ experiences might be cognitively empty but emotionally intense, replete with strong feelings and strong desires. But this shouldn’t strike you as an altogether alien experience: while we adults possess the additional critical capacity of being able to consciously reason about morality, we’re not otherwise that different from babies — our moral feelings are often instinctive. In fact, one discovery of contemporary research in social psychology and social neuroscience is the powerful emotional underpinning of what we once thought of as cool, untroubled, mature moral deliberation.

#### Is This the Morality We’re Looking For?

What do these findings about babies’ moral notions tell us about adult morality? Some scholars think that the very existence of an innate moral sense has profound implications. In 1869, Alfred Russel Wallace, who along with Darwin discovered natural selection, wrote that certain human capacities — including “the higher moral faculties” — are richer than what you could expect from a product of biological evolution. He concluded that some sort of godly force must intervene to create these capacities.

A few years ago, in his book “What’s So Great About Christianity,” the social and cultural critic Dinesh D’Souza revived this argument. __He conceded that evolution can explain our niceness in instances like kindness to kin, where the niceness has a clear genetic payoff, but he drew the line at “high altruism,” acts of entirely disinterested kindness.__ For D’Souza, “there is no Darwinian rationale” for why you would give up your seat for an old lady on a bus, an act of nice-guyness that does nothing for your genes. And what about those who donate blood to strangers or sacrifice their lives for a worthy cause? D’Souza reasoned that these stirrings of conscience are best explained not by evolution or psychology but by “the voice of God within our souls.”

The evolutionary psychologist has a quick response to this: __To say that a biological trait evolves for a purpose doesn’t mean that it always functions, in the here and now, for that purpose.__ Sexual arousal, for instance, presumably evolved because of its connection to making babies; but of course we can get aroused in all sorts of situations in which baby-making just isn’t an option — for instance, while looking at pornography. Similarly, our impulse to help others has likely evolved because of the reproductive benefit that it gives us in certain contexts — and it’s not a problem for this argument that some acts of niceness that people perform don’t provide this sort of benefit. (And for what it’s worth, giving up a bus seat for an old lady, although the motives might be psychologically pure, turns out to be a coldbloodedly smart move from a Darwinian standpoint, an easy way to show off yourself as an attractively good person.)

The general argument that critics like Wallace and D’Souza put forward, however, still needs to be taken seriously. The morality of contemporary humans really does outstrip what evolution could possibly have endowed us with; moral actions are often of a sort that have no plausible relation to our reproductive success and don’t appear to be accidental byproducts of evolved adaptations. Many of us care about strangers in faraway lands, sometimes to the extent that we give up resources that could be used for our friends and family; many of us care about the fates of nonhuman animals, so much so that we deprive ourselves of pleasures like rib-eye steak and veal scaloppine. We possess abstract moral notions of equality and freedom for all; we see racism and sexism as evil; we reject slavery and genocide; we try to love our enemies. Of course, our actions typically fall short, often far short, of our moral principles, but these principles do shape, in a substantial way, the world that we live in. It makes sense then to marvel at the extent of our moral insight and to reject the notion that it can be explained in the language of natural selection. 

__If this higher morality or higher altruism were found in babies, the case for divine creation would get just a bit stronger.__

__But it is not present in babies. In fact, our initial moral sense appears to be biased toward our own kind.__ There’s plenty of research showing that babies have within-group preferences: 3-month-olds prefer the faces of the race that is most familiar to them to those of other races; 11-month-olds prefer individuals who share their own taste in food and expect these individuals to be nicer than those with different tastes; 12-month-olds prefer to learn from someone who speaks their own language over someone who speaks a foreign language. And studies with young children have found that once they are segregated into different groups — even under the most arbitrary of schemes, like wearing different colored T-shirts — they eagerly favor their own groups in their attitudes and their actions.

The notion at the core of any mature morality is that of impartiality. If you are asked to justify your actions, and you say, “Because I wanted to,” this is just an expression of selfish desire. But explanations like “It was my turn” or “It’s my fair share” are potentially moral, because they imply that anyone else in the same situation could have done the same. This is the sort of argument that could be convincing to a neutral observer and is at the foundation of standards of justice and law. The philosopher Peter Singer has pointed out that this notion of impartiality can be found in religious and philosophical systems of morality, from the golden rule in Christianity to the teachings of Confucius to the political philosopher John Rawls’s landmark theory of justice. This is an insight that emerges within communities of intelligent, deliberating and negotiating beings, and it can override our parochial impulses.

__The aspect of morality that we truly marvel at — its generality and universality — is the product of culture, not of biology.__ There is no need to posit divine intervention. A fully developed morality is the product of cultural development, of the accumulation of rational insight and hard-earned innovations. The morality we start off with is primitive, not merely in the obvious sense that it’s incomplete, but in the deeper sense that when individuals and societies aspire toward an enlightened morality — one in which all beings capable of reason and suffering are on an equal footing, where all people are equal — they are fighting with what children have from the get-go. The biologist Richard Dawkins was right, then, when he said at the start of his book “The Selfish Gene,” “Be warned that if you wish, as I do, to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly toward a common good, you can expect little help from biological nature.” Or as a character in the Kingsley Amis novel “One Fat Englishman” puts it, “It was no wonder that people were so horrible when they started life as children.”

Morality, then, is a synthesis of the biological and the cultural, of the unlearned, the discovered and the invented. Babies possess certain moral foundations — the capacity and willingness to judge the actions of others, some sense of justice, gut responses to altruism and nastiness. Regardless of how smart we are, if we didn’t start with this basic apparatus, we would be nothing more than amoral agents, ruthlessly driven to pursue our self-interest. But our capacities as babies are sharply limited. It is the insights of rational individuals that make a truly universal and unselfish morality something that our species can aspire to.

## 4 - 1 - 4.1 - Moral Differences - 9_04

I'd like to welcome everybody back. We we began the lectures last week by talking about moral differences and we gave some examples of this. We started with a Herodotus, who reminded us of the differences in how societies treat the dead. And pointed out that what some people find absolutely natural, in fact, morally mandatory, other societies find disgusting, vile, wrong. We we looked at a list provided by anthropologist, Richard Shweder. We listed all the ways in which societies differ, and it's a pretty impressive list regarding the roles of men and women regarding domains such as sex and alcohol and eating meat and how to raise your children. 

But then we went on in the series of lectures that followed. To argue for underlying moral universals. And we made a case for moral universals to at least some extent, looking at cross cultural facts, ways in which societies are the same, ways in which they differ, looking at evolution, exploring how evolutionary theory can ground certain moral universals. And looking at child development. Looking at how, what we know about young children, development of young children. The capacities of young babies support the idea that some aspects of morality are universal, and are universal because they are part of our natures. We are born with them. 

#### Moral Differences
- __Differences are interesting.__ Our attention is drawn to weird societies where the morality is crazy. We're also fascinated by differences that we see in people around us. These differences, the fact that these people so close to us can disagree with us, so much about morality is both intriging and, I think, upsetting. 
- __A second reason to be interested in differences is that they can tell us a little bit about the nature of morality.__ Differences can tell us how this machine works. What parts it has? How the parts are connected to one another? Now, it could turn out that this strategy won't work. It could turn out, for instance, that to the extent people differ in their morality, it's just random, it's just schmutz, it's, it's all over the place. It could turn out that way but it doesn't turn out that way. What we're going to see in the lectures that follow is that there's an order and systematicity to moral differences. Some things go together, some things don't, and by the study of these differences we can learn a lot about structure. And, constitution of our moral psychology. 
- __It helps us to be clearer of about our own morality.__ If you don't know that other people are dif, different from you, there's a temptation to believe that the way you do things is the only way to do things, and looking at other societies, and other people, can be hugely transformative. Because you learn there's a different way to do things, there's a different way to think about sex or property, or raising children. Moreover, not only is there a different way to do things, but people apparently live their lives under these different moral hues. And they're not crazy. They're not even obviously dysfunctional. Somehow, it works for them. Now, knowing this, I think it expands your perspective. It can give you a bit of humility about your own moral view.  

__So Herodotus thinks that once you see the differences, and once you see how seriously everybody takes their own morality, you end up as a, a moral relativist. You think that there's no way in which one moral system is better than another.__ To me that goes way too far. I'm not, I'm not a moral relativist. I think we can make evaluative claims that, this moral system in certain ways is better than this moral system. I just think that in order to do so, what we need just as a starting point, is a more sophisticated and careful way of thinking about differences.

Before we go on to say what those guys do is just wrong, they have a screwed up morality, we want to be clear on what their morality is and give it the most extensive and sympathetic analysis that we can.

## 4 - 2 - 4.2 - Kinds of Societies - 17_19

#### Individualism vs Collectivism
Western conception of a person: bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment, and action organized into a distinctive whole and set contrastively against each other, against other such wholes and against its social and natural background. 

He says, this is, however incorrigible it may seem to us, a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world's cultures. And Geertz is saying, that view you have of this distinct individual, with its own goals and motivations, set apart from everybody else. If you share this view, that may well be because you've been raised in a culture like mine, which is brought up to be individualistic. 

More generally there's a, a, a contrast between societies of the individualistic sort and a collectivist sort. And a collectivist sort is, as the name tells you, there's more emphasis on the collective, on groups and relationships. So to unpack it a little bit, societies that are individualistic and the prototypical society for this would be United States of America, Western Europe, think in terms of individual goals and initiatives. People are thought of as independent, there's the identity you have of, of yourself, there's the importance of being creative, maybe an importance of being different, there's the value of autonomy, there's less need to conform to a society, and there's more emphasis on self reliance. So if you hear that and you're nodding, that's exactly right, you're probably an individualist person in an individualist society.

Collectivism, on the other hand, motivates different ways of thinking about people and different values. So, in terms, they would think in terms of group goals and achievement. The idea of not independence, but interdependence, an identity not as an I, but as a we or an us. Conforming to a group or society is very important, and so, values, like being creative and being different matter less. There's more of a distinction probably because of the focus on groups. There's more of a distinction with your in group, the group you belong to, and out group, those who don't belong to your group. And working with others and cooperating is the norm. So to refuse to cooperate and, and wanting to be independent or stand out is seen, by people from within the society, as shameful. You know, everybody must rely on each other for support. 

Now, you know, this is a broad way of thinking and you might think its, sort of, it's a stereotype in, in, in a clear sense, which is, you're taking enormous numbers of people. Countries upon countries and continents and saying, you guys you're individualistic, you're collectivist. But, there's some truth to this. There's some to truth to this from people who analyze that, the how societies work, what people say about societies, that they live in, and also, from experimental studies. So, for instance, some of these studies typically contrast, the United States, again, a very individualist country, versus China or India, which are more collectivist. And you ask people to do simple things, you ask them to describe this image, this fish tank. And it turns out that American subjects, when when describing thif, this fish tank, would tend to start off by talking about the fish, the individual fish, they'll describe the fish. Individuals from collectivist societies are more likely to describe, not the, the specific individuals in the scene, but rather, the relationships that they fall into. 

We'll take another example. You give people a, a triad of some notepaper, a newspaper, and a pencil. And you say, there's three items here, which two go together? Well, there's been a lot of studies done, and people from a society like United States will tend to say, you know, the notepaper and the newspaper go together because they're both made of paper. They both fall into the same category. Well, individuals from more collectivist societies would tend, often, to say, well, say that the the pencil goes with the notepaper, because you could use the pencil to write on notepaper. It's now not the category that matters, but the relationship between the two things. Plainly, there's no right answer here. But there's different ways to think about the question, and those different ways will, sort of, tap what you think is important. And such studies find that categorization and individuality is important for people, from some parts of the world, but relationships and dependence, interaction, is important from other parts of the world. 

It shouldn't be hard to see how this could connect to moral issues. so, for instance, in one study, Morris and Peng, did series of experiments which, which contrasted people in China, collectivist, versus people in United States, individualistic. And, what they found was, that when it came to reporting, talking about moral actions or bad moral, bad moral acts, the Chinese would tend to focus on interactions, on situational causes, while the Americans would tend to focus on on internal causes. And this was found not only in, sort of, in how people would respond in the lab, also found in newspaper reports. So, you know, roughly, you pick up a Chinese newspaper, you hear about a murder, they'll tell you about where he was raised, who was around him, what were the forces shaping his life? An American, we're more like, there was this guy, and he, and this is, and, and these are his grievances and this is, this is his upbringing, and this is where he comes from. It's all about him, and a lot less about the context that surrounds him. 

#### Tight vs. Loose

You could split up the world into societies that are tight versus societies that are loose. Where, what they did was, they took people from 33 nations, a nice, diverse, very large sample, and asked them, sort of, questions about how, how tight or how loose their society is. And, and here's what I mean by tight or loose. So for instance, they would ask them questions like there are many social norms that people are supposed to abide by, in this country. Do you strongly disagree, moderately disagree, slightly agree, strongly agree? And this isn't, so, so how much is there to this social norms? Social norms, if there's a lot of norms you're tight, if there's fewer, you're loose. To go back to the end in this country, if someone acts in an inappropriate way, others will strongly disapprove. 

Again, in a, in a tight place, you'd imagine people would say, yes, they would strongly disapprove, in a loose place, eh, people do what they want. They also ask them to rate the appropriateness of 12 behaviors across 15 situations. The behaviors included eating, laughing, kissing, reading a newspaper, flirting, bargaining. And the situations ranged from being at the bank, being at a restaurant, the city sidewalk, a workplace, a movie. So you have 180 combinations. And this is another way of measuring, how loose a society, how much can they get away with? How restr, and that would make them loose, how restricted are they in what they can do? And that would make them tight. 

Now it turns out, which is really cool, that the ratings cohere. And this goes back to the question of whether or not there's systematicity in differences. So you could've imagined it's all random. What a country thinks about how you act on a beach had nothing to do with what a country thinks about how you act on a city sidewalk. What we think about whether or not people disapprove of, of certain social acts has nothing to do with, with behavior in different contexts. But of course, this isn't how it worked. The questions would cohere. People would, countries would show a certain co, consistency, such that, it made sense to put them on a continuum from very tight to very loose. And then, some interesting findings come out from this. __So, if you factor out GDP, roughly factor how rich a country is, it turns out tight countries have more autocratic rule, less open media, fewer rights and liberties, more police, less crime, and more religion. Now, none of these things are the things that, that people were asked. But it turned out their answers, on how loose and how tight their country was, predicted these facts about a country.__ 

They asked, why are some countries tight and other countries loose? And, the theory they came up with was, that tightness is a response to threat. So, if things, if things are going badly, for internal reasons or external reasons,, the country will tighten up behavior as a part of a way to respond to it. And, exactly, how that works and exactly why that works is an interesting topic in itself. __But, what they find is, that the countries that are tight have a higher population density, fewer natural resources, less available food, more natural disasters, more war, and more disease.__ And this is extremely interesting work because it takes the, these fundamentally fascinating questions such as, why are people like that? Why are the Japanese this way, and the Canadians that way, and, and Argentinians that way? You know, we could explain it. We could categorize it. And to some extent, we could explain the forces that made them what they are. 

#### Types of Ethics (Shweder)

The third way to divvy up countries brings us back to a person we've discussed before, the anthropologist Richard Shweder. Shweder speculates that there are three, moral foundations, there are three types of ethics, that we can draw upon. 

There's an ethics of community, which involves how you think of yourself relative to other people of a community. Notions like hierarchy, notions like your in-group versus your out-group. There's an ethics of autonomy, or individual rights. And there's an ethics of divinity involving issues of purity and sanctity. 

And Shweder argues that some countries emphasize some of these virtues over others. And, you know, he said, he pointed out that in America, in most of America, we strongly emphasize autonomy, individual rights. We have a language of rights a language of fairness and care, but not so much in terms of notions like community, not so much in terms of notions of divinity. These notions he pointed are not absent, and we're going to see them later on. But they're not, they don't tend to be enmeshed in law or enmeshed in custom the same way. And they also don't tend to be as enmeshed in everyday moral intuitions. 

So he did some field work here. He did some field work in the United States and I, in a specific, I, I think it may well have been Chicago, and somewhere in India, a small village in India. And to illustrate these differences, he gave people moral scenarios. Said here's a scenario, you think this is right or you think it's wrong? And he found that there was systematic differences, in how people responded to the scenarios. So, here's some of his examples. I'm going to give you some cases that everybody thought was wrong, the Americans thought were wrong and the Indians thought were wrong. Case one, while walking, a man saw a dog sleeping in the road. He walked up to it and kicked it. Everybody finds that wrong. 

Or here's another one, a father said to his son, if you do well on the exam, I will buy you a pen. The son did well on the exam, but the father did not give him anything. Wrong. 

And, and I would think that finding these sorts of things wrong may well be human universals. __To intentionally harm something that may be beloved, to to lie, to break a promise for no reason at all. A large part, what I think it is to be human is to be bothered by that.__ 

But Shweder was more interested, as we are here, in the differences. So here are some examples of of, of cases were people differed. A young married woman went alone to see a movie without informing her husband. When she returned home, her husband said, if you do it again, I will beat you black and blue. She did it again. He beat her black and blue. What do you think of the husband? Americans thought the husband was terrible. The Indians did not. The Indians thought he did nothing wrong. A man that had a married son and a married daughter. After his death, his son claimed most of the property. His daughter got little. Judge the son. Americans thought the son was doing something wrong, it was not equitable. The Indians thought it was fine. This is how we do things. This is, there's differences between how you treat men and women. And these differences are morally okay. 

In these examples, the Americans found these things wrong, the Indians did not. But other examples are sort of flipped. In a family, a 25 year old son addresses his father by his first name. Americans say, huh, that's fine. Indians said, it's disrespectful. A woman cooked rice and went to eat with her brother, husband, and elder brother, then she ate with them. Americans say, what could be wrong with that? Indians say, you're violating rules for how you should be socializing. A woman in your community eats fish two or three times a week. Americans say huh, what's wrong with that? Turns out, that in Indian culture, that, that, that Sweder studied, fish is thought to have aphrodisiac-ical properties can encourage lust, and so, it's very wrong. After defecation, a woman did not change her clothes before cooking. Again, Americans go, huh? The Indian population Shweder studies said, this is wrong. There are certain rules about purity and cleanliness, and this women is vi, intentionally violating them. 

__Shweder suggested that each of these three moral foundations, that express themselves in different ways across different countries, has a corresponding emotion. And this is known as the CAD triad or CAD triad.__

#### Community. Autonomy. Divinity.

If this works out this way, it's a beautiful miracle of English that, that the names of the emotions correspond, in first letters, to the name of the type of morality. So violations of community elicits emotions of contempt. Somebody who turns his back on this country, I feel contempt towards him. Violations of autonomy elicit emotions of anger. Someone slaps a child for no reason, cheats somebody else, anger. While violations of divinity someone has sex with a sheep, someone someone eats the wrong thing, does the wrong thing in some way that's disgusting, elicits emotion of disgust. Well, this brings our quick survey of different theories as to how societies differ, it brings it to an end. But we're going to see the CAD triad again, because we're going to start to revisit the same sorts of issues, some of the same theories, when we move away from societal differences and then move to explore differences within societies, within countries. And that will the topic of the next lecture.

## 4 - 3 - 4.3 - Conservatives and Liberals - 18_34

I live in New Haven, Connecticut, which is a city in the East Coast of the United States. As an exercise I thought of where my own society fits as a society. Using theories we talked about in last lecture, so we're plainly individualistic. We're not very collectivist. We're plainly autonomy oriented. The ethics that we use is an ethics of rights and fairness. If, if I tried to persuade somebody that they should do something because it's right and it's right because of what God believes or it's right because of respect for our Country or something, they would roll their eyes at me. Are you moral arguments in my society take place over questions over people's freedom, people's liberties. Notions of equity, and fairness, and sympathy, and care. Autonomy, notion. Non-community notions and non-divinity notions. I'm not sure whether we're tight or loose. 

I've been to tighter places like Tokyo. I've been to looser places like Guadalajara. So we're sort of probably in between. But the exercise of figuring out where your country stands on the, these parameters and where your society stands. Makes you realize that, that the, the, sort of how crude it is to say a whole swath of countries, you guys are this and you guys are that. To talk about the West versus the East in such a way that treats China and India, for instance, as morally indistinguishable is maybe a useful first pass, but in the end we're just going to have to get a lot sharper. Even within a country, so, so, the, the, the moral system of Americans as a whole, may well be different than the moral systems of Indians as a whole. But plainly within the United States, over all sorts of moral issues your average resident of Connecticut, where I am, is going to reason differently than your average resident of Alabama. Or Colorado. Or Texas. New Mexico. You have these different places which have these, their own politics, their own moral views. It's not, the differences by world standards are not huge. But they're there and they're quite interesting. There's variation within an-, any society. And, and so, any proper theory of moral psychology will have to help us understand not only the ways in which Americans are different from Chinese. But also ways in which people from the American South are different from America North. And how I'm different from my neighbor down the road. 

And and, and as a way to explore this, I want to zoom in on an American case. With apologies for people who are less familiar with the American case but it, it, it's an area where we've done a lot of study. And I think it's quite likely that some of the conclusions from this American case could extend more broadly. We'll look at an American case of a specific sort of moral difference. And, as a way to introduce this difference, I've put up here some. __Some issues that people have moral opinions about. I, I begin with God, guns, and gays. It's a, it's a famous appr, expression. It was first used to my knowledge by a republican senator in the 1990s, who announced his platform, was he was going to run on God, guns, and gays. And what he meant was he was going to argue that religion is very important. And it's important for morality.__ It's something which should be respected, it should be listened to. Guns, we should have rights for guns. He was very much against restriction on gun laws. And as for gays homosexuality was viewed as a sin. Seemed morally wrong to be a, to be shunned socially, but also blocked by the force of law. And so the, the phrase because of the pleasant alliteration of gods guns, should just be God probably. 

God, guns, and gays has stopped. Then they have others. Abortion, capital punishment, health care, affirmative action, foreign aid. These are political issues, these are social issues, but they're fundamentally moral issues. You, your view on any of these topics will turn on your notions of what's right and wrong. And although some morality might be universal, the fact that we're going to fight about these suggests that, at least here, they aren't universal. There really are differences. 

What's interesting, and what's obvious to anybody who's, who's observed politics, is that ones views on these issues are not independent. More you, you, you're stance on moral issues, connects in interesting ways. So for instance if I know somebody in America is pro-gun. They are very much against gun control laws, they think Americans should have the right to bear arms and this right should not be infringed in even the slightest way by governments. Suppose I know that, I could guess that they are against abortion. I could guess they don't believe women should have a so called right to chose. Now I might be wrong, its a statistical guess, but it's not a bad guess. If, if I hear someone is very much in favor of socialized medicine in the United States, in which the government takes care of all health care, a single-payer system known as, I could guess that they are in favor of gay marriage Somebody who is obsessed with the idea of strongly military is probably against affirmative action. Again, these aren't perfect, but they are reliable. You can take moral issues that aren't obviously connected, like healthcare and gay marriage, and find connections. 

So what explains this? __Well, a lot of the variation in peoples'moral views, a lot of the what could cause people to, to kind of go from, from this position, to a series of moral issues, to this position, can be captured on a single parameter. This parameter, as if you would turn a single knob, your views on all sorts of issues will go with that turn. And this parameter is entirely familiar. It goes under some slightly different names, but we give you it here as a contrast between liberal and conservative.__ So you can take college undergraduates, or older people, or the whole country for that matter, and ask everybody where do you fall on that scale. Are you a conservative, either very conservative, conservative, slightly conservative. Are you liberal, very liberal, liberal, slightly liberal. Are you in that middle part are you a moderate. And it turns out that people's answer to that single question, that single very crude question, predicts a lot of things about their moral views. 

So why is that so? To put it another way, what is it to be a conservative or a liberal? What goes in the heads of people who have conservative viewpoints as opposed to those who have liberal viewpoints? Well, because conservative and liberal are political terms among other things, they, they represent groups that are in constant clashing. And because they're of different moral positions, they also represent views that are in constant conflict. We don't tend to like so much people who hold very different views than we do. Particularly, when we're fighting over the question of which views get to hold sway over our laws and our policies. So, if you ask a liberal they may tell, explain to you, that conservatives, the conservative psychology what goes on their heads could be explained fairly simply. They are selfish and simple minded. If you ask a conservative, the conservative might point out that the liberal is an immature bleeding heart. Someone, someone so overwhelmed by, by empathy and care that they can' think intelligently about hard problems. Conservatives are said to be greedy and uncaring about others. While, liberals are failures trying to leech of the successful. If you ask many, if you ask people on one side, they will say their side is rational, the other side is emotional. If you ask people on the other, they will tell you the other thing. Everyone sees themselves as the rational agents and sees their opponents as people swayed unreasonably by weird emotions, and agendas, and ideas. 

In the end, I think, at the deepest level, there is a temptation to see those of, those who have different political or moral views and simply evil. This may be enjoyable. I don't think it's, it, it, it is within your own in-group to castigate the other group and mock the other group as a source of tremendous fun. I won't deny indulging in it sometimes myself. But it's not how science is done. As science is done it's kind of an empirical interesting question. 

How do you characterize these different political makeups? And this is, this is a question of, I'd describe it as a question of science political psychology maybe, but neuroscience these days. But of course it's a broad question. The question of the nature of political differences. Particularly those political differences that correspond to moral differences is one that has engaged all sorts of people including political scientists, economists, philosophers, and alike. 

So let's look at a few, a few ideas here. One idea is proposed by Thomas Sowell. And Sowell suggests that liberals and conservatives have different world views. __Very broadly, conservatives have a constrained vision and liberals have an unconstrained vision. And a better way to put this is conservatives have a tragic vision of human nature. liberals, a Utopian vision.__ The psychologist Jonathan Haidt, nicely sums it up by associating the conservative view with a quote from Immanuel Kant. "Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made."And he associate, associates the liberal view with the stylings of John Lennon and, particularly, the song, "Imagine". If I was there to try to sing "Imagine", well, first, you won't want to hear it and, second, I'd probably entering some sort of copyright violations. So I'll see if I can get away with just reading aloud, just two parts of it. Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try. No hell below us, above us, only sky. Imagine there are no countries, it isn't hard to do. Nothing to kill or die for, and no religion, too. And if you were to pull people and say, you know, John Lennon or Immanuel Kant. You'd probably get answers that would, sort of, relate in a fairly clear way to their political leanings. 

In general, one could argue that, that because of this tragic vision, utopian vision difference. All sorts of things follow. It follows that conservatives would be more sympathetic towards tradition. Especially religious tradition, because, because, if, if, something has been around for a long time and its kept us surviving, we kept going with it, we should be, we should be very loath to give it up. We are on a precipice And, you don't start messing around when you're on a precipice. On the other hand, if you're liberal, you may have more enthusiasm for trying new things. For top down solutions. For Utopian ideas of intellectuals and scientists for how to reshape us, make us kinder to others. Make us less racist. Make us better people. And so some of these things could correspond legitimately from these broader views of human nature, that go on with liberals and with conservatives. 

Now, I'm not sure how happy people would be though with this analysis, it's controversial for many reasons. For one thing, it, one could always tell a story for why a given conservative view. Well, that could naturally follow from a tragic view on human nature. While a given liberal view could naturally come from utopian view of human nature, but it's kind of easy to tell these stories. 

And the problem is that there is not as regular a connection between specific views and liberals versus conservatives, as some people seem to believe. __So for instance, liberals once adopted views that conservatives now adopt, and vice versa.__ So notions of IQ testing, which are now largely hated by liberals were once a very liberal Idea. notions, certain ideas about healthcare which were once championed by conservatives are now championed by liberals and hated by conservatives. It's also not clear how well this sort of continuum as I've been describing it works for other countries. You don't want a political psychology that's entirely geared towards the United States of America. Because to the extent it captures real facts about how we think and how we and, and, and our moral sense, you'd want it to apply more, more broadly. 

So, many Americans identify themselves as libertarians. And libertarians don't really fit on the scale. Libertarians, for instance, are very much in favor of gay rights, including gay rights to marry, if, if people can marry, because because they, they are totally against intervention of all sorts. Another hand they're very against things like socialized medicine because they are highly skeptical of a government intervention. 

So its not clear that people political views clearly fall into a liberal, John Lennon, versus conservative, Immanuel Kant perspective. Let's explore a different approach, not necessarily rejecting the Thomas Sowell ideal, which may have a lot of truth to it, but maybe supplementing it or expanding upon on it. And this different view bring, brings us back once again to Shweder. So Shweder talked about three sorts of ethics, community, autonomy and divinity. And he argued that these ethics were emphasized in different ways in the countries around the world. Where United States is, is famously and exceptionally obsessed with autonomy over overriding everything else. 

Well, Jonathan Haidt, who was Shweder's student. and, and who is an extremely influential moral psychologist and we've seen his views earlier in this lecture series, earlier in this class. And he argues that we can adopt Shweder's perspective and extend it to not just differences across different countries, but to differences within the United States. And so he takes Shrader's view and he slightly re, re, restructures it in terms of five moral foundations. So instead of community, there's the moral foundation of authority, which relates to the notion of hierarchy and, and who you're, who's above you and who's below you. And ingroup, which captures the notion that part of an ethics of community is notions like patriotism. Or the, the evils of betrayal. Autonomy relates to different notions involving care and fairness. And and divinity involved notions of purity and sanctity. So, what Haidt did and he has done a lot of work since then but here is a classic study, which I want to focus on. Is he just got people to rank themselves as to how where they stood on the scale from very liberal and very conservative. And just ask, how seriously do you take these different moral foundations. How seriously do you take harm and fairness? Which correspond to, to Shweder's anatomy ethics. How seriously do you take in group and authority? Which correspond to Shweder's community. And how strong do you take purity? Which corresponds to Shweder's ethics of divinity. 

And here are the results. And as you'll see, they're quite striking. The conservatives more or less rank them all the same, the conservatives take all of these moral foundations seriously. The liberals, particularly the very liberals are different. __The very liberal liberals take harm and fairness, as extremely morally important. But other values, in group authority purity, much less so. Haidt goes on to argue that, what we see in American conservatives, is the pattern we see all around the world. Where most people around the world take all of these values seriously, to some extent or another.__ What we see in liberals is a very unusual case where an ethics of autonomy. Notions of the wrongness of harm, the importance of fairness, are privileged powerfully over other ethical principles. And this graph is going to lead us to certain questions we could ask about the details of these moral foundations. Which will, be the topic of our next two classes.

## 4 - 4 - 4.4 - Disgust and Honor I - 19_53

And I think it becomes interesting to sort of Look at some specific studies and kind of focus a little bit more. I'll talk about two of them. The first is purity or sanctity. And I'm just going to talk about this very briefly, because in the very first week, we kind of talked about the case of disgust where we looked at the role of disgust plays in morality. And that's the theme here. 

So, so, it's clear that certain violations of purity, certain things people do, or ways in which we can see people, or the way people act or even think, can give rise to disgust. Now, this emotion of disgust gives rise to moral disapproval. When you think it's wrong. Now there are many domains to discuss which applies, but it's most morally relevant in the domain of sex. It explains our reaction to sexual promiscuity, bestiality, to incest. Even consensual incest between adults can give rise to moral disapproval, in part because it just disgusts us. And certainly it gives rise to our feelings about homosexuality. In fact, customs and practices and laws, regarding the, the rights, or lack of rights of homosexuals, is a major way in which societies differ. There are societies in the world right now where to be found to be gay is punishable by death. There are other societies where maybe it's not punishable by death, but it's illegal. And in fact in the United States in which I, I lived in many years, until fairly recently in historical times, in some parts of the United States, it was illegal too. There were sodomy laws that were enforced, although sodomy could apply to both men and women, they were always enforced against gay men. And now on the other extreme there are, are places in the world, including where I now live, where not only is homosexual sex legal, but actually gay people can marry. Gay people have all of the rights and privileges of straight people. But even within our society there's, there's huge moral differences. And in fact many people who believe that gay people should have the right to marry, still if you ask them will say that they think homosexuality is morally wrong. And this is a major way in which people who describe themselves as liberals differ from people who describe themselves as conservatives. 

And it might be that we could give some sort of explanation for why this difference arises, for how, and, and, and I think that there are two sorts of exclamations. __One is what we saw from the graph from Jonathan Haidt from, from last lecture, which is that when you ask people how important is, purity. Conservatives say it is pretty important. People who, who are very conservative say purity is a value, is important. That disgust should play a role in our moral evaluations. Liberals tend to dismiss it. Liberals say that doesn't matter as much. And, so, so, one thing is, for whatever reason, and it's, it's an open question, conservative ideology is wrapped around a view that gives value to the feeling of disgust. While liberal ideology is, is less prone to do so.__ 

__A second difference, and this is actually came up in some research that I've been involved in, with David Pizarro and Yulen Enbar, and other scientist, is that people who are politically conservative, people who categorize themselves as politically conservative, tend to be more disgust sensitive than people who are politic, politically liberal.__ Now, again, it's a mystery exactly why this is so, but the fact is reasonable strong. And so there's two reasons why, you may get more repugnance toward certain sex acts by people who characterize themselves as politically conservative. __One is they tend to be more sensitive to disgust, and two is they take disgust more seriously. So, to the extent that disgust drives your moral approbation, you would expect it to, to, to differ along these political lines.__ 

The second domain I want to discuss doesn't actually fall cleanly or simply into any of the, the descriptions of moral difference that we've talked about before, not tight loose, not individualistic, collectivist. Not Haidt's taxonomy or Shwader's taxonomy, but it's very important, and it's a notion that can be summed up with one word: honor. __So, some societies and some people take honor very seriously. For honor is commonly seen as a male virtue, in that it manifests itself in terms of violence and courage. It shows up in different ways in women where it involves sort of, restraint on sexuality, notions of purity, and notions of family. And when you see honor talked about and sketched out both in historical times and in some modern societies you often see more of a sex difference than in societies that, that, that don't count honor. Honor is, is intimately related to sex roles.__

Now, the society in which I live in, is, sort of, the East Coast United States, is a textbook example of society, where honor does not play a big role. As we'll see, other parts of the United States, honor is taken much more seriously. But, still, for me, for my neighbors, I think, for all of us, we can resonate to displays of honor. 

It, it, it, we'd, there's a, sort of, moral sensitivity that hasn't gone away. And, sometimes it shows up in, in the shows we enjoy watching. So there's a lot of ingredients to the honorable man, the honorable person here. Raylan is defending the honorable of a woman who's not present, but he is defending her honor. He's brave. He is squaring off to fight against two men. He loses by the way. He loses but what's, because it is important to the show that he loses, the set up and other things that follow. But the way he loses, and you could have predicted this a mile away, is that they fight dirty. He beats them fair and square then one of them sneaks up behind him and hits him with a board. because he's honorable, and they are not. 

So, this is an extreme example, but in general honor plays a major role in our lives, even among those of us who don't, yh, view ourselves as falling into a culture of honor. in, in their wonderful book, Homicide, __Martin Daley and Margot Wilson point out that the major cause of murder isn't big things. It's not huge battles and conflicts over important things. Very often it's an insult. It's a curse, it's a petty infraction, it's something that shows a lack of respect. When faced with a lack of respect, people, men, feel the need to retaliate, often murderously and, and Daly and Wilson trace this tendency back, to a time before, before police, before 911, before civil courts, before courts of law.__ They write, in chronically feuding and warring societies, an essential manly virtue is the capacity for violence. To turn to the other cheek is not saintly but stupid or contemptibly weak. This propensity for violence is needed in a society, without law. 

In a society where you cannot count on the law, and when you think of it that way, it becomes clear that importance that honor is given depends on the culture, and there are so-called cultures of honor. __So, cultures of honor are cases where you can't rely on the law.__ So, if you're in a criminal gang and someone, steals your stuff or you know, or, or tries to assault your, your, your wife or show some disrespect. You can't call the cops. You have to take things into your own hand. __Also, cultures of honor are also associated with cases where, your resources are easily taken, like herders.__ Again if, if your resources are vulnerable to being taken by anybody, you have to have a reputation that will deter them from doing so. In general a reputation for excessive violent retaliation in certain circumstances is a necessary strategy for maintaining a, a happy and safe life. 

Examples of cultures of honor include Western cowboys, they include Scottish highlanders, masai warriors, bedouin tribesmen. __But interestingly they also include something which is a little bit more close to home, which is the American South. So, the American South were, was settled by herdsman and there was, for long period, less centralized legal control. And so, so the prediction that this makes is that the American South would be more prone to have a culture of honor, than other parts of America. And a prediction that would make from a psychologists standpoint, somebody interested in the psychology of morality, and moral reasoning, is that people who come from the American South, who live there, will reason differently about the right thing to do than people who don't come from there.__ 

And, in fact, this was, the topic of a wonderful book called Culture of Honor that reports all sorts of experiments to test these ideas. So, it turns out, for instance, that people in, in the South have, are very much more in favor of corporal punishment and capitol punishment. They understand that, they believe that bad acts have to have a serious consequence. They have much more respect towards the military. They have very different attitudes about foreign policy, about the treatments of countries. They are more forgiving towards crimes of honor. So, it's not like there's sort of more, more condemnation towards everything. In one study psychologists, these guys sent out letters, where they would send it out to different places asking whether there's a job. And the letters were concocted that in one case, the person who's asking for job says, look I've got to tell you something I was arrested for a crime, and I forget what the crime was but it was something like I stole cars or something. Nobody wanted to hire that guy, not in the north or not in the south. In the other letter the guy tells a story, says I have to tell you something. I've been in prison for murder, but I gotta explain why. I was in a bar, and then this guy started talking, and the guy said, they're making fun of me, and they said he slept with my fiancee, went on and on about that, disrespecting me. So, there was a fight and I killed him. 

There, you get a difference, prospective, employers in the North didn't want this guy. They didn't respond back, but those in the South often did. They had a very different response. They wrote back to him saying look, we understand, I know it's terrible, but we think you did the right thing, come, come work with us, we'll talk. __There's a different attitude in a culture of honor than a non culture of honor. Cultures of honor have higher rates of violence but again only in certain circumstances. In fact, it's often said and I'm not sure there's much evidence for this, that these cultures of honor actually make people very polite. Because if you're in a society which has the possibility of violent retaliation, you're nice to people.__ Because, because in, you know, unless there's a very special circumstance, you don't want to trigger the, the, the violent retaliation. I had a friend of mine I was in Arizona for many years and, University of Arizona in Tuscon, wonderful place, and I had a friend of mine from New York City. And she was so frustrated because when driving everyone was so nice and she was afraid to give anybody the finger, which she did in some frequency in New York. Because people in Tuscon carry guns. So, she was afraid if she gave someone the finger they would start, you know, firing at her. So, she had to be polite. 

But, that sort of, for better or worse, that's a consequence of culture of honor, which is people, because the threat of violence is there, people are nice to each other. The results when experiment report in this book. When an amazing study that, that went beyond survey data and went beyond, asking people to respond to letters, but actually looked at how people in the real world responded to an offense against their honor. So, they tested University of Michigan Undergraduates. All of them were white, all of them were male, They were not Hispanic and they were not Jewish. They wanted a homogeneous sample. But the idea is that some of them were from the South and some of them weren't. And then they gave them a provocation and the provocation was very clever. They had them, they had all the subjects, separately, go into a room and they'd fill out some papers and so on. And then they, they were told by an administrator, could you go down the hall to that room and finish the study, okay? And they start walking back, and as they were walking back, a graduate student, it's always the same guy. He's kind of in a hurry. He walks past the, the experimental subject, bumps him and says, asshole. And keeps walking. And then the question is, how did our experimental subject respond? And it turned out that as predicted they, there were big differences. Nobody was so pleased with it, but the subjects that weren't from the South often laughed it off, and whatever. The subjects from the South, when they were later tested, as a result of this action had lower self esteem, they had a rise in testosterone as well in cortisol, a stress hormone. And later on when given the opportunity to show dominate behavior they were more likely to. They, they had something that they needed to, to make up for. 

This is an example of how culture can, can pervade psychology. It can in affect and influence how we think. Now, I've talked a bit about purity and honor. And what I want to emphasize is. And I've talked about cultures of honor and I've talked about groups where purity is taken very seriously.__But what I want to emphasize is that taking purity seriously or taking honor seriously is not an all or nothing matter. It's on a continuum. So, if you're from a certain secular, liberal, autonomy-oriented society, you may dismiss purity in disgust. But still, if you hear that somebody's having sex with a cow then, you kind of, you know, that's, you know, most of us would feel, there's something kind of wrong with that.__ It's gross and just nah. So, so, so, even though it's not a major part of your moral system, you still resonate to it. You might dismiss honor. You may say, honor is sexist. It leads to too much violence. It's the wrong thing to do. But still, you might have a rush of moral appreciation for the brave hero who acts. The daughter in True Grit, who wants to kill the man who killed her father. You might say, oh that's an awful way to create a society. But I, I think few of us won't feel some sort of rush of appreciation and delight for this manifestation of honor. And this sort of thing is pretty typical of moral differences. If you give it a cursory look, it looks like people just do weird things and believe weird things. But when you look at things closely and start to understand them, you'll see that, that to some extent, these differences, while they exist aren't all that different from how we ourselves think. Although we might ultimately reject them it makes it easier to have some sympathy, for them.

## 4 - 5 - 4.5 - Disgust and Honor II - 15_24

So, in this brief lecture I'm going to stick with, purity and honor, but I'm going to shift gears. Early on we made a distinction between descriptive questions and normative questions. Descriptive questions concern, how do things work, what are they about. Their questions of science and this is what, this class has been all about. Normative questions are questions how should we live. What's the right thing to do? And for the most part I have been trying to veer away from them, but here for the purpose of this short lecture I want to get into normative issues. 

I want to sort of ask the question, what should we think about purity and honor. Should we value them? now, when making these, asking these questions, we have to tread very carefully. It's very difficult to do this sort of project, I think, in an intelligent way. I mean, for one thing, somebody's else's morality will inevitably fall short by the standards of your own morality. Because someone else's morality will have, by definition if it's a different morality, will have values that you might not necessarily share. So if I was to say oh honor and purity a defender of honor and purity says look one of the values, one of the advantages of honor and purity is that it helps us protect female sexual modesty. Well I could respond by saying I don't, who cares about female sexual modestly. All that matters is whether women have the same freedom, and, and, and autonomy, and so forth. Who cares about that? But the champion of honor and purity may say well I care. Not only do I care, but that's, that's a value which I take seriously, and it's a value that my morality endorses. And so, like they said on the clip in Justified, we're at an impasse. 

But I don't really think it's always as bad as all that. __One reason why it's possible to challenge moral views, or to champion moral views, to compare and contrast different moral views, is that people do share a lot. And there one could make arguments that, that could appeal to to beliefs and premises that, that both the participants share.__ So for instance you could say to somebody look, we both value X, well your morality falls short of achieving X. So for instance, you know, if, if somebody's moral system, I made a case, if somebody's moral system caused needless suffering, I'm pretty sure they would agree yeah, that's a bad thing about my moral system. They might argue that it has other positive traits that override it. But still we could all agree needless suffering is bad and so, so that would be one way to evaulate a moral system. 

Another way is consistency, where if, if you could argue that their moral system gives rise to moral conclusions, that they are entirely sure are wrong, this could lead them to distrust other aspects of the system. That's all vague but I'll, I'll give a more concrete example. Because I think these sort of arguments could be made against purity. Against a sort of morality that revolves around sanctity, divinity, purity and disgust. That connects to our beliefs particularly, but other people's sexual practices. 

Now purity has its defenders. So remember, many people who characterize themselves as very conservative give purity a considerable amount of, of, of value. and, and you know, brilliant scholars, like Leon Kass, have written, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond wisdom's power completely to articulate it. So Kass says we should listen to disgust. Disgust could tell us, give us moral insights. I actually think that there's two arguments against this view. And I'll present both of them. One is that disgust has had a horrible history. 

So, so now I'm sort of repeating things that we'd introduced in the first week, but I'll, I'll read again a quote by, by Martha Nussbaum. Throughout history, certain disgust properties, sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness, have repeatedly and monotonously been associated with Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people, all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body. Disgust has lead us to more, to, to, to moral decisions and moral acts, morally motivated acts, that everybody today would agree are horrible. There's nobody seriously, certainly not Kass, certainly not anybody else, who says, we were right to be disgusted at the idea of interracial marriage. But, we were and so the concern is if disgust has led us wrong in the past, how can we rely on it now? That is some of you would want to make the argument that, when I think about gay people being married, I feel disgust. And I take that as a reasonable guide that something has gone wrong here. The problem with that argument is that 30, 40 years ago people said exactly the same thing about interracial marriage. But all of us, including you, know that interracial marriage, there's nothing wrong with it. And so, so, if one is going to rely on disgust, say as an argument against gay marriage, then one has, then, then, it, it is necessary to show how the disgusted people feel towards gay marriage, is somehow different then the disgust that people felt towards interracial marriage. 

Now I want to be clear. I'm not here arguing for one position or another. __But my point is that if disgust is your motivating force for for, for your moral view, you have to explain why you take it seriously now when you don't take it seriously for its consequences in the past.__ And there's another argument which concerns the, the evolution of disgust, and here as in other places, we see that the normative and descriptive aren't quite so different as one would imagine. Because often descriptive factors enter into normative considerations and normative arguments. And in particular the, the standard account of where our discussed feelings come from, the account that I talked about in week one, the account that is supported by many scholars like Paul Rozin John Haidt, Dan Kelly, is that we have disgust to motivate avoidance of parasites and poison. It, it, we are grossed out by feces, we are grossed out by rotten meat, by urine, by, by vomit, and so on. Because we don't want to eat those things. And being grossed out is, is ev, ev, evolution's way of keeping us away from those things. 

The fact that we find people disgusting, and what people do disgusting, is an accident. And so, if this is true, and it's an empirical claim, one could develop another better theory perhaps. But if this is true, if this is the best theory we have, then there's no reason to rely on disgust as a moral guide. Because it hasn't evolved to be responsive to what we value as moral goods. __And in this regard disgust is different from other moral faculties we have. Like empathy, or even guilt, or shame, or anger which can go awry, but those seem to be genuinely moral emotions. And that the reason why we have guilt and shame and anger has to do with our interactions with people. Doesn't mean that they're always good moral guides, but it does suggest that they're worth taking seriously. There's nothing in the emotion of disgust to believe that it's worth taking seriously.__

What about honor? Well honor has its critics. I think one of the, the best critics is Steven Pinker in his recent book Better Angels of Our Nature, where he chronicles the decline of violence over human history. For an enormous decline it of, of how much we murder each other. __And part of his argument is that the decline of violence is in part due to a, a cultural shift regarding honor. And in particular a shift from a culture of honor, which leads to retaliation. It leads to payback. It leads to war. To what he would call a culture of dignity, where violence is less of a thing.__ Where actually violence might look foolish. It might, you might want to seem you're above violent retaliation. He nicely illustrates this by a, a great, quote from the Russian leader Khrushchev. So at one point Khrushchev says I'm not some Czarist officer who has to kill himself if he farts at a fancy party. It's better to back down than to go to war. What he means is he's not some putz who has to, who is so caught up in honor that somebody offends him he has to jump in and do battle. He's above that. 

And being above that, Pinker argues, is one reason why the world is, is strange though it seems a safer and, and more peaceful place. If you find a Pinker claim implausible, if you say what do you mean the world's a safer, more peaceful place. That's fine. This'll be a topic we're going to move to as we approach our final lectures. So we'll get more into this claim about the decline of violence. __What's important now is the idea that honor is an accelerant to violence.__ 

But on the other hand, one could defend honor and one can defend honor and defend cultures of honor in one of two ways I think. One can defend honor by arguing that although honor in itself may not accord with a certain secular morality. And a, a morality of autonomy. Still, honor can, can help us achieve the goals, that this ethics of autonomy is hoping to achieve. And this is a point made by Christopher Baum, who studies hunter gatherer societies. And he points out that these hunter gatherer societies are often very egalitarian. They, they, they are not, you have might have imagined because they, they are free of central government that it'd be run by a powerful alpha male man and then, alpha male person, and who would then lead over everybody. And everybody would be subservient to him and everything. __It turns out hunter gatherer societies are a bunch of people who are loosely coordinated and are kind of equal. And so you might say well, this means that members of hunter gatherer societies don't care about status. They don't care about honor and, and hierarchy.__

But Bob argues opposite. __He says that if you look at what they say and what they do, it turns out that they are obsessed with honor. They are obsessed with status. They're obsessed with hierarchy. But because of that they're all jockeying into position and nobody wants to be on the bottom.__ And so they, they're willing to group together to keep someone else from being on top. And then so through a community of people, you know, all who take status very seriously, you end up with a society which is equal. And you can argue that modern day cultures of honor, basically serve a similar role to establish in certain ways, better, more egalitarian, societies. 

Now, this isn't, this isn't an argument that a champion of honor would make. And, and so I want to sort of end by, by voicing as best I can, what someone who has a different moral view from me would express. __And, I think what, what they would point out is that people from a secular autonomy based perspective tend to be very crtiical of moral positions that rely on honor and purity. But what we're missing out is that honor and purity and related moral principles, moral foundations, are connected to a conception of a person, what it is to be a person that's much richer, than a conception you would have without it.__ To some extent, an emphasis on people, a culture of honor, or ideas some things that people do are disgusting and some things that people do are elevated, can be seen as a response to a very secular consequentialist morality where all that matters is the maximization of happiness and the satisfying of goals. 

We talked, we talked early in this class about utilitarian philosophy. And utilitarian, consequentialist philosophy is this, look what's good is what makes more, most people happy, what satisfies the most goals what avoids the most pain. But we also pointed out that age doesn't sound much like morality. Morality isn't just acting in a way that, that makes the world a better place. Rather morality is, is a way of acting to protect people's rights and freedoms, to treat them with care, and compassion, and respect. And the sort of things that we're talking about here, like purity, and divinity, and honor arguably help us escape from a sort of bloodless conception of human nature and human possibility. They arguably are linked up to a notion of a person which is more elevated, more transcendent than a secular consequentialist could ever hope to think about. And this is a nice link to the final two lectures on this week, which concerned a relationship between morality and religion.

## 4 - 6 - 4.6 - Religion and Morality I - 13_18

So there's a way to introduce this final topic. I want to show you some recent polling data. And these are responses to the question, would you vote for an otherwise qualified candidate for President if he or she were a number of different traits. So, if he or she were Catholic. And you can see, everybody would vote for a Catholic. 94%, 95% says, otherwise qualified, that's fine. Numbers as small as 4% are probably just random sampling error or people messing around. What if the person was Black? Well, still very high, 94%. Jewish, woman, it goes down. When you get to a homosexual, it's just the bare majority would vote for a gay President. But I've left out something. The group that's at the bottom, is the atheist. Athe, less than half in this poll said they would vote for an atheist. This was a couple of years ago. I've seen other polls since then that find the numbers go somewhat up. They do pass 50%. __But for the most part, a lot of people, would not vote for an atheist, to be President. This is in large part because a lot of people don't like atheists.__

There are some studies where they said, they ask about different groups. Do they share your vision of American society? Would you want your child to marry one? And, you know, there's different, you ask about, if you ask about African Americans, you ask about, about recent immigrants, about Muslims and kind of people say, I don't like that, I don't like that. But, inevitably the worst people in the world, according to their fellow citizens, are atheist. And and, and, many people would argue there's a reason for this, so, and, the, the, the popular radio host and writer Laura Schlessinger. Argues that atheists just can't be trusted. And to make this point she quotes Dostoevsky who had one of his characters say where there is no God, all is permitted. The problem with atheists is a moral problem. These people would say, because for the rest of us, for people who believe in God, we have a moral code. Not only have a moral code, but we have, we believe somebody is watching us. We might believe that there's a, a heaven for those that do good and a hell for those who don't. Atheist are scary, because they lack that. What's stopping an atheist from doing anything, anything terrible. 

Then again, religion has its critics. One of the most articulate and, and powerful critics of religion, is the late Christopher Hitchens, who wrote a wonderful book called God is not Great. The subtitle being, How Religion Poisons Everything. Hitchens writes that, religion is violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism and tribalism and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children. So you have views on both sides. An example of how you could have intelligent people disagree about religion, present very different pictures of what religion is, is is in a battle in quotes. Steven Weinberg, the great physicist writes, without it, talk about religion. Without it, you would have good people doing good things and bad people doing bad things. But for good people to do bad things, that takes religion. And then Freeman Dyson in a response, another noted scientist, in a response says. And for bad people to do good things, that takes religion.

So how do we, how do we understand the role of religion? Well, you could look at it historically, socially, what has religion done for the world? Has it made it a more moral place, has it made it a less moral place. One way to do this is you look at compilation of atrocities as in The Great Big Book of Horrible Things. If you look at this you'll see religious is to be blame for 13 out of the biggest 100 horrible things in humanity. Leading to 47 million deaths, falling behind only to Communism, which was responsible for 67 million deaths. And nobody would doubt that religion could often spark conflict. It brought horrible violent conflict between nations, it could spark all sorts of violence. 

On the other hand, religion may also be responsible for a lot of the good things in the world. Dinesh D'Souza argues, for instance, that the idea of charity, not just charity to people around you but long distance charity stems from religion. It's built from religion and it is a moral idea that, that, that religions deserve credit for. And you can then argue that, that it's not at all clear that these conflicts that are, that are presumably due to religion really do have religion as a causalation or rather are people just battling for whatever reason. And using religion as an excuse to justify their violence. You could ask then about the cultural and historical effects of religion on morality in the world. 

I'm actually of the view that this question is impossible to work through. I think it's like asking whether, how would the world be if there were three sexes? Instead of two. How would history be different if we had wings? Well, it is very hard to tell. I mean, __I mean you could imagine and imagining a world without religion is equally hard because, for as far back as we know, most people have been religious and most societies have been religious. There's always been athiests, but for the most part, the planet is, is, is religious. So it's very difficult to then try to distinguish societies that are religious from those who are atheists.__ 

For instance, societies that are now athiest. And there are some. We'll get to some. Used to be religious. They're just a couple of generations ago, from being religious. So to extend it these are good and decent and kind societies. You could still, the, the fan of religion could still argue that the morality of these societies is inherited from its religious history. 

So I'm going to turn away then from the historical question and ask, I think a simpler question, which is, what are the psychological effects of religion on morality and individual humans. So in order to frame the question, we should ask a little about what religion is, and how prevalent it is. Here's a map of the world broken up into different religions. The different religions people identify with. As you'll see, most people on Earth are religious. If I, if I went around the planet and asked people what religion do you belong to, most people will answer with a specific religion. The dominant religions are the various forms of Christianity. And the various forms of Islam, for the other religions trailing behind it at different degrees. Most Americans are certainly religions. Most Americans, for instance, believe in miracles. They believe in angels. About, two thirds of Americans believe that Jesus was raised from the dead. About three quarters of Americans believe that, that God created humans and other animals, either directly as in the literal understanding of the Old Testaments story or in some way by guiding evolution. And most Americans believe in God. Estimates of how many Americans believe in God shift of course depending on how you ask the question but they're, they're in the 90% to 95% range. If you don't believe in God and you live in the United States, you are a very unusual person. 

What about special populations of of people? Well, there has been some studies looking at the worst, most godless humans on Earth, university professors, and it turns out even here a majority of university professors see themselves as religious, either to some extent, or to a great extent. What about scientists. Well, most scientists are religious. Most people who identify themselves as scientist are religious. The one hard core, group, which is atheistic is elite scientists. So when you look at scientists at the top universities, however you judge that, you'll find about three quarters of them are agnostic or atheist. And when you look at our most illustrious academy, one of our most illustrious academy for great scientists the National Academy of Science, you'll find that 93% of members are agnostic or atheist. So there are, even in a country, even in, in a country like the United States, there are atheists, and there are communities of atheists. But, bear in mind that religion is extremely popular, extremely common around the world. 

What is religion? When we talk about religion, what do we mean? Well, we could mean all sorts of things, but it's useful to break up religion into three parts. We could be talking about religious belief, we could be talking about religious practice, or we could be talking about religious experience. 

So religious belief is for some people like the anthropologist Tyler, it's the minimum definition of religious. And when you're talking about religion, to say something is religious you say, they have to believe in spiritual beings and events. They have to believe in immaterial souls and divine agents and miracles and afterlife. That sort of thing. And it kind of makes sense. It, it's hard to call something a religion if you don't believe in anything like a, like a god or a deity or life after death. The belief is, is a fundamental part of religion. 

But then there is practice, so every religion also has, has practice. And by practice you could mean something like rituals, like the Catholic ritual of the Sacrament, or Jewish and Muslim rituals of ritual bathing. Different prayers you say, different activities you do, initiation rites, things you do upon, upon reaching puberty, things you do when you get married, things you do to the dead, and then mixed in with this is social activities. 

So, humans are social animals, and, and, and when we are with people, when we fall into a category, like Jews or, or, or you know, Christians, Catholics, Baptists, Buddhists. We tend to congregate in, in it together. And so, we might congregate in a church, or in a synagogue, or a mosque and we would, and we often socialize together. And this group identity is part and parcel of religion.

The final ingredient of religion is experience. And some way could view experience is separate from belief and separate from practice. And, and William James, the great psychologist, the great philosopher defined this as the feelings, acts, and experiences, defined religion pardon me, as the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude. So far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine.

Now, you can mix and match. So you might be religious just in the sense that you have religious beliefs. You may believe in God, for instance, but not go to church and never have any of these religious experiences. Or, you could just participate in the rituals, in a community. But not have any beliefs and not have any experiences. In my experience, a lot of secular Jews in America don't really believe in much of this stuff. Don't have these transcending experiences. But they, they go to synagogue. They participate in rituals. They. They participate in the community.

Or as the third option, you could just have the experience. So you may not have any supernatural beliefs, don't care about God, don't care about any of that, you may not join, join any religion in particular. But you might have this, this transcendent experience occasionally and maybe you might call yourself spiritual and religious in that sense. So all of this sort of sets a framework. What we've done so far is, we've summarized the sort of different views people have about whether religion is good for you, and bad for you. We've talked about the prevalence of religion, and what we mean by religion, which is sort of three different things that are related. And now, what we're in a position to do, and what we'll do for this final lecture of this week, let's look at the data. What are the effects of relgion on our morality.

## 4 - 7 - 4.7 - Religion and Morality II - 19_08

I feel compelled to warn you. This lecture's going to deal with a very important and interesting question which is the effects of religion on morality and, and how an individ-, an individual's religious belief and practice affects his or her moral lives. What I want to warn you about, is you're not going to be very happy with the answer. Not because it's going to offend you one way or another, but because it's kind of messy. And you know it, it, messiness is always interesting for somebody doing some sort of intellectual inquiry. Because you'd like to sort of neaten up and give them some clean logical discussion. But the results here a re a bit messy. That may well be that these are issues that deserve a lot more careful scrutiny and a lot more science than they have now. 

We'll start the obvious. The obvious is, there is good and bad religious people. Even Christopher Hitchens would acknowledge that there's some you know, really great people who so happen to be devoutly religious, and I would imagine even the most you know dogmatic theists would acknowledge, there's some good atheists around. So, this is the obvious. We know some things that are less obvious.

Here's the first fact that may be surprising. It involves large scale studies of, in reported in a book called Who Really Cares, and reported elsewhere. As to who gives money to charities. And, and in all of this, we'll think about non-religious charities. Who give, like, you know, save, Save the Children, and, and, and, and charities to help the infrastructure and help people in need, who gives blood, who volunteers. And then you ask the question, you know, what do these people have in common, who do good things? __It turns out that controlling for a lot of things, like education, age, gender, income, and politics, religious people give a lot more to charities, including nonreligious charities. They are more likely to volunteer, they are more likely to donate blood, and they're more likely to give for the homeless.__ Perhaps related to this, because we know that altruistic giving is related to your mood and your happiness. __The non-religious are twice as likely to the religious to say that they feel like failures, and the religious are twice as likely to say that they are very happy with their lives.__ So, it looks at this point that we've really answered the question kind of sharply, as to the effect of religion on morality, at least certain sorts of morality involving giving to strangers. and, and, and it seems clear as well that in the sample, which was United States, being religious is good for you. That's half the story.

Now here's the other half. What if we took countries, and we ranked them on how religious they are. What percentage of their population is religious, how many believe in god, how many go to church, et cetera, et cetera and then we ask, how are those countries doing? How are they, they doing in all sorts of ways. And it turned out that, that religious countries kind of suck. Way to put it better is research by, by Gregory Paul. In one study he looked by, at 18 democracies. __And he found that the more religious ones are worse in every way you could imagine. Higher rate of murder, higher rate of suicide. They're worse even in ways that that religious people you would expect to be particularly worried about, like sexually transmitted diseases, teen pregnancy, and abortion. Being religious then is bad for a country.__

__Now, one would be very careful about getting your cause and effect right. Even your most ardent attacker of religion probably doesn't believe that somehow being religious gave these countries all of these problems. But rather religion may well be a response to all of these problems. And we saw a little bit about this before with regard to loose societies and tight societies. Where certain properties of tight societies, which may correspond to religion, are responses to various forms of threat, including threats like high crime rate.__

Various books that, that, that have looked at largely atheistic societies, like the Scandinavian countries, like this book, it's this book, Society without God, have found that, that such countries are fairly nice places to be in. The don't tend to kill each other as much, they don't rape each other, they have good values, they, they take care of the, the weak and the poor. And so, it's kind of a paradox.

On the one hand, in the United States, religious people are nicer, at least they're more generous and kinder. But across the world religious societies, include individuals who are less nice to each other. And so we have to figure out someway to explain these two very different facts. So let's before doing that, let's step back. And then ask, how could religion influence your morality?

Keep in mind that religion has different parts. It has belief, it has practices, it has, it, it has experiences. What could have an effect on morality? Well, one answer is belief in God. And, and, and, this goes back to the, without God all things are permitted. Which is that, it could be that a belief in God could make you a nice person, or a nicer person, because you believe somebody's watching you. Now this isn't a crazy view. It, it, its obvious from the lab and probably from the world, that people are obsessed with reputation. They are obsesses with what others think of them. And it's pretty clear that we behave differently when we are observed, then when we aren't. In a test of generosity or fairness and kindness, you typically get different results if someone is anonymously filling out, do, doing some task, versus when a bunch of people are standing around staring at them. In fact, we are so sensitive to reputation that mere symbols that hint, that people are watching you, make you nicer. Even if you know they're just sy-, just symbols.

I'll give you two examples of this. One is, this experiment was done where they get people to do a certain task and there's some way in which they could cheat on the task and the question is how much will they cheat? It's all done on a computer. So half of them get, this is their display and the other half, that's their display. So, it's a display. It's a computer display. There's nobody there. But that display has eyes in it. And when people have a display eyes in it, they cheat less. Here's another study. This was great, this was in England. Bunch of psychologists. This is an example of a creative study. That is sparked by a real-world problem. They had in this department a table would have coffee and sugar and milk. And your supposed to pay for the milk. There's a little money box there, whenever you pour the milk you put in something, it's, it's a pence, I have no idea what English money is, but you put something in, in the box. And they, and, and a psychologist noticed, maybe they were in charge of the box, that people weren't putting in. And they wondered, what could we do that would make people do the right thing and pay for the milk they're using? And so they did something really clever. They right above the area, they had a little spot where they put in a picture. And it alternated, so sometimes they put in a picture of flowers, and sometimes they put in a picture of eyes. And that had the predicted effect. On weeks where there were eyes, there was more money put in a box.

Now again, people say they know, they know their just looking at a picture, they don't think that this is a person. But somehow even the sight of eyes, even the idea of being watched, can trigger good behavior. You could also trigger it in other ways. So, so this would predict that being reminded of God, and that God is watching you, will make you into a better person. 

So this is some work done by by the psychologist's Azim Shariff and Ara Norenzayan. And what they did was a series of studies where they got people to, in one group to unscramble sentences. So this is an example. So, so you, the idea is you should, you have a five word sentence. You have to turn it into a, a four word sentence. You throw one of the words, and it re-scrambles. You say, the dessert was divine. But notice, the sentence contains the word divine, which is a religious word. And the argument here is that in this unobtrusive way, you get people to think about religion. So you get people to scramble a whole bunch of these sentences. You get another group to scramble a whole bunch of different sentences that they don't have these religious words in them, and then you test how nice they are. And in this in this, this procedure, to test how nice they are, they use what's called a, a dictator game. Which is a game in which you you give you get some sum of money, and you decide how much money to give to the other person. And here are the results. So as you'll see, when there was no religious word stuck into the sentences, people weren't very generous. Most people gave nothing, and the average gift was you know, almost two dollars out of, out of ten. __But when people were primed with God concepts, people were far more generous, giving an average of over $4, almost half of the money that they had. And so what you find is that when you prime people, when you make people think about God, they're more generous, and one interpretation, the one Shariff and Norenzayan draw upon, is that the belief in God makes you think about an observing God.__ You feel you're being watched, and that makes you kinder. So this is one way in which religion can make us more moral.

Another aspect is the group aspect of religion, the community, the practice. So all religions have rituals and communities which bring people together, which gives them a common identity, which gives them inter-relations with one another. __And it turns out that this can help explain a lot of what goes on in effects of religion, on morality. They conclude that look, once we know how observant a person is in terms of church attendance, nothing that we can discover about the context of a religious faith adds anything to our understanding or a prediction of a good neighborliness. In fact, they go on to say, the statistics suggest, even an atheist who happened to become involved in the social life in the congregation, perhaps through a spouse, is much more likely to volunteer in, in a soup kitchen than the most fervent believer who prays alone.__ It is religious belongingness that matters for neighborliness, not religious believing. And this had, this, this applies to, something which is plainly morally good, charity. 

But other research finds that community is the key factor for something that is plainly morally bad, like support for suicide attacks. So is in, in, in an interesting study, Jeremy Ginges and his colleagues looked at pep-, at, at, at Israelis and Palestinians. And got your intuitions their approval for suicide attacks on the other side. __And it turns out that the extent of religious belief in Judaism, in Islam, didn't predict anything. What predicted their support for suicide attacks was the extent to which they were regularly involved in a religious congregation. So, so their, their their part of being a religious group, for better or for worse, affected their moral behavior.__ 

And now we're in a position to help solve the paradox that we started with before. Why, why is it so bad, in terms of happiness, in terms of morality, to be an atheist in America? __Well the answer might be that religion gets a lot of its power, its power to, to nurture one’s spirit, its power to motivate kindness, by being part of a community. And it could be any community will do. Not, it, it need not be a religious community.__

In another work Robert Putnam talked about bowling leagues. And how bowling leagues would sort of nurture the spirit and motivate charitable behavior. But in America, the dominant form of community is religious. Outside of the office, this is the dominant way in which people get together. Atheists who are not religious, are excluded from this. And this makes them less happy, and perhaps less kind.

In other countries, you don't have that problem. If you're an atheist in Sweden, you're not all alone. You could be part of your community. In fact, you might even be part of your, part of a church-based community, just not one that has any belief in God. 

__And so, the solution to the paradox might be, being an atheist is morally corrosive in a world in which by virtue of being an Atheist your excluded from the dominant mode of social interaction. If everyone's an atheist or if most people are atheist or even if atheist's have other mechanisms through which to be social, the problem goes away.__

But, you, you might say, I want to end with this, you might think I'm missing the most obvious thing of all. Which is specific religious beliefs. So, religions have holy texts these texts convey laws, they, they contain requirements, they contain moral prohibitions, moral things you are morally obliged to do, certainly this would have an effect, I mean certainly a lot of people's how they, they, they, their moral positions have been manifested to the world. Are often seen by them and by others as a reflection of their religion. As in, well, people who are, say, violently anti-, anti-gay will argue that they're getting this from Leviticus and other parts of the Bible which tell them they should be anti-gay. As a more positive example Martin Luther King's, Jr's final speech was The Mountaintop speech where he talked about the tale of the Good Samaritan, and used the lesson of the tale of the Good Samaritan as a way to talk about the moral obligations we have towards the weakest among us, a, a position which I think event the most secular people on earth could resonate to. 

But in both these cases, the good and the bad, plainly you could see a motivation of religious belief. I mean religions, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, et cetera, et cetera, for instance, have pretty clear cut things to say about charity. About abortion. About homosexuality. And you would imagine then that, that, just common sense that, the, the what your religion says is good or bad will have a powerful influence on your behavior. 

Now this is a common belief, and it makes, common, it makes sense. But there's two reasons to be skeptical, about it. The first is what we mentioned before, and it comes from the Putnam and Campbell study, where it turns out there, as a matter of fact, extent of your religious belief, at least within the population they study, didn't predict anything. I could ask somebody you know, do you believe the Earth was created just a few thousand years ago. Do you think there's a heaven? Do you think there is angels? Bunch of questions. There answers, yes, no, maybe, don't bare any prediction at all to how much they give to charity and what kind of people they are. Just an irrelevant. And, that may be true in general. I mean this is related to the second fact which is something that has been emphasized by Robert Right in his book, The Evolution of God where people often believe and talk as though their moral views are, follow from their religion, but this may largely be an illusion. Modern religions are very complicated and say many different things, and it may be, actually, what happens is you come to a moral view for some other reason, and then, you find within religious texts support for your view. This could be both, sort of views that, that from a secular point of view are positive and view from a secular point of view are repugnant. 

__So Right goes to say, when people see themselves in zero sum relations with other people, that is, see their fortunes as inversely correlated to fortunes of other people, see their dynamic as win/lose, they tend find a scriptural basis for intolerance or belligerence. They goes through the big book and they say, there. They say we should kill our neighbor. But when they see in the relationship that's non zero sum. See their fortunes as positively correlated. See the outcome for a win/win outcome. They're more likely to find a tolerant and understanding side of the scriptures. They're more likely to open the book and say, there, it says love thy neighbor.__

So, what is the psychological effect of religion on morality in individual humans? Well, it's complicated. Religion can plainly influence our morality in many ways for good and for evil. It can do so through community, again, for good and for evil. It can do so through certain sorts of beliefs, including a belief in an all watching God. But it's an open question, surprisingly so, how much specific religious beliefs and practices are the cause of moral changes, which would render them very important. Or whether there are consequence of moral changes, which would render them substantially less important.

## 5 - 1 - 5.1 - Moral Circles - 17_30

This week I want to talk about the moral distinctions that we make between different groups of people. And one way of making sense of these distinctions it's something popularized by the philosopher Peter Singer. __We can talk about them in terms of moral circles. So your moral circle include the class of individuals, the class of entities that you have moral value, that you would want to help.__ Over history, the size of the moral circle has expanded. First, family. Then, all people. Then, sentient beings like animals.

So for one thing, being in a circle or out of a circle, is an all or nothing matter. __So both my family members and far away strangers are in my moral circle, in that I wouldn't want to hurt them. But I give more and more weight to people close to me than those far away. So, there may not be a single circle, but many.__ I'm obliged to not kill most people. But I'm obliged to help only my family & friends.

__Some privileging of yourself over other people is universal. It's acceptable. And in fact to to reject it can be seen as madness.__ We expect to value our lives over others, and that is why we do not donate our organs when we are alive. But there are some limits. There are some cases where altruism, kindness, and sacrifice is expected.

Adam Smith: __Would you sacrifice the lives of thousands in order to save your finger?__ And he concludes, human nature startles with horror at the tought. There's some sacrifices we would be expect to, to be made. There are some things we, we, ways in which we shouldn't privilege ourselves over others. But still, the distinction remains, and the distinction's a strong one.

#### Family

It's not me versus everybody else. It's me and my kin, my close kin, my brothers and sisters, my children, versus everybody else. And this too has a moral pull on us. We see this to some extent acceptable. But just because they're related to me, does that make them more deserving? Is it right to shower my children with resources, private schools, computer games, fancy clothes, while other children go starving? On the other hand, there's a pull in the opposite direction. As the other doctor says, family comes first. And, and there's a sense in which that seems uncontroversial. If I treated my children as, in the same way that I treated strangers, you'd think that I was a monster. We're expected to priviledge our kin over others. 

But, there are limits to this. And, and there are hard problems. Suppose my brother commits a murder and I know he commits a murder. Should I turn him in? If he were a stranger, I'd report him to the police. How far does my obligation to him go? Should I turn him in? Should I perjure myself to protect him from going to prison? Should I kill a witness so that he gets away? Suppose my child needed an organ, a kidney, a, a, a heart in order to live, should I break the law in order to procure this. What if I paid someone to kill a child so my child could live? That seems too much. So there is a certain, our moral intuition say, there is a certain balance here that has to be met.

__That our emotions are so biased to favor ourselves and our family is a Darwinian no-brainer. It follows from how natural selection works. No animal could evolve that didn't care about itself or its kin. It's by doing so that animals survive.__ 

So the third moral circle that we can consider is the group that one belongs to. Good Samaritan story. And, and Christ says, love thy neighbor. And the lawyer shoots back right away. _Who's my neighbor?_ 

Part of the moral of the story is that, that we should blur the distinctions between groups. That, that regardless of what group you come from, you should help other groups. There are many moral circles. Kinship, proximity, accidents of biology, students of Moralities of Everyday Life. You are a member of a group. You could be distinguished from people who don't take this course, who aren't watching these videos. Some groups are more significant than others. This may not be, well be the most significant group of your life. But it is a group nonetheless. And, and we'll talk about how the psychology of being a member of a group has moral consequences.

__Proximity.__ It makes sense to save a girl drowning in front of you, but you are not inclined to save someone drowning in Africa. To put it in more practical terms, at any point, just about any of us has the resources to help people in far away lands. Yet we don't do it. And psychologically, it feels very different. If I let the girl drown, and I walk by, I would feel guilty for the rest of my life. But, I don't give money to charity. If, if I buy some fancy shoes or a fancy computer instead of sending money to charity, I don't really feel guilty at all. If I knew you walked past the girl in the pond, I would consider you a monster. But if I heard you bought yourself some nice shoes, that's just what one would expect

__This distinction carries a lot of intuitive weight, in fact Jeremy Waldren in his discussion of The Good Samaritan story, notes that the story assumes the moral validity of proximity.__ So notice, the story isn't saying you should go around the world and help everybody. You should help all humans. Rather the story puts a lot of emphasis on the fact that as these men went by, they saw the person on the side of the road. And the assumption was, well, when you see them, you're close to them. It's like the girl in the pond, and now you have to act. But if you didn't see that person, you wouldn't have the same moral responsibility. So, these are the sorts of issues we're going to be talking about this week.

In the next three lectures, I'm going to talk about the moral psychology of groups. I'll start off with a very brief lecture talking about the sort of moral questions. About discriminating on the basis of group. And then I will turn to two different ways of thinking of groups. As coalitions and in terms of stereotypes. Then, I want to talk a little bit about, an issue we've been talking about through out this course. How we think about, and how we deal with strangers. What's the rule of proximity? And, here, I want to get into the very interesting issue of research and experimental economics, or behavioral economics. And then, I want to talk a little bit about some developmental work that, it tells us something about how children think about groups. And in the final lecture I want to go back to the original question about expanding the moral circle. Ask yourselves how we can expand the moral circle to include more and more things and then ask yourselves, is it really as simple as that, is this the right thing to do. And those are the questions we want to deal with this week.

## 5 - 2 - 5.2 - The Morality of Group Preference - 6_20

I want to talk about the moral psychology of groups, but before doing so, I want to ask a general question. Which is, how bad is it to make moral distinctions on the basis of the group you belong to? How bad is it to favor your group over another group? Well, in many cases, it's bad indeed. So often when psychologists or philosophers talk about this sort of group thinking, we think about racism, we think about, about the terrible acts committed by people who favor their own race over other races. And it's plainly, at least by, by modern moral lights, and I think accurately, you know, morally atrocious to do so.

But in other cases, it's complicated. So, different groups exert different obligations, different intuitions about how we should proceed. And there's different sorts of obligations that come from one group versus another. So, I'll, I'll sort of explain. We already talked about one case where we think it's okay to make a distinction and that is family. So, if I lend money to my cousin, but I don't lend money to a stranger. That's a form of discrimination but we tend to think of it as a legitimate form, of discrimination. Now what about volitional groups? What about groups that aren't a matter of biology or kin, but groups that we choose to fall in to? 

Well, it, it's well known from the psychology of attraction, psychology of romance and love. That we are attracted to people similar to us. That the, the claim that opposites attract is one of the dumbest sayings ever. It's, there's no evidence for it, opposites hate each other. People similar to one another are attracted to each another. They become friends, they become partners, they, they, they fall in love, and one way in which one could conceptualize sameness is belonging to the same group. And somebody watching this video, or somebody taking this, this course you are a member of a group. And, it would be in some sense, natural, and not necessarily immoral for you to favor other members want to get together with other members of the group feel an affinity towards them. And this doesn't strike us as, as, as ugly in the same sense as making a distincition on the basis of race would. 

Now, then there are domains where it gets quite complicated. so, in many stores around my neighborhood in, in New Haven, I see signs that say, buy local. And I've also heard people to say it's, it's good to buy local, buy from, from people in your community. But of course, this is a, a, of, an example of biasing one group over another. But many people think it's a good kind of bias, so we should feel loyalty towards people we live close to, that we should try to support our neighbors in the literal sense as opposed to people in another city or another country. Often when a President of the United States talks, they'll talk about supporting America over other countries, and many people will say you should buy American. In other nations, they have the same sort of nationalistic bias. All things being equal, somebody from France will favor fellow Frenchmen over people from another nation. Now, how, how much we should be driven by this and whether this is actually the morally right way to think about, to think about the issue is complicated, as I said. 

And there are differences in people's intuitions and these differences map interestingly to the political differences we talked about before. So I'm going to give you an example from, a Republican debate of a few years ago, and a question which came from the audience. And this question, I think, is wrapped up an interesting moral suppositions in a moral world view. >> Get to your question, the question in the hall, on foreign aid. >> Yes ma'am. >> The American people are suffering in our country right now. Why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries, when we need all the help we can get for ourselves. >> Governor Perry, what, what about that? I mean >> Now, there are many different answers that were given to the woman's question. You could, they could argue that, to some extent, foreign aid is actually self-interested. By giving to other countries, they incur debts, the, the Americans get control over what's going on in other countries, it has defense implications, and so on. But the different sort of answer one can say is well other people need it more than we do. And this was not an answer anybody on the stage gave because they accepted this opposition that, that American, that American lives and American welfare in, in some sense is more morally important. At least when it comes to what to do for our own resources than, than lives and welfare in other countries. And this could be an example where I, I could be mistaken, but I doubt you would get the same sort of question and the same sort of response if it was a Democratic political debate. Because Republican and Democratic map more or less onto conservative and liberal and as we've seen in the previous week, conservatives prioritize the group. They prioritize virtue such as patriotism, modern liberals do. This comes from John Hayes analysis of political differences. Um; and I'm going to end on that note, but we're going to return at the very end of uh; this week to the question of what sort of moral distinctions are appropriate to make and, and which one's are not.

## 5 - 3 - 5.3 - What Groups Matter

So let's talk about the psychology of groups. What groups matter? When you see a new person you can put him or her into countless possible categories. What sort of categories do we tend to put people into?

The answer is actually kind of interesting. __There are three categories that jump out when you see a new person. And these are age, sex and race.__ To some extent, this is intuitive. I mean, you could imagine, imagine seeing somebody, and imagine how you register what they look like. But this is actually beyond intuition, being supported by psychological research. And the, and the sort of experiments people use to figure out what categories we take seriously involve memory confusions. So imagine you hear two dozen people, and they each tell you something. And then later on you have to remember who said what. Well, if you do perfect, that doesn't tell you anything. But people don't do perfect. If it's not 25, you can get 100 people. Sooner or later, you start to make mistakes. But what's interesting is the mistakes aren't random. The misattributions aren't random. __And what psychologist's have found, is that the misattributions tend to follow these three categories. So, if you here something from a young white woman, and you get it wrong, you forget who said that, you're more likely to attribute it mistakenly to another young white woman than to an older Hispanic man.__ Your, your, your confusions, getting one person mixed up with some, with somebody else, getting one source of information mixed up with another source of information, will fall along the lines of age, sex and race. 

Even babies readily distinguish the individuals they encounter on those three dimensions. Babies can tell the difference between a baby and an adult or toddler and an adult. Babies very quickly can tell the difference between a man and a woman. And in fact, most babies, babies who are raised by women, prefer women as a category over men. There's some evidence that babies who are raised by a man will later prefer men, over women. But we know they make those categorical distinctions. And babies carve up the world, roughly according to the categories we would use racial categories. __So for instance, in one study done in China, they saw which of these four faces would babies prefer to look at. And the answer was, they would prefer the face on the far left. That is, the Chinese face, over other faces.__ Now, there's a puzzle here. It's not surprising that we naturally carve the world into categories of sex and age. From the standpoint of our evolutionary history, sex and age are always relevant. For most of human history the history of our species, there were profound differences in the activities of males and females. Certainly, from a reproduction standpoint, the male-female distinction is very important. And obviously age matters. It matters whether you're dealing with an old person or a toddler. It matters whether it's someone middle-aged or a teenager. So it's not surprising from an evolutionary point of view, and even from a common sense point of view, that we would take sex and age very seriously. 

But in a very interesting paper Robert Kurz, Kurzban, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides point out that race is the odd-man out here. For most of our evolutionary history we didn't encounter people who looked very different from us. We had no motorized transportation. People didn't go very far. And so, the people you would be surrounded by are people who kind of look like you. So why would we be so prone to break the world into racial categories? Why would race matter so much? And the conclusion that they come to, the hypothesis that they make, is that race is relevant. Is that, age and sex are relevant, in and of themselves. Age matters and sex matters. But race is relevant only as a proxy. What race is a proxy for, in some societies but not others, is socially relevant groups or coalitions. So to spell it out a bit, people growing up and living in a society like the United States will notice that, that, that people with dark skin and people with light skin correspond to two socially relevant divisions. These, these are groups that are often in conflict, that have had a tumultuous history, a history of, of slavery and exploitation that, that, that different all sorts of ways. And so you notice that, that in this society, though maybe not other societies, skin color tells you something about the groups. and, and Kurzban and his colleagues, based on this theory, did a very interesting experiment. They did a memory confusion paradigm of the normal sort. And they found that normally people will, will make mistakes based on race. So, if you have, you know, black individuals and white individuals, and a black individual says something and you get it wrong. You're more likely to attribute it to another black individual than a white individual. Standard finding. 

But then they did something clever. They put these characters in basketball jerseys. Different basketball jerseys, representing different basketball teams. And now what they find is, the race effect largely, not entirely, but largely goes away. Now you start making misattributions based on team. And the way they interpret this data is, you've successfully replaced one coalition with another. If you're a Red Sox fan, the difference between the Red Sox and the Yankees matters hugely. The difference between a black Red Sox player, and a white Red Sox player, not so much. One coalition could swamp the other. Now, this coalitional view, makes some interesting predictions, about the minds of babies and children. 

So, the prediction it makes in particular is that, although babies and children can distinguish between different races, it shouldn't matter to them. They should only take race seriously later on in development in some societies and not others when they're aware that race skin color is a proxy for coalition. __And in fact Catherine Kinsler and her colleagues, did several quite elegant experiments that find exactly that. So you take a toddler, and you have two people offer the toddler a toy. And the question is, who will the kid take it from? And one person is black and the other one's white. And say the toddler in this study is white. What's the answer? Well, the answer is, they're 50-50. Although they can distinguish between different races and they know, and they might even prefer to look at their own race than another race. They don't care. It doesn't matter to them. It's only later in development, depending on the society, depending on, on, on the situation age four, age five, age six. It's later in development that race starts to matter.__ But initially, race doesn't seem to matter, to the kids. 

What does matter? Well, from a coalitional point of view. One reasonable question is, what's the cue that, that has always been a signal that you're dealing with a member of a different group? The answer is not skin color. __The answer, actually, is language. So, societies, different cultures within the same geographical area, they might all look alike. But if there's any separation at all, they might talk a little bit differently. And so, you could imagine that humans are pre-wired to take differences in language as deeply significant.__ And in fact, if you do the same such experiment that I described before. But now, forget about color, what happens is one of these people is speaking English and the other one is speaking French. Who do the kids, the American kids, take the toy from? And the answer is, they take it from the person speaking English. What if one of these characters is speaking English? And the other one is speaking English but with a little bit of an accent. Again, the toddlers will prefer the speaker without the accent. They're very carefully making discrimination's then, on the basis of what social group you fall into. And before they're ever sensitive to the role of a fact consideration like race, they're glomming onto how people talk. 

Now, there's many other ways that you could break up the world into different coalitions. Language is just one of them. But, one lesson from social psychology, is that humans, at least human adults. But, in some experiments kids, even young kids, are extremely prone to break up in the world into us versus them. And in order to get people to break up the world into us versus them, you don't need very much. So, some of the original studies were done by the, the social psychologist Aree Toshfel. And what Toshfel did in one of his classic studies is, he got people to rank different abstract paintings. And then regardless of the rankings that they, that they gave. That was just a way to sort of get them to think something was going on. Regardless of the rankings that they gave, he said to half of them, you're a Klee lover. You love the paintings of Klee. And the other half, he told, you're a Kandinsky lover. You love the paintings of Kandinsky. Then he offer these individuals some money to distribute. Either to their own, members of their own group, not themselves, but members of their own group, or members of other groups, the other group. __And what he found was, that Klee lovers would say, I want give the money to other Klee lovers. And I don't want the Kandinsky lovers to have quite so much. And the Kandinsky lovers would say the same thing. Even on the sort of most arbitrary of distinctions, people take it seriously.__ Other studies have found that you could break up people into two different groups and get people to favor their own group. Literally on the basis of a flip of a coin. So, you flip the coin, you're in a heads group, you're in a tails group. Then you ask people how they want their resources distributed, it turns out, even then, they want to favor their own group over another group. The similar experiments have been done with children. Some of this work has been done by Melanie Killen and her colleagues. Where you get some kids to either wear blue t-shirts, or red t-shirts. You make it clear, this is sort of an arbitrary division. But very quickly, the blue t-shirts kids would hang out with other blue t-shirt kids. The red t-shirt kids with other red t-shirt kids. And each group thinks the other group is in some way inferior. And each group thinks their own group is in some way better and supports their own group. In this way that group thinking connects deeply to our, the psychology of coalitions. The psychology of teams, of warring teams that are competing. And in the process of this, group thinking involves favoritism towards your own group. And some sort of negativity, even dehumanization of the other group. And this is a theme we're going to develop in the next lecture.

## 5 - 4 - 5.4 - Stereotypes - 23_07

So let's continue to explore the psychology and morality of group thinking. And, and, and I want to look at it just for a bit in a bit of a different way. and, and talk about something much more general, which is categorization. So this is straight out of intro psych, psychology 101. This is the basic fact about human reasoning, which is that we don't just think about the world in terms of individual things rather humans, and, and every other creature, makes generalizations. We, we categorize objects as falling into a category or class, and then based on this, we make generalizations about the properties of that object. 

And it's because tat we do this, that we could respond adaptively to novel individuals. And so it's essential for survival. So you might not have seen any of those things before in your life, any of those particular things. But but you recognize what they are. You recognize that they are a chair, an apple, and a dog. And because you do so you could generalize facts about them. You could say, you could probably sit on the chair, you could probably eat the apple. The dog will bark and run around and it's alive. Now, there's always exceptions these sort of statistical generalities. The chair might be very fragile and if you sat on it, you might collapse. The apple might be poisonous. The dog might have vocal damage and not be able to bark. But for the most part these generalizations are, are reasonable. I know this is a cup. Even if I've never seen this before, I'd recognize it as a cup, and I could assume I could lift it, and it could hold a liquid. I see this liquid looks like water, and I could drink it, and it will nourish me. And if I couldn't do any of those things, I would be dead. Because I'd be unable to know what do with food or objects or anything. 

We constantly deal with unfamiliar entities, and we constantly have to use statistical information about the categories that they fall into, to make generalizations about what they, those things are, and how they work. It gets interesting though, when we realize that some of these categories we put things into, are human categories. Some of the things are people, and some of the categories are categories of people. And sometimes we call, statistical knowledge, a statistical pattern of generalizations of human category, a stereotype. So you can identify people as Americans, teenagers, blacks, Asians et cetera, et cetera, and for each of these categories you can make some statistical inferences about them. If you know somebody's a lawyer, for instance, you could guess that they probably went to college. If you know somebody's a Red Sox fan, you could guess they would have been very happy at their events of, at the World Series a few days ago. If somebody is a student of moralities of everyday life, they probably have access to a computer. 

Now all of these generalizations could be in interesting ways wrong. There're always exceptions, but they're good generalizations for the most part. They're statistically robust. And in general, one can defend stereotypes. So for one thing stereotypes are sometimes positive. Just about every group has some facts about it that distinguish it from other groups and that are good, and maybe more to the point, stereotypes tend to be accurate. So Lee [INAUDIBLE] and his colleagues did several studies where they ask people about ethnic stereotypes and gender stereotypes, and they found reviewing all of the data, that people are actually, has a pretty, have a pretty good sense of true facts about these groups. You could ask them which group has more a, more of a proportion of its members in prison? Which group is more likely to be employed as lawyers? You can see some of the questions are easy. Who is more likely to be a rapist, a man or a woman? Well, there are female rapists. But the odds say it's a man. And, and, and if you were a police officer and, and you know there was sudden call that there was a sexual assault somewhere. And you're driving in the street looking for suspects. You'd be a rational, statistical creature to look for men over women. For the most part, we're smart, statistical beings. The same cognitive systems that allow us to understand that this can hold a liquid, also allow us to appreciate certain generalizations that'll hold within and across human groups. 

So that's the case for stereotypes but there's also arguments against stereotypes. So some of the arguments against stereotypes rely on the fact that they are not always accurate and there's different ways a stereotype can turn out to be inaccurate. One is, you have bad information, a sort of garbage in, garbage out system. So, if my stereotype is developed through sort of random encounters of representative members of the category, then I'm pretty likely to get a good sense of what the category members have in common. __But if my stereotype is created through the media or atypical instances it might distort my sense of things. when, the, the HBO series the Sopranos was on TV. Some Italian American groups complained that it was giving people the wrong impression of Italian-Americans. If you live in a place where you don't know any Italian-Americans, and the only Italian-Americans you have access to is by switching on HBO and seeing Tony Soprano and his family, you're going to get a pretty bad impression of them.__ Similarly, if all your impressions of people who live in New Jersey comes from television programs Jersey Shore, where, if you haven't seen it you can skip it, but it's full of you know, promiscuous, badly behaving people. It will give you a bad impression of New Jersey. If, if it's not just a modern problem. If the only encounter you have with Jews is Shakespeare's Shylock, that will distort your stereotype in a particulary negative way. So media presentations can distort the stereotype. 

The stereotype could also be distorted by coalitional thought, by in-group out-group thinking. So attitudes, for instance, about Russians changed radically, during the period immediately after World War II when they went from being allies to enemies. It isn't that your experience of individual Russians changed, Americans had no experience of individual Russians, but rather the fact that they were no longer on our side but on the opposite side skewed how people thought about them. And as we have seen before, you can get that sort of skewing even on the basis of a flip of a coin. So, as a way to reinforce this there are something I said before which wasn't exactly correct. __I said before that stereotypes tended to be accurate and this is true for ethnic groups, for, for, for gender, for occupation but there's one domain where they're not accurate and that is for political parties. In particular, people from one political party tend to have mistaken stereotypes about members of the other political party and I think there's a reason behind this. I think the reason behind this is the political parties are heavily coalitional and when somebody is kind of in your head as your enemy, as, as your out group, the opposite side, you'll think worse of them.__ And this, this tendency to think worse of them, will corrode your stereotype and make it inaccurate. So one part, problem with stereotypes is, although for the most part they're accurate, sometimes they aren't. There are factors that some interesting circumstances could distort how accurate your stereotype is. 

Then there's problems of the harm that stereotypes do, and this comes in different flavors. So one source of harm is sometimes known as stereotype threat. And this is an idea developed by Claude Steele and his colleagues. And what stereotype threat is, is that if there is a negative stereotype of your group in a certain domain, being reminded of that stereotype, being exposed to the fact that you're a member of that group, could affect your performance in that domain. And there are some powerful demonstrations of this. So, for instance, imagine a math test. And this is one math test where, where you have, you put your name, and you have a ques-, a series of math questions. __What Steele and his colleagues find is that African-American people taking the test will do worse if they're asked, before doing their test, about their race. Being and, and, and white people will not show this effect. And their argument is that it is a negative stereotype regarding blacks in academic ability. And reminding people about this negative stereotype about themselves, right before they do a test would make them behave worse. You also get the same effect for women.__ So, being reminded about, about the fact that you're a woman right before you do a Math test, given that there's a stereotype that women do somewhat worst in Math lowers your score if you've been exposed to the stereotype. __In one interesting study experimenters tested Asian women and they found that if you remind these women about their race, they actually do a little bit better. Because there's a positive stereotype about Asians in math that kind of accelerates their performance.__ If you remind them of their sex, they do worse, because there's a negative stereotype about women and math. So stereotypes can have these, sort of, negative effects on people. 

Putting aside how accurate they are as statistical summaries, being exposed as stereotypes often has a pernicious effect. Finally, there're some problems regarding more general problems regarding the application of stereotypes. So, there're some cases where we simply believe that stereotypes shouldn't be applied. In some cases, because they aren't accurate. But, in other cases, even if they are accurate, it's wrong to apply them. So, there's a lot of debate, going on, interesting moral debate over the morality of racial profiling. Where many people argue that even if the, the stereotypes are accurate enough to increase your chances of catching criminals or terrorists or what have you. Still the societal and personal cost of discriminating against people on the basis of race is too high. The cost outweighs the benefit. You could think of this in utilitarian terms where the cost is in terms of displeasure the cost is in terms of the pain of the people being discriminated against. Or you could think of it in Kantian terms that there are some sort of general violation of some principal of human dignity and fairness, but regardless there's at least some cases where some people believe that it is wrong to apply stereotypes regardless of the accuracy, and then what you might want to do is you might choose not to rely on them. But here's the problem. __The problem is, that there's a lot of evidence, that even when we don't want to rely on stereotypes, even when we consciously believe that we are not bias, none the less, we are influenced by them and fall back upon them.__ In an interesting way, we are at war with ourselves. 

And so a lot of the literature here distinguishes your explicit beliefs about race about what's the right thing to do from you implicit beliefs, which are often your unconscious beliefs that influence you whether you like it or not. So for instance this graph is, is, is, is people's responses to the question of whether they would vote for, another wise qualified African-American to be, to be president. And what you could see is there's a profound difference across time and what you also see is when you get to modern times, when you get to, to, to 20 years ago, or 50 years ago, people were like 100%. __Very few people explicitly will say, I would not vote for somebody, just because they're black. And maybe some of them are lying, but for the most part there's a lot of evidence that they are sincerely expressing their views. This is really how they think. They would not dream of letting race be a factor in who they vote for. At the same time though, there's a lot of evidence that people are swayed by implicit, and unconscious biases against certain groups including certain racial groups.__ 

And a lot of this is is been tapped by various psychological methods including something called an implicit attitudes test, which was developed by Mahzarin Banaji, who used to be a colleague of mine, and Tony Greenwald, and you could take it online at this, at, at this web site. You could, you could do this, you could test yourself on your implicit biases. And the way this test work, the way the test works is you, you, you get people to, to respond to certain pairs of events, and you can test by the speed of their response which pairs are natural and which pairs are unnatural. So imagine in one condition there's two buttons. And you're told press this button if either a white face shows up on a screen or a positive word like happy or fun. And this button if a black face shows up on a screen or a negative word like disaster or misery. And so you get people to do that and see how fast they do it. In other condition, you say, okay. Press this button, if a white face shows up on the screen or a negative word. And this button if a black face shows up on the screen and a positive work. Now, it turns out that these situations are not identical in people speed. Because people tend to have a bias that white is positve and black is negaitve, it's more natural to press a single button, for the white positive, black negative then the other way around. And this shows up in the mistakes people make and it shows up in reaction time. And there's IATs not just for race, but for all sorts of other things like sexual orientation, and and, and gender, and obesity, and age. __One of the strongest biases they've ever found is elderly negative, young positive. So even people that explicitly say, I have no bias against elderly people still on IAT, people, even elderly people, find it much quicker to associate elderly people with negative than elderly people with positive.__ 

And then there's a host of other psychological findings. So one, one I think very interesting finding, involves showing people pictures of the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and American President Barack Obama, and seeing which of these pictures they associate with American. Now, if you just ask people, they laugh and they say, well Obama's American, Blair is not. But if you test people unconscious bias they are often quicker to associate Blair with being American and Obama, because Blair has light skin and Obama has dark skin and so Obama is more likely to be seen as an American. 

Now, on the face of all these implicit tests and you could that there is, there's dozens of different experiments, there's hundreds of different, of different, research reports using these different methods. One response is, who cares? So we're talking about all these studies involve pressing buttons for a fraction of a second, different, different things like that. What difference does that make in the real world? Why should we even pay any attention to these implicit biases? Well, we should pay attention because they make a difference in every day life. So, how quickly you respond, for instance, makes a big difference if you're a police officer. __There's now several studies finding that both non officers, but also police officers, are quicker to shoot, are quicker to shoot a black person holding an undetermined object, than a white person. To put it differently they're more likely to mistake a, when a, when a black person's holding something that's not a gun, they are more likely to mistake it for a gun, than if a white person is holding something that's not a gun.__ And here stereotypes affect you in a fraction of a second. 

There's also emergency intervention. So, so one study sees how likely you are to rescue somebody. And these subjects tend to be egalitarian people who are not explicitly racist. If they're the only person around and there's a black person yelling for help or a white person yelling for help, in both cases, they're pretty likely to intervene. But if they are with other people and they feel a bit less pressured to be, to intervene because of what psychologists call a bystander effect, which is if you're surrounded by people, you're less likely to act. There race plays a big role. __They're much more likely to help the white victim over the black victim.__

Or take, as another example, how people respond when they have to judge resumes, CVs. They get CVs, they get resumes of, of job applicants and they have to judge them. And the only difference between the applications is information given as to whether the applicant is white or the applicant is black. And you see the data here, so the study was first done in 1989. And what you could see is the, the, the, the darker green bars represent the black applicants, __when the resume is strong, it says this person is, is great, you're actually very highly likely to recommend them for a job regardless of their color. But when a resume is so-so, it's a bit unclear, people are, are significantly more likely to rec, to, to rec, recommend and rank as better the white applicant than the black applicant.__ The same study was replicated in 1999 and was replicated again in 2005. Again, it's not that people read a resume, and they see it's, it's a black person, and then they rub their hands together and say, now I'm going to be racist. They don't know they are being racist. But rather, their stereotypes kick in, and then their subtle judgements are influenced. 

One final example of, of a study that that just came out very recently this was done by Mahzarin Banaji and her colleagues it's a very clever and simple study. It was done on eBay an auction site where you go online and you bid for different things. And this is bidding for baseball cards. And, so they did an experiment, it's always the same baseball cards. But these, when you post something online to, for people to bid on, you include pictures. So half the people saw this set of pictures, half the people saw that set of pictures. The only difference, the difference wasn't the cards, wasn't anything else. __The difference was the color of the hands and it turns out people bid considerably less when the same baseball cards are held by black hands than by white hands.__ Again, I would imagine very few of these people would know that this is what they're doing. Very few of these people would acknowledge say, you know, this is, I, I have a racial bias here. It's an unconscious thing. But it does play a role. 

So, how do we respond this? Suppose, suppose we're in a domain, where, we explicitly think that that we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of gender or a race or age or anything else. But nonetheless we find ourselves with implicit biases driving us the other way, driving us to discriminate. It turns out this is not an unsolvable problem, you don't get anywhere by trying very hard. So, it's a mistake to think that, wow, I know unconsciously I may be biased towards race or gender or age, so I'm just going to try very hard not to biased. This is alarmingly unsuccessful. We are not good at shutting down these biases. But we are very smart creatures. And here, as in other domains and morality we're, we're smart enough to to ar-, to engineer the environment such that our racial biases or gender biases or other biases, don't get a chance to operate. And there's different ways to do so, corresponding the different, sort of, political and moral views. You may have quotas. You may say, you know, regardless of what you want to, you want to do consciously you're going to decide ahead of time to have 20% this group, 30% that group, 50% that group. Or you may decided to, to, to make your judgments race and gender blind. Where any biases you have won't have a chance to operate. __Now notice that doing it blind, and doing it based on quotas, are two opposite solutions to the same problem. One involves entirely obliterating any information about race, another involves explicitly incorporating race into, into decisions, as well with gender and age and so on.__ But although they're opposite solutions they both rely on the same premise, which is that one can engineer the situation to get rid of the biases we don't want to have. And I think this is how morality works in general. I think when we're faced with what we believe to be a moral shortcoming in ourselves and others, we don't solve the problem by just sort of trying very hard. Rather, we often solve the problem by being smart enough to engineer the world so that our worst impulses get staunched and our better impulses get a chance to be expressed.

## 5 - 5 - 5.5 - Economic Games - 10_51

We've discussed people's attitudes toward strangers a lot throughout this course. And, it's an interesting topic, because there, there, there's a tension between two class of facts about how we deal with strangers. There's a positive and there's a negative. __So positively, we're often kind to strangers. People give to charity, we leave tips in restaurants, we'll help somebody in trouble. But we're also often not kind to strangers. There's patterns of indifference to human suffering, which are kind of striking.__ And so it becomes a very interesting question to ask, what's our natural default response to somebody we don't know. And, and, you know, to what extent is the division between people we know and people we don't know, people who are close to us and people we are far away? To what extent is that a rigid difference, that, that powerfully influences our moral thought? 

And we, we've talked about this in different ways. But one sort of field of inquiry that could you give you some real insights comes from, behavioral economics. And in particular, it comes from sort of so-called economic games, where you bring people into a lab and you give them some sum of money, and you see how they, what they do with it under certain circumstances. And many people have argued that the responses in these economic games tell us a lot about human nature. And it tells a lot about our generosity, our self-interest, our spite, our altruism. So I want to talk about two, the two most famous economic games and tell you in this lecture, some of the main findings that have come out from the study of these games. And in the next lecture, I'm going to continue it, but a little but more critically. 

It turns out though, that people offer about half, about $5 out of the $10. Why would they do this? Well, here's one answer. You're person A and you're trying to imagine what it's like to be person B and something occurs to you. It occurs to you that B might not be entirely self-interested and rational. Maybe B won't, doesn't want to accept an unfair distribution. Something as paltry as $1. Maybe B will expect you to give him or her about half, and so if you give him or her less, they'll reject it. And if you know that other person's going to reject the small offer, you have to offer five. If you just offer one, you'll walk home with nothing. If you offer two, you'll walk home with nothing, but if you offer $4 or $5, they'll accept it. You get to to keep your money. They get to keep their money. 

Now, it turns out the idea that people get upset at being offered low amounts of money is correct. And this is reflected in many ways. __There are FMRI neuro-imaging studies that find that the brain activation when people get low offers is consistent with being upset, is consistent with spite. There are facial expression studies finding that when people get low-ball offers, their faces contort into a look of contempt or disgust, the face on the far left there.__ And finally, that's when people will tell you. If you, in one study they had a situation where the receiver not only got to accept or reject the money, but also got to send a message to the person who proposed the money. And when people got low offers they would send certain messages. So one message was, should not have been greedy, oh well, you make nothing. Now notice the person, B, B doesn't make anything either, B threw away money, but had the satisfaction of making sure A didn't get any money either. Dude, that's kind of greedy. We should have divided the money equally. Thanks for nothing. And my favorite, you suck. 

__So people don't like getting low-ball offers.__ And, in response when if, if you want to walk away with some money and you're person A, you have to offer a significant amount of money. And this is actually a really interesting fact about human interaction, which is that in certain cases it's useful to be irrational, or at least to be seen as irrational. __The problem is a rational person is easily exploited, because you know if you do something bad to them, they will always give a measured and proportionate response.__ You see a rational person and they're eating dessert. You take away their dessert. And they say, why did you take away my dessert? And you say well, I know you're not going to get in a big fight over this. I know you're not going to get too upset. That would be unreasonable. So I'm going to take your dessert whenever I want to. Its just a dessert, it won't bother you. It isn't worth it for you, so I get to do whatever I want to you, as long as your response doesn't get too, too violent. But it won't be violent if I just steal your dessert, so I'll steal your dessert. Imagine a different kind of person. You walk up to them, you know, you reach for their dessert, and they say, if you steal my dessert, I will kill you, then I'll kill your whole family, then I'll kill myself. It's unreasonable. But, you're not going to take that person's dessert. __There's an advantage, perversely, in being known as a person who will behave irrationally. Because the, the, the possibility of irrational retaliation forces them to be nicer to you than they otherwise would.__ 

And this is nowhere near as, nowhere clearer than the Ultimatum Game. If you were playing with a rational computer, you'd always give a dollar, because a dollar's been nothing. They would take it. They get nothing out of punishing you. But because they're irrational, you have to give them more. Now, I think the Ultimatum Game tells you a lot of interesting things about strategies and social situations and about how people reason about the minds of other people. But it doesn't tell you anything about generosity or fairness. Because the generous gifts in the Ultimatum Game may not be generosity at all, it might just be, well I want to take home some money and I know I might be dealing with a spiteful person so, I have to offer a lot. 

But there's another game that, that avoids this problem. And it's incredibly simple. It's called the Dictator Game. And a Dictator Game is that A has $10, A can give B any amount that they want, from nothing to all of it, and that's it. It's not even a game at all. It's a single choice, a single individual makes. Now, if you're greedy, you just take the $10 and walk away. But interestingly, people don't do that. Even though there's no chance of retaliation, what you do is final. __Even though the person you're interacting with can't, will never know it's you, can't reward you or punish you in the future people give about 20% to 30%, about $2 to $3, and that's really interesting.__ Why? Why don't people just walk away? Well, many economists, and then psychologists and anthropologists and evolutionary biologists have taken these findings, particularly the findings from the Dictator Game, as suggesting that we're naturally generous, we're naturally egalitarian. And so there's a lot of research that, looking at how could this egalitarian attitude have evolved? Why are we so naturally kind to strangers? What benefit could this suppose? And this is one way to interpret the results from these economic games. In the next lecture though, I want to present a very different, much more cynical view.

## 5 - 6 - 5.6 - Criticisms of Economic Games - 11_55

So, the story we were left with at the end of last lecture is that his economic gains will reflect his natural kindness and a part of people. He's natural. Egalitarian motives, since we were chosen at random, it's just the flip of a coin that I'm A and not B, I should share the wealth. I should, I should sort of just pass around some of it to the next person. Now, this is a very nice interpretation of the data, but many people are a lot more cynical. There's something which seems strange about this response. If I'm walking down the street, And I find a, you know, I don't know, 10, 20 dollar bills on the sidewalk, I don't immediately look around for someone to hand half of it to, even though it was just an accident I found it instead of the next person. 

__So why do people behave so generously in these economic games? Well, there's 2 sort of cynical, alternatives. 1, is that it's not so much that the people want to be good, it's more that people want to look good.__ So, in all of these experiments, people are typically acting and then experimenting sort of writing down a recording. What they're doing. And it might be that when people are being kind and generous, they're, they're doing so because they don't want to look like a bad person in front of the experimenter. Now some of these experiments are done anonymously, but even then people have a good sense that what they're doing is being monitored. And often even when they're told it's anonymous, it really isn't. Their behavior is being monitored. And they find it awkward to do something bad in front of an audience. And we've seen this before. When we discussed the psychology of religion and its moral effects, we talked about experiments showing that when people are being observed, they're nicer than, than when than when they're not observed. So people are more likely to cheat when shown a computer screen like this. Then a computer screen like that, which gives them the impression that somebody is watching them. There was this lovely study where, where psychologists looked at the extent of what people would pay for the milk that they would use and had two sorts of posters up, either flowers or eyes, and found out people were much more likely to pay. When there were eyes on the poster as opposed to flowers. So we, we could see that maybe the observation, people behave nicely in order to preserve your reputation, in order not to look like jerks. One economist points out that, imagine doing the dictator game. And now you're on national TV. Your parents are watching. All your friends are watching. And you're probably going to get 50% because you want to show the world what a nice person you are. So, plainly, reputation has some effect. 

There's now experiments suggesting that reputation may have a big effect and I'll tell you about 2 studies, which I like very much. 1 is by uh; Dana and his colleagues. So Dana and his colleagues are saying very clever, they explain to their subjects what a dictator game was, and then they gave then a choice. __Either, we'll give you 10 dollars and you'll play a dictator game with somebody in the other room, or we'll give you just $9 and you can just walk away and keep the $9. And what they found was many of their subjects took the $9.__ Try to think for a moment what you would do. So there is certain sense in which taking the $9 is crazy. Because suppose you are greedy. Well, if you are really greedy and all you care about is yourself, you should just take the $10 and walk away. In the dictator game. Why, why settle for a dollar less? Suppose you're generous. Well if you're generous you should certainly play the dictator game, and give away some of the money to the other person. So why would people take the $9 and leave? Well, what Dana and colleagues suggest is They wanted to get a lot of money out of the situation but they didn't want to have to feel pressured to give, and there's a nice analogy to this. There's a beggar on the street, and he has a cup out for money, and I could, and, and one option is I could walk past him and give him some money. And another option is, I could walk past them, and not give them some money. But a 3rd option is, I could cross the street, so I don't have to walk past them. I could cross the street so I'm not confronted with the option of having to be kind. And I think this is why sometimes people take the $9. 

Another study was done by List and his colleagues. And this is a modified dictator game, so there's Person A and there's Person B. And Person A is told okay you're going to get $10, here's $10 for you. And the other person who's in an another room, you're not going to see him is going to get $5. And the question is, how much of your $10 do you want to give away? Under no circumstances, people give about $2. They start to give some small sum of money. And that's, and, and, and [INAUDIBLE] look, look, people are being generous. But then, they did a clever twist on this. They had exactly the same scenario, but now they told the person, okay you have $10, other person's $5 You could give that other person as much money as you want, or you can take as much money as you want from the other person. Now, if the giving is just motivated by generosity, this other option shouldn't make any difference. Because, you know, why would I ever want to take from this person? But it does make a difference. __When given the option of taking, all of a sudden, people start taking away a little bit from the other person.__ 

So how do we think about this? Well, their interpretation goes like this. Suppose you let the standard game, you get $10, another person $5. __You're told to give as much as you want to the other person. And what you think is you know, I want to walk away with as much money as possible. But I don't want to look like an ass, so I'll give him some money. In a second circumstance you have $10 you could either give, you could take. You say, look I want to walk away with as much money as possible and I don't want to look like an ass. What an ass would do is take all of his money. I am not going to do that. I will just take a little of it.__ There is no generosity here. It's basically reputation management and the idea is that that our behavior is not so much governed by a sense of right and wrong, as a sense of wanting to appear right or wrong in front of an imagined or real spectator. 

So that's 1 sort of objection to the standard interpretation of these economic games. A 2nd one is that regardless of why people give in the dictator game, whether its due to generosity or its due to reputation management, this may not be universal. It may be cultural. So, in a classic article published just, just a couple years ago by Joseph Henrich and his colleagues, they talk about what they describe as the weirdest people in the world. And weird is an acronym, meaning Western Educated Industrial Rich Democracies. And they point out most psychology research is done with weird people. Roughly 96% of the subjects of psychology experiments are from western educated, industrial rich democracies, in fact 68% of the subjects are from America. Roughly 99% of the authors Of psychology experiments are from weird societies, and about 3 quarters are from the United States. But only 12% of modern humans come from weird societies. So almost all of our edifice of psychology, both this, the people we study and the people who do the studying, are from a very narrow subset Of humanity. More than that, this narrow subset is unusual in certain significant regards. So, where people differ in their lifestyle than the way humans have lived, and the conditions under which we've evolved Through almost all of human history. For a vast majority of our evolutionary history, we've lived small scale societies that have no schools, governments, hospitals, police, complex divisions of labor, market's, militaries, former laws or mechanized transport. These are all pointed out by Hen Ricadall in her article. They point out that that, that children had no books. And no TV, they had no internet. They learn, they didn't go away to go to school. They learned through observation and imitation by around age 10 they were expected to be able to gather there own food. And routinly kill and butcher animals. This isn't the life that weird people live including me, is entirely different from that. And a life that weird children live in, including my children and including the children that I study in my lab is entirely different from that. 

Hen Ricadall suggests that this difference might make a difference. They suggest that data we collect on weird societies including data about moral intuitions, including data about generosity, and economic gains may not reflect the natural human state. But rather may reflect a very unusual sort of cultural and then they do studies that might support this. __So, if you look at United States' behavior in the dictator game, in 1 study people in the United States give just under 50% of their resources. They give a huge, just about half of their money, to a stranger. But then you look at other societies and it turns out you get a huge amount of variation. And in fact the US case, which is, may be taken as prototypical, or, or, or sort of average, isn't average at all. It's extremely generous. And when you look at, at small scale societies that are less weird, you find considerably less generosity towards strangers.__ Now this point, that societies that are not weird, societies that where, where people live closer to the way in which we, we existed for most of evolutionary history shows up also in reports of, of, of ethnographers and anthropologists. So Jared Diamond for instance talks about the lifestyle of people in Papua New Guinea. And he writes, to venture out of one's territory to meet other humans, even if they lived only a few miles away, was equivalent to suicide. And Margaret Mead writes, most primitive tribes feel that if you run across one of these subhumans from a rival group in the forest, the most appropriate thing to do is bludgeon him to death. Now I grant that we are different, I grant that people in this society and people in, in non weird, sorry in weird society more generally, do help strangers, do give do give resources to strangers We interact with strangers regularly. I, I will land in a strange airport, and I will be alone and I will be surrounded by people I don't know. And, and I will not, they will not attack me. I don't believe they'll attack me, I do not hate them. But what the data suggests is that this kindness to strangers is neither robust nor universal. It's fragile, and it's a cultural innovation, deeply connected to concerns about reputation and not something that comes naturally to us.

## 5 - 7 - 5.7 - How Do We Naturally Respond to Strangers

So we, we know that children respond often very poorly to strangers, they get very anxious next to strangers, they panic psychologists call it stranger anxiety, but we also know that when we are old enough to participate in these economic games they behave quite differently from adults in the same society. __So adults, you'll remember, when given the dictator game, are quite generous, giving 20, 30, 40, sometimes 50%. Kids don't. There are now dozens of studies where you test children at different ages, and what we find is that that they give a lot less. Kids start off quite stingy and self interested.__ And they, they become more and more amenable to sharing their resources as they get older. So in some way they're selfish. 

I actually think that there's some evidence that they're even worse than selfish. And I'll illustrate this by, by telling you an experiment I did with Mark Sheskin who's now a, a post-doc in France and Karen Wynn my, my colleague and my collaborator here at Yale. What we did was, we played a certain economic game, with young children. And the way this game was played was children get to choose, which of two distributions they want. They could choose the distribution the green distribution, which is, some of the poker chips to them, and some to a stranger. And, or the blue distribution, a different number of poker chips to them, and a different number to the stranger. And the poker chips, they were told, could be traded in later for toys. So they knew they, that they were valuable. And they were told a stranger was another child, who was going to come into the lab later that day, they would never see this child. So it's anonymous in the same way that the economic games are anonymous. So we could use this method to do, explore various contrasts. One contrast is (1,1) versus (2,2). What that means is, the (1,1) is one for the child, and one for the other, person, versus two for the child, and two for the other, person. Now, if children are greedy, they should chose (2,2), because they get two instead of one.  __But children from at the age between four and seven, go for (1,1) and (1,0). And this show's that they're not just selfish, they're worse than that, they're willing to give up a resource. So as not to get relatively less than a stranger. And or to, to, in a, to be in a situation where they get relatively more than a stranger.__ 

I was presenting this to to a Hillel group, a Jewish group on campus and somebody came up to me later and told me that this is reminiscent of a Jewish folktale where an angel comes down from heaven and meets a very envious man. And the angel says to the envious man, I will give you anything you want. But your neighbor will get double. And the envious man thinks for a minute and says, I want you to pluck out one my eyes. I told a story of my lab group and one of my graduate student says, said you know there is an Irish folk tale that's exactly the same way except the punch line is I want you to beat me after death. And I think this tells us something about human nature. I think there's some truth although, I've been talking about the moral powers of children and our innate moral sense. I think there's some virtue in what Kingsley Amis, the author Kingsley Amis, once said which is, it's now wonder that people are so horrible when they start their life as children.

## 5 - 8 - 5.8 - The Problem of Kindness - 10_23

I ended the last lecture on a rather grim note, focusing on our, our natural antipathy, our indifference to strangers. But I want to, I want to sort of point out that it's, some societies do encourage and nurture kindness to strangers. It might be tied up with reputation, but still, you know, the fact is that, that, that we are nice in different ways to people we don't know. And so the question comes up, wh, what happens in some places and some times to nurture this kindness. I think there's different answers. 

So one answer is proposed by Robert Wright in a serious of of books and articles, including Non Zero, where he argues that the expansion of our moral sentiments to strangers is actually motivated by a form of enlightened self-interest. An idea is that as we become more capitalistic, more engaged in trade and market economies we become more interdependent with other people. All of a sudden your fate matters to me because I buy stuff from you or I sell stuff to you. I no longer want you dead. I'm no longer indifferent actually. I want you to be healthy enough and happy enough to engage in commerce with me. Now, this has always struck me as an interesting hypothesis, but recently there has been some nice evidence for it.

So, the same group that studied the weird societies did a series of studies looking at how people from non-weird societies, that is most of humanity play these economic games. And what they did was, they graphed the societies based on the extent to which they were involved in market economies. And one way to phrase this is the percentage of calories you get. you, you purchase. So in some place, some places, people don't purchase their own calories at all. They make their own food. me, I purchase like 99% of their, of my calories. My wife makes tomatoes in the backyard, I eat them, that's 1%. And then the question is, what's the relationship between how enmeshed society is with markets and money. And, how kind they are to strangers? 

And you might assume, I mean you might assume oh, markets are bad, capitalism is bad, the more capitalistic we are, the more greedy we are. But the results are the opposite. __As Wright would predict, the more we end up engaging in market economies the kinder we are to strangers at least in these economic games.__ So that's I think one possible explanation for the expansion of sympathy in some places and not others. I think it has limited applicability. It doesn't explain our shifts in attitudes towards slaves or to racial minorities, or to non-human animals. But I think it does explain some of what's going on. Other forces for moral change are things we discussed earlier in the course. So we talked about empathy. We talked about how if you imagine yourself in the shoes of a distant stranger, you might end up treating them as if they were family or friend. And so empathetic appeals can expand our moral sentiments to people in faraway lands, either as individuals or possibly as groups. As in when Uncle Tom's Cabin got people to, to, to, for the first time, perhaps, put themselves in the shoes of slaves and therefore expand the moral circle to include them. There's interdependence. There's emotional appeals, like empathy. And finally, there is reason. 

I'll just sort of go back to this, and I'll actually start in a bit of a different direction with a point that Steven Pinker raises in this wonderful book, The Better Angels of our Nature. So he has this discussion where he says, the Old Testament says you know, love thy neighbor. The New Testament says love thy neighbor and it also says love thy enemy. And then Pinker says, you know, I don't love either one. I don't love my neighbor. I don't love my enemy. But I don't kill them. Sometime I help them. And the reason I don't kill them and the reason I sometimes help them is because I have conceptions they're pe, they're people. That they have rights and interests just like I do. I have conceptions of, of broader moral principles, of human rights. To some extent these principles might be grounded in a utilitarian idea, that, that we should try to maximize, you know, happiness for everybody. Or Kantian ideas that there are moral principles that should be followed. But it's not the emotion that's driving me. It's the reason. It's the reasoned understanding. 

And we saw this as well, in, in, with Adam Smith. With Adam Smith's example of how we are willing to give up personal gain, we are willing to endure personal suffering to, to, to help people we don't know. And, and, and Smith, you know, asked the question where does this come from? So I'll repeat I, I, you, he, he says, when our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish, how comes it that our active principle should often be so generous and so noble? And his answer is that it is reason, principle, conscience. This calls to us, with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions, that we are but one of the multitude, in no respect better than any other in it. And I think if there's, if there's one moral I want to leave you with, one conclusion I want to sort of express in this class, well there was more than one. One would be the, the, the, the, the power of our initial understanding of morality. How much of morality is hardwired? __But the one I'm pushing now is the power of reason, the power of rational liberation to sort of think about what's right on what's wrong, to expand our moral circle, to deliberate and discuss and contemplate and make ourselves better people.__ And I think, in some way, that's what we are doing just right now as we think about these issues and discuss them and argue about them. 

And, and as a way to illustrate how complicated and difficult things are, I want to end this week by going back to Peter Singer's metaphor of the expanding circle. And many of us are tempted to say what moral progress is, is the circle gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. __And I think this is a very legitimate view. I think part of the problem, by anybody's measure of previous moralities, is that they've been too small. It's a wrong morality if it includes just your family, and nobody else. It's a wrong morality if it places men in the center and women outside the circle, or whites in the center or blacks outside the circle. And so, for most of human history the problem of our morality can be simply summed up, the circle's too damn small.__ But, it's not as simple as to say that the circle should get bigger and bigger and bigger. Because if the circle, the circle should include as morally relevant beings, all the beings who are, in fact, morally relevant. If you think that rocks and trees have rights and privileges and should not be harmed, that's going to affect people. And I think that's actually kind of a, could be a foolish and dangerous view. People might differ a lot about the moral rights and capacities of chickens. But it's important to get it right, because your decision about what to do about chickens will affect people's lives, will affect how people make their livelihood, what people eat, and so on.

To take a very difficult case, there are many there are many liberals. People that have sort of liberal political persuasion, who constantly think the moral circle needs to get bigger and bigger and bigger. So then you could ask people who say this, should it include zygotes and fetuses and embryos. An answer may be yes. The answer may be they would say yes, it should include these creatures as well. Or it might be no, they don't deserve to be in a moral circle. Putting them in a moral circle would compromise the rights and freedoms of women. I do not begin to be able to answer the question what's the right what to do about this. __But my point is just that, that it is, it is naturally tempting to think that the circle should get bigger and bigger, but that falls apart. The question is, in the end is, how big should it get? And what should we and should we not include within it? To me the hardest question of morality is our obligation to distant strangers. It's clear to me, based on all, a lot of arguments we've talked about, a lot of moral views, that we have some obligation to strangers, if only not, if, not to kill them. But I think often to help them. But the question of how much of our resources we should give them, that we are morally obliged to give them, to take away from ourselves and our family, and them over, I have a feeling the answer is a lot.__ But I don't think the answer is everything. And I think that their different moral perspectives involving a, a utilitarian view, that adds up pain and pleasure and says give just about everything you own to other people clashes with other moral principles that we hold dear. And I'm raising this in some way to say that, that as we, as we explore moral psychology and its implications, it's really important to also have some humility. And to recognize that we're going to come across some deeply hard and important problems that we don't even know how to begin to solve.

## Unbelievable Stories About Apathy and Altruism

Some of Becker's most compelling early research concerned altruism. He argued, for instance, that the same person who might be purely selfish in business could be exceedingly altruistic among people he knew -- although, importantly, he predicted that altruism even within a family would have a strategic element. Years later, the economists Doug Bernheim, Andrei Shleifer, and Larry Summers empirically demonstrated Becker's point. Using data from a U.S. government longitudinal study, they showed that an elderly parent in a retirement home is more likely to be visited by his grown children if they are expecting a sizable inheritance.

But wait, you say: maybe the offspring of wealthy families are simply more caring toward their elderly parents?

A reasonable conjecture -- in which case you'd expect an only child of wealthy parents to be especially dutiful. But the data show no increase in retirement- home visits if a wealthy family has only one grown child; there need to be at least two. This suggests that the visits increase because of competition between siblings for the parent's estate.

Economists have traditionally assumed that the typical person makes rational decisions in line with his own self- interest.

How can we know whether an act is altruistic or self- serving? If you help rebuild a neighbor's barn, is it because you're a moral person or because you know your own barn might burn down someday? When a donor gives millions to his alma mater, is it because he cares about the pursuit of knowledge or because he gets his name plastered on the football stadium?

People give half of money in Dictator as opposed to $2. But if they can take money from the other person, then fewer people gave. And if they can take all of Zelda's money, 40% would take all.

If Annika/Zelda worked for the money, just 28% took from Zelda, and 2/3 didn't give or take.

If your only option in the lab is to give away some money, you probably will. But in the real world, that is rarely your only option. The final version of his experiment, with the envelope-stuffing, was perhaps most compelling. It suggests that when a person comes into some money honestly and believes that another person has done the same, she neither gives away what she earned nor takes what doesn't belong to her.

It may appear altruistic when you donate $100 to your local public radio station, but in exchange you get a year of guilt- free listening (and, if you're lucky, a canvas tote bag). U.S. citizens are easily the world's leaders in per-capita charitable contributions, but the U.S. tax code is among the most generous in allowing deductions for those contributions.

Most giving is, as economists call it, impure altruism or warm-glow altruism. You give not only because you want to help but because it makes you look good, or feel good, or perhaps feel less bad.

Gary Becker once wrote that most people who give money to panhandlers do so only because "the unpleasant appearance or persuasive appeal of beggars makes them feel uncomfortable or guilty." That's why people often cross the street to avoid a panhandler but rarely cross over to visit one.

And what about U.S. organ-donation policy, based on its unyielding belief that altruism will satisfy the demand for organs -- how has that worked out?

Not so well. There are currently 80,000 people in the United States on a waiting list for a new kidney, but only some 16,000 transplants will be performed this year. This gap grows larger every year. More than 50,000 people on the list have died over the past twenty years, with at least 13,000 more falling off the list as they became too ill to have the operation.

If altruism were the answer, this demand for kidneys would have been met by a ready supply of donors. But it hasn't been. This has led some people -- including, not surprisingly, Gary Becker -- to call for a well-regulated market in human organs, whereby a person who surrenders an organ would be compensated in cash, a college scholarship, a tax break, or some other form. This proposal has so far been greeted with widespread repugnance and seems for now politically untenable.

Iran established a similar market nearly thirty years ago. Although this market has its flaws, anyone in Iran needing a kidney transplant does not have to go on a waiting list. The demand for transplantable kidneys is being fully met. The average American may not consider Iran the most forward- thinking nation in the world, but surely some credit should go to the only country that has recognized altruism for what it is -- and, importantly, what it's not.

If John List's research proves anything, it's that a question like "Are people innately altruistic?" is the wrong kind of question to ask. __People aren't "good" or "bad." People are people, and they respond to incentives. They can nearly always be manipulated -- for good or ill -- if only you find the right levers.__


## A History of Violence    Edge Master Class 2011
[Link](http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker)

I'm going to present six major historical declines of violence; in each case, cite their immediate causes in terms of what historians have told us are the likely historical antecedents in that era; and then speculate on their ultimate causes, in terms of general historical forces acting on human nature.

__"Pacification Process."__ Until about five thousand years ago, humans lived in anarchy without central government. What was life like in this state of nature? This is a question that thinkers have speculated on for centuries, most prominently Hobbs, who famously said that in a state of nature "the life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." A century later he was countered by Jean Jacques Rousseau, who says, "Nothing could be more gentle than man in his primitive state."

There are 20 archaeological samples that I know of for which these analyses have been done. I've plotted here the percentage of deaths due to violent trauma. They range as high as 60 percent, and the average is a little bit more than 15 percent.

Let’s compare that rate with those of modern states, and let's stack the deck against modernity by picking some of the most violent eras that we can think of. This is the United States and Europe in the 20th century. This is the entire world in the 20th century—and I've thrown in not only the wars, but also the genocides and the manmade famines. It's about three percent, compared to the 15 percent rate in pre-state societies. And here is the world in the first decade of the 21st century. The bar in the graph would be less than a pixel, about a three one-hundredths of one percent.

There are 27 samples that I know of, where ethnographic demographers that have done the calculation. I've plotted them as war deaths per 100,000 people per year. They go as high as 1500, but the average across these 27 non-state societies is a little bit more than 500. Again, let's stack the deck against modernity by picking some of the most violent modern societies for comparison, such as, for example, Germany in the 20th century, with its two world war: its rate is around 135, compared to 524 for the non-state societies. Russia in the 20th century, with two world wars, a revolution, and a civil war, is about 130. Japan in the 20th century, about 30. United States in the 20th century, with two world wars plus five wars in Asia, is about a pixel.

So: not to put too fine a point on it, but when it comes to life in a state of nature, Hobbs was right, Rousseau was wrong.

What was the immediate cause? It was almost certainly the rise and expansion of states. Anyone who is familiar with world history knows about the various paxes—the pax Romana, pax Islamica, pax Hispanica, and so on. It's the historian's term for the phenomenon in which, when a state expands or an empire imposes hegemony over a territory, they try to stamp out tribal raiding and feuding. That is what drives the statistics down.

It's not that these early states had any benevolent interest in the welfare of their subjects, but rather, that tribal raiding and feuding is a nuisance to imperial overlords.  For the same reason that a farmer will take steps to prevent its cattle from killing each other —it's a dead loss to the farmer—Imperial overlords tend to frown on tribal battles that just shuffle resources and destroy the tax base at a net loss to them.

#### Civilizing Process

The second major historical decline of violence can be captured in this woodcut of a typical day in the life in the Middle Ages. The decline has been called the __"Civilizing Process."__

I've plotted them here on a logarithmic scale, so that the scale goes from 100 homicides per 100,000 per year, to ten, to one, to a tenth of a homicide. And as you can see, there's an almost two order-of-magnitude decline in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present.

So a contemporary Englishman has about a 50-fold less chance of being murdered than his compatriot in the Middle Ages. This is a phenomenon that is not restricted to England. It is true of every European country for which statistics are available. Again, here is a logarithmic scale, and the homicide rates goes from between ten and 100 down to a very narrow window of about one per 100,000 per year.

The immediate cause was first identified by Norbert Elias in his classic book The Civilizing Process, from which I got the name for this development. In the transition from Middle Ages to modernity there was a consolidation of centralized states and kingdoms throughout Europe. Criminal justice was nationalized, and warlords, feuding, and brigandage were replaced by "the king's justice."

Simultaneously, there was a growing infrastructure of commerce: a development of the institutions of money and finance, and of technologies of transportation and time keeping. The result was to shift the incentive structure from zero-sum plunder to positive-sum trade.

#### Humanitarian Revolution

The third historical decline of violence pertains to the fact that those first states, though they did bring down rates of feuding and vendetta and blood revenge, were rather nasty contraptions, which kept people in a state of awe with techniques such as breaking on the wheel, burning at the stake, sawing in half, impalement, and clawing. In a process that historians call the "Humanitarian Revolution", these forms of institutionalized violence were eventually abolished. The momentum for this movement was concentrated in the 18th century.

This graph shows the abolition of judicial torture (that is, torture as a form of punishment) in the major countries of the day, including the famous prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment by the 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Also during this period there was a reduction in the use of the death penalty for non-lethal crimes. In 18th century England there were 222 capital offenses on the books, including poaching, counterfeiting, robbing a rabbit warren, being in the company of gypsies, and "strong evidence of malice in a child seven to 14 years of age." By 1861 the number of capital crimes was down to four.

Similarly, in the United States in the 17th and 18th centuries, the death penalty was prescribed and used for theft, sodomy, bestiality, adultery, witchcraft, concealing birth, slave revolt, counterfeiting, and horse theft. We have statistics for capital punishment in the United States since colonial times. As you can see, in the 17th century a majority of executions were for crimes other than homicide. In current times, the only crime that is punished by capital punishment other than homicide is conspiracy to commit homicide.

The death penalty itself, of course, has been abolished in most of Europe. Most of the abolitions were concentrated in the last fifty years. This is the number of European countries with capital punishment. Currently, only Russia and Belarus have it had on the books.

But interestingly, even before capital punishment was abolished by the stroke of a pen, it had fallen into disuse. You can see that the percentage of European countries that actually carry out executions has always been far lower, and the decline began much earlier.

Now the United States, of course, notoriously is the only Western democracy that has capital punishment (though only in two-thirds of the states), a number that has been dwindling. And to say that the United States has the death penalty is a bit of a fiction. If you look at the number of executions as a proportion of the population, it has been plunging since colonial times. Today, out of about 16,500 homicides per year, there are about 50 executions, and that rate has been in decline as well.

This graph shows the cumulative number of countries that abolished slavery. For the first time in history, slavery is illegal everywhere in the world. The last countries to abolish it were Saudi Arabia in 1962, and Mauritania in 1980.

#### Causes of the Humanitarian Revolution

Affluence: As one's life becomes more pleasant, one places a higher value on life in general. However, I don't think the timing works.
    
This is a graph of per capita income in England over the last 800 years. Most economic historians say that the world saw virtually no increase in affluence until the time of the Industrial Revolution starting in the early decades of the 19th century. But most of the reforms that I've been talking about were concentrated in the 18th century, when income growth was pretty much flat.

__However, there is one technology that showed a precocious increase in productivity before the Industrial Revolution, and that was printing.__ Here's a graph showing the efficiency in book production, which increased 25-fold by 1700. The efficiency was put into use, and resulted in an exponential growth in the number of books published per year in England, France, and other western European countries.

And there were more literate people around to read them. By the 18th century a majority of men in England were literate.

__Why should literacy matter? A number of the causes are summed up by the term "Enlightenment." For one thing, knowledge replaced superstition and ignorance: beliefs such as that Jews poisoned wells, heretics go to hell, witches cause crop failures, children are possessed, and Africans are brutish. As Voltaire said, "Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities."__

Also, literacy gives rise to cosmopolitanism. It is plausible that the reading of history, journalism, and fiction puts people into the habit of inhabiting other peoples' minds, which could increase empathy and therefore make cruelty less appealing. This is a point I'll return to later in the talk.

#### The Long Peace

The fourth historical decline of violence has been called the "Long Peace." It speaks to the widespread belief that the 20th century was the most violent in history, which would seem to go against everything that I've said so far. Peculiarly, one never sees, in any of the claims that the 20th century was the most violent in history, any numbers from any century other than the 20th.

There's no question that there was a lot of violence in the 20th century. But take, for comparison, the so-called peaceful 19th century. That "peaceful"  century had the Napoleonic wars, with four million deaths, one of the worst in history; the Taiping Rebellion in China, by far the worst civil war in history, with 20 million deaths; the worst war in American history, the Civil War; the reign of Shaka Zulu in southern Africa, resulting in one to two million deaths; the war of the Triple Alliance, which is probably the most destructive interstate war in history in terms of percentage of the population killed, namely 60 percent of Paraguay; the African slave raiding wars (no one has any idea what the death toll was); and of course, imperial wars in Africa, Asia and the South Pacific.

These remarks are all qualitative, meant to damp down the tendency to think that just because in Europe there was a span of several decades without war, that the world as a whole was peaceful in the 19th century as a whole.

Now, it is undoubtedly true that the Second World War was the deadliest event in human history in terms of number of lives lost. But it's not so clear that it was the deadliest event in terms of percentage of the world population. Here is a graph that I've adapted from a forthcoming book by Matthew White entitled The Great Big Book of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's 100 Worst Atrocities. White calls himself an "atrocitologist." He tries to fit numbers to wars, genocides, and manmade famines throughout history.

Here we see 2500 years of human history, with White's top 100 atrocities, which I have scaled by the estimated size of the world population at the time. As you can see, World War II just barely makes the top ten. There are many events more deadly than World War I. And events which killed from a tenth of one percent of the population of the world to ten percent were pretty much evenly sprinkled over 2500 years of history.

Now this funnel-like concentration of points in the last few centuries does not mean that in ancient times they only committed big atrocities, whereas now we commit both big and little atrocities. It's rather an artifact of "historical myopia": the closer you get to the present, the more information you have. The smaller atrocities in the past were trees falling in the forest with no one to hear them, or not even deemed worthy of being written down.

Let's zoom in now on the last 500 years. There is a data set from Jack Levy on trends in great power war. These are wars that involve the 800-pound gorillas of the day, that is the countries that can project military power outside their boundaries, which account for a disproportionate amount of the damage due to war (because wars fall along a power law distribution of damage).

The first graph shows the percentage of time that the great powers were at war. We see that five hundred years ago, the great powers were pretty much always at war with one another, and then the proportion of each quarter-century filled with great-power wars declined steadily. The next one shows the duration of wars involving the great powers—also a decline. Here is one that shows the number of great-power wars initiated per year, and that figure, too, declines steadily over the half-millennium.

But now we see a graph of the deadliness of war, which shows a trend that goes in the opposite direction—though wars involving great powers were fewer in number, they did more damage per country per year. Even that trend, though, did an about-face after 1950, when for the first time in modern history, great-power wars became simultaneously fewer in number, shorter in duration, and less deadly per unit time. 

Now let’s zoom in on the last century, the 20th century. Here is a graph showing deaths in war all over the world, not just those involving the great powers. It shows that the increase in deadliness of war did indeed result in two horrific spikes of bloodletting centered on the two world wars. But since then there has been a long stretch without that degree of bloodletting. The fact that the 20th century comprises 100 years, not just 50 years, is one of the reasons why it's misleading to say that the 20th century was the most violent in history.

 [QUESTION: Which population figures are you using to calculate rates of death in war?]

The denominator here is the world population, not the population size of countries involved in each war. There are arguments for doing it either way. The problem is that you can make the numbers go all over the place depending on the choice of the denominator, whether you choose the country that initiated the war, the collateral damage in other countries, the neighboring countries, and so on. So in all cases I've plotted deaths as a proportion of world population.

The extraordinary 65-year stretch since the end of the Second World War has been called the "Long Peace", and has perhaps the most striking statistics of all, zero. There were zero wars between the United States and the Soviet Union (the two superpowers of the era), contrary to every expert prediction. No nuclear weapon has been used in war since Nagasaki, again, confounding everyone's expectations. There have been no wars between any subset of the great powers since the end of the Korean War in 1953. There have been zero wars between Western European countries. The extraordinary thing about this fact is how un-extraordinary it sounds. If I say I'm going to predict that in my lifetime France and Germany will not go to war, everyone will say, "Yeah, yeah; of course they won't go to war." But that is an extraordinary statement when you consider that before 1945, Western European countries initiated two new wars per year for more than 600 years. That number has now stood at zero for 65 years.

And there have been zero wars between developed countries at all. We take it for granted nowadays that war is something that happens only in poor, primitive countries. That, too, is an extraordinary development; war used to be something that rich countries did, too. Europe, which traditionally has been the part of the world with the biggest military might, is no longer picking on countries in other parts of the world, or hurling artillery shells at one other with the rest of the world suffering collateral damage. This change has been extraordinary.

Now, what about the rest of the world? What has happened in the other continents while Europe has been racking up its peaceful zeros?

First let’s look at the number of wars. These graphs start at 1946 and they span the entire globe. I'll divide it into the different categories of war.

One kind of war has vanished off the face of the earth. The colonial war (red), which used to be quite destructive, no longer exists, because the European powers have given up their colonies. (This is, by the way, a stacked layer graph, so the relevant visual variable is the thickness of the layers.)



 

Here (blue) we see the fate of interstate wars, wars between two sovereign states. These have also been dwindling since the end of the Second World War. However, the number of civil wars—both pure civil wars within a country (green) and internationalized civil wars (orange), where some foreign country butts in, usually on the side of the government defending itself against an insurgency—increased until about 1990, and then has shown somewhat of a decrease as well.

So since 1946 there have been fewer wars between states, but there been more civil wars, mainly because newly independent states with inept governments were challenged by insurgent movements, and both sides were armed by the Cold War powers. But even civil wars declined after 1991 with the end of the Cold War and the stoking of these proxy wars by the superpowers.

The crucial question now is: what kills more people, the fewer number of wars between countries, or the greater number of wars within countries? This graph shows the deadliness of interstate wars since the 1950s, that is, how many people are killed in a particular year of war. As you can see, the numbers has plummeted (I've already talked about that fact).

The tall blue bars represent deaths in interstate war, and as you can see they have plummeted over the decades. Much shorter are the internationalized civil wars (orange) and the civil wars (green). The fact that we have more civil wars and fewer interstate wars means that the total number of people has gone down, because the interstate wars of the past killed far more people than the civil wars of the present.

    
 

Now let's put the numbers back together, and instead of looking at the number of wars, look at number of deaths, again scaled by world population. This stacked-layer graph shows the number of people killed in wars since 1946. Here are the colonial wars (red). Here we see the number of people killed in interstate wars (blue), with spikes corresponding to the eras of the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Iran/Iraq War. These are the numbers of people killed in civil wars (green) and internationalized civil wars (orange).

The trajectory has been, to be sure, bumpy, but in the first decade of the 21st century, we are actually living in a time that even in comparison to recent decades is comparatively peaceable. In fact, one could almost say that the dream of the 1960s folk singers is coming true: the world is putting an end to war.

What about genocide? The last couple of graphs plot what are called "state-based conflicts, where you have two organized armed forces fighting, at least one of which is a government. What about cases in which governments kill their own citizens? Again, there's a cliché that the 20th century was the Age of Genocide. But the claim is never made with any systemic comparison of previous centuries.

Historians who have tried to track genocide over the centuries are unanimous that the notion that the 20th was "a century of genocide" is a myth. Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn, their The History and Sociology of Genocide, write on page one, "Genocide has been practiced in all regions of the world and during all periods in history."

What did change during the 20th century was that for the first time people started to care about genocide. It's the century in which the word "genocide" was coined and in which, for the first time, genocide was considered a bad thing, something to be denied instead of boasted about.

As Chalk and Jonassohn say of ancient histories, "We know that empires have disappeared and that cities were destroyed, and we suspect that some wars were genocidal in their results. But we do not know what happened to the bulk of the populations involved in these events. Their fate was simply too unimportant. When they were mentioned at all, they were usually lumped together with the herds of ox and sheep and other livestock."

To give some examples: if Old Testament history were taken literally, there were genocides on almost every page; the Amalakites, Amarites, Canaanites, Hivites, Hitites, Jevasites, Midianites, Parazites and many other. Also, genocides were committed by the Athenians in Melos; by the Romans in Carthage; and during the Mongol invasions, the Crusades, the European wars of religion, and the colonization of the Americas, Africa and Australia.



 

We have something even resembling numbers only for the 20th century. But if we plot those numbers, they refute the impression that the massacres in Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur are indications that nothing has changed, that the world has learned nothing since the Holocaust. This graph shows the best estimates that we can find of rates of death in genocide. Is certainly true that there was a burst of genocides from the 1930s to the early '50s in Europe, and from the '20s through the '70s in Asia. But the trend since World War II has been downward. It is definitely not the case that "nothing has changed" since the era of the Second World War. Even with the Rwanda genocide, a small proportion of the world’s population, compared to earlier decades, is massacred by their governments.

So what are the immediate causes of the Long Peace, and what I call the new peace (that is, the Post-Cold War era)? They were anticipated by Immanuel Kant in his remarkable essay, "Perpetual Peace" from 1795, in which he suggested that democracy, trade and an international community were pacifying forces. The hypothesis has been taken up again by a pair of political scientists, Bruce Russett and John Oneal, who have shown that all three forces increased in the second half of the 20th century. In a set of regression analyses, they showed that all of them are statistical predictors of peace, holding everything else constant.

    
    
 

Specifically, the number of democracies has increased since the Second World War, and again since the end of the Cold War, relative to the number of autocracies. There's been a steady increase in international trade since the end of the Second World War. There's been a continuous increase in the number of intergovernmental organizations that countries have entered into. And especially since the end of the Cold War in 1990, there's been an increase in the number of international peace-keeping missions, and even more importantly, the number of international peace keepers that have kept themselves in between warring nations mostly in the developing world.

The final historical development I call the Rights Revolutions. This is the reduction of systemic violence at smaller scales against vulnerable populations such as racial minorities, women, children, homosexuals and animals.

    
    
 

The civil rights revolution saw a reduction in the once socially-sanctioned practice of lynching. There used to be 150 lynchings per year in the United States, over the course of the 20th century the number has gone down to zero. Hate crime murders of blacks, which started to be recorded in the mid-1990s, went down from the single digits to one per year. Non-lethal hate crimes such as intimidation and assault have also been in decline since they were first measured.

Also, the kinds of racist attitudes that encourage violence against minorities, such as the percentage of Americans saying that they would move if a black family moved in next door, or believe that black and white students should go to separate schools, has now fallen into the noise—the range of crank opinion—and is basically indistinguishable from zero.



 

This is a trend that has taken place not just in the United States, but worldwide. The number of countries that have laws on the books that discriminate against ethnic, religious, or racial minorities has been in steady decline. In fact, the number of countries that have tried to tilt the scale in the other direction with affirmative action and remedial discrimination policies has increased. So now more countries in the world discriminate in favor of disadvantaged minorities than discriminate against them.

    


 

The women's rights movement has seen an 80 percent reduction in rape since the early '70s when it was put on the agenda as a feminist issue. There has also been a two-thirds decline in domestic violence, spousal abuse, or wife beating, and a 50 percent decline in husband beating. In the most extreme form of domestic violence, namely uxoricide and matricide, there's been a decline both in the number of wives that are murdered by their husband's and the number of husbands that have been murdered by their wives. In fact, the decrease is much more dramatic for husbands. Feminism has been very good to men, who are now much more likely to survive a marriage without getting murdered by their wives.

    
    
 

The children's rights movement has seen a decline in the United States of the number of states that permit corporal punishment in schools, such as "paddling" and "hiding." In much of Europe, it's been abolished outright. But even in the United States, it's been in decline. The approval of spanking and the implementation of spanking have been in decline in every country in which they have been measured. Here are data from the United States, New Zealand and Sweden. In fact, spanking, even by parents, is illegal in many European countries now. Child abuse, too, has been in decline since statistics were recorded in the early 1990s. And violence in schools, such as fighting and bullying, has been in decline.

    


 

The gay rights movement has seen an increase in the number of states in the world, and American states, that have decriminalized homosexuality (it used to be a felony). Anti-gay attitudes have been in steady decline, such as whether homosexuality is "morally wrong," whether it should be made illegal, and whether gay people should be denied equal opportunity. Hate crimes of intimidation against gays have been in decline since they were first measured.

    


 

The animal rights movement has seen a decline in hunting, an increase in vegetarianism, and a decrease in the number of motion pictures in which animals have been harmed.

The key question now is: Why has violence declined over so many different scales of time and magnitude? One possibility is that human nature has changed, and that people have lost their inclinations towards violence. I consider this to be unlikely. For one thing, people continue to take enormous pleasure, and allocate a lot of their disposable income, to consuming simulated violence, such as in murder mysteries, Greek tragedy, Shakespearean dramas, Mel Gibson movies, video games and hockey.

But perhaps more to the point are studies of homicidal fantasies, which ask people the following question: "Have you ever fantasized about killing someone you don't like?" When you ask that question of a demographic with a very low rate of actual violence, namely American university students, you find that about 15 percent of the women and a third of the men frequently fantasize about killing people they don't like; and more than 60 percent of women and three-quarters of men at least occasionally fantasize about killing people they don't like. (And the rest of them are lying—or at least might sympathize with Clarence Darrow when he said, "I've never killed a man, but I've taken great pleasure in reading many obituaries."

A more likely possibility is that human nature comprises inclinations toward violence and inclinations that counteract them—what Abraham Lincoln called the "better angels of our nature." Historical circumstances have increasingly favored these peaceable inclinations.

What are the parts of human nature that militate toward violence? I count five, depending on how you lump or split them.

There's raw exploitation, that is, seeking something that you want where a living thing happens to be in the way; examples include rape, plunder, conquest, and the elimination of rivals. There’s nothing particularly fancy in the psychology of this kind of violence other than a zeroing out of whatever inclinations would inhibit us from that kind of exploitation.

There's the drive toward dominance, both the competition among individuals to be alpha male, and the competition among groups for ethnic, racial, national or religious supremacy or pre-eminence.

There's the thirst for revenge, the kind of moralistic violence that inspires vendettas, rough justice, and cruel punishments.

And then there's ideology which might be the biggest contributor of all (such as in militant religions, nationalism, fascism, Nazism, and communism), leading to large-scale violence via a pernicious cost- benefit analysis. What these ideologies have in common is that they posit a utopia that is infinitely good for infinitely long. You do the math: if the ends are infinitely good, then the means can be arbitrarily violent and you're still on the positive side of the moral ledger. Also, what do you do with people who learn about an infinitely perfect world nonetheless oppose it? Well, they are arbitrarily evil, and deserve arbitrarily severe punishment.

Now let's turn to the brighter side, our so-called better angels.

They include the faculty of self-control: the ability to anticipate the consequences of behavior, and inhibit violent impulses. There’s the faculty of empathy (more technically, sympathy), the ability to feel others' pain. There’s the moral sense, which comprise a variety of intuitions including tribalism, authority, purity, and fairness. The moral sense actually goes in both directions: it can push people to be more violent or less violent, depending on how it is deployed. And then there is reason, the cognitive faculties that allow us to engage in objective, detached analysis.

Now we face the crucial question: Which historical developments bring out our better angels? I'm going to suggest there are four.

The first implies that Hobbes got it right: a Leviathan, namely a state and justice system with a monopoly on legitimate use of violence, can reduce aggregate violence by eliminating the incentives for exploitative attack; by reducing the need for deterrence and vengeance (because Leviathan is going to deter your enemies so you don't have to), and by circumventing self-serving biases. One of the major discoveries of social and evolutionary psychology in the past several decades is that people tend to exaggerate their adversary's malevolence and exaggerate their own innocence. Self-serving biases can stoke cycles of revenge when you have two sides, each of them intoxicated with their own sense of rectitude and moral infallibility.

Historical evidence that the Leviathan is a major pacifying force includes the first two historical developments that I spoke of, namely the Pacifying and Civilizing Processes, both of which were consequences of the rise of states. Also the fact that reversals in the trends, where violence re-erupts, tend to take place in zones of anarchy, like the American Wild West, failed states, collapsed empires, and mafias and street gangs that deal in contraband (so they can't call in the court system to enforce their interests in business disputes but have to resort to intimidation and revenge). A final kind of evidence is the demonstrable effectiveness of international peace-keepers, who use a kind of soft power on the international stage to keep warring parties apart.

The second pacifying force is identified by the theory of "Gentle Commerce." Plunder is a zero-sum or even a negative sum game: the victors' gain is the loser's loss. Trade, in contrast, is a positive-sum game. (We will hear more from both Leda and Martin that reciprocal altruism, such as gains in trade, can result in both sides being better off after an interaction.) Over the course of history, improvements in technology have allowed goods and ideas to be traded over longer distances, among larger groups of people, and at lower cost, all of which change the incentive structure so that other people become more valuable alive than dead. To be concrete: I doubt that the United States is going to declare war on China (though there's much that we don't like about that country), because they make all our stuff. And I doubt China will declare war on us, because we owe them too much money.

Some historical evidence comes from statistical studies showing that countries with open economies and greater international trade are less likely to engage in war, are less likely to host civil wars, and have genocides.

A third pacifying force is what Peter Singer called the "Expanding Circle," although Charles Darwin in first stated the idea in The Descent of Man. According to this theory, evolution bequeathed us with a sense of empathy. That's the good news; the bad news is that by default, we apply it only to a narrow circle of allies and family. But over history, one can see the circle of empathy expanding: from the village to the clan to the tribe to the nation to more recently to other races, both sexes, children, and even other species.

This just begs the question of what expanded the circle. I think one can argue that the forces of cosmopolitanism pushed it outward: exposure to history, literature, media, journalism, and travel encourages people to adopt the perspective of a real or fictitious other person. Experiments by Daniel Batson and others have shown that reading a person’s words indeed leads to an increase in empathy, not just for that person, but also for the category that the person represents.

Historical evidence includes the timing of the Humanitarian Revolution of the 18th century, which was preceded by the Republic of Letters, the great increase in written discourse. Similarly, the Long Peace and Rights Revolutions in the second half of the 20th century were simultaneous with the "electronic global village." And perhaps—this is highly speculative—but it's often been stated that the rise of the Internet and of social media might have been behind the color revolutions and the Arab Spring of the 21st century.

I think the final and perhaps the most profound pacifying force is an "escalator of reason." As literacy, education, and the intensity of public discourse increase, people are encouraged to think more abstractly and more universally, and that will inevitably push in the direction of a reduction of violence. People will be tempted to rise above their parochial vantage point, making it harder to privilege their own interests over others. Reason leads to the replacement of a morality based on tribalism, authority and puritanism with a morality based on fairness and universal rules. And it encourages people to recognize the futility of cycles of violence, and to see violence as a problem to be solved rather than as a contest to be won.

What's the evidence for reason being a pacifying force which has helped to propel the decline of violence? We do know that abstract reasoning abilities (as measured by the most abstract components of an IQ test) have increased in the 20th century. The so-called Flynn Effect consists of an increase of about three IQ points per decade since the beginning of the 20th century, and the gains have been concentrated not in factual knowledge such as vocabulary and information, but rather, in abstract reasoning (such as in Similarities questions, like "What do an egg and a seed have in common?" and  "What do an inch and a pound have in common.")

It's been shown that people (both at the level of individuals and of entire societies) who have higher levels of education and measured intelligence commit fewer violent crimes, cooperate more in experimental games (we'll hear today from Martin Nowak and Leda Cosmides about these games), have more classically-liberal attitudes, are less likely to be racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, and are more receptive to democracy.

Whatever the causes of the decline of violence, it has profound implications. One of them is it calls for a reorientation of our efforts toward violence reduction from a moralistic mindset to an empirical mindset. It leads us to ask not just the question "Why is there war?" but, what might be a better question, "Why is there peace?" Not just "What are we doing wrong?" but "What have we been doing right?" Because we have been doing something right, and it seems to me that's it’s important to understand what it is.

In addition, the decline of violence has implications for our assessment of modernity: the centuries-long erosion of family, tribe, tradition and religion by the forces of individualism, cosmopolitanism, reason and science.

Now, everyone acknowledges that modernity has given us longer and healthier lives, less ignorance and superstition, and richer experiences. But there is a widespread romantic movement which questions the price. Is it really worth it to have a few years of better health if the price is muggings, terrorism, holocausts, world wars, gulags, and nuclear weapons?

I argue that despite impressions, the long-term trend, though certainly halting and incomplete, is that violence of all kinds is decreasing. This calls for a rehabilitation of a concept of modernity and progress, and for a sense of gratitude for the institutions of civilization and enlightenment that have made it possible.
 

Q & A

BENEDICT CAREY: You mentioned at the beginning that there's no guarantee that this will continue. What are some of the things that you think are most likely to upset the trend and bump it up again?

STEVEN PINKER: One is the "unknown unknowns", to quote Donald Rumsfeld. Things that could come out of the blue. Some fanatical dictator under the sway of a new ideology festering somewhere in the world who will gather supporters, take over a country, and decide that it's a good idea to re-conquer the neighbors. That kind of thing can happen. We don't know where, we don't know when, and it's unwise to predict that current trends will continue smoothly.

It's also possible that some fanatic who gets his hands on a stray nuclear weapon could send the statistics skyward. One guy or one radical cell or one group could do a lot of damage. It’s then almost a philosophical question whether this would constitute a counterexample to the world becoming less violent. No one else might think that the violence is a good idea, but one person or small groups could rack up big numbers.

It's also conceivable that climate change will cause a struggle over land or water. I might add that that is not a given.  Studies that have tried to correlate resource scarcity and climate shocks at Time 1 with violence at Time 2 (everything else held constant) have found virtually no correlation. Famines can cause a lot of misery, and they can sometimes cause local skirmishes over watering holes, but in general, they don't lead to wars, because wars require the decision of some organized government or militia, whose leaders may not care about whether the population are starving or not in the calculations that lead them to declare war.

The United States, for example, during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, didn't have a civil war. The civil war that we did have was over quite another matter.

NICHOLAS PRITZKER: I've heard, probably on bad authority and a small sampling, that there's no evidence of violence among Cro-Magnon populations. Is there any proof to that rumor?

STEVEN PINKER: We don't have enough skeletons to know. There's some indirect evidence that violence goes back earlier than Cro-Magnon. For one thing, depending on how you interpret the evolutionary continuity, common chimpanzees engage in what we would call genocide if it occurred among humans—perhaps we should call it chimpicide—and probably the common ancestor of humans and chimps did as well.

There is evidence for violent trauma and cannibalism in Homo heidelbergensis, which is close to the common ancestor of Neanderthals and sapiens. Also, in our genome, there are genes that defend us against the prion diseases that are transmitted through cannibalism, suggesting that cannibalism goes back several hundred thousand years. And the fact that we're a sexually dimorphic species, with the males bigger than the females, which you tend to find, on average, in species that have more violent male/male competition. All of this is indirect evidence that say that violence goes back a long way.

And while I think you're right that there's no direct evidence of violence in Cro-Magnon, there are cave paintings showing war, though the oldest that we know of is from about 6,000 years ago.

STEWART BRAND: I imagine there are some people that are quite offended by your thesis. I'm wondering, whom are you hearing from and what are you hearing?

STEVEN PINKER: There are a number of people for whom this is an unwelcome message. Activists of various kinds don't like to hear good news because, by their reckoning, it encourages complacency: "Oh, so you’re saying the world is okay. Then why bother stamping out human trafficking?"  and so on. I actually think they're mistaken even in the practical implications. It's much more likely that people reading about nothing but horrific events, say in Africa, would write off the whole continent as a hell hole. "Why throw money into a snake pit? Maybe they were better off when they were colonized, and independence was a bad idea." The fact that some peace-building measures actually work, I argue, is more of a reason to put effort and money into Africa.  I think good news will actually encourage the right kinds of activism,  rather than discourage them.

On the other side is a kind of conservative romanticism about pre-modernity: the Enlightenment was a terrible mistake, things were better when people had the moral clarity of church and family and community. This communitarian romanticism has both right-wing and left-wing flavors: religious romanticism and green romanticism.

Then there is an Americocentric theory of world history that says that everything bad happening in the world can be attributed to the actions of the United States. In that vaguely Chomskyan theory of politics, if you say that there's anything good about western civilization, that's considered reactionary.

Finally, there’s a belief among many anarchists and radical libertarians who that all evil is caused by the state. To them, Leviathan theories are highly offensive.

DANIEL KAHNEMAN: I'm just curious whether you see a decline in the ability to dehumanize categories of people? If we look at genocides in the 20th century, Nazi Germany, Srebrenica, you get people who are fairly normal in every way and they can become convinced that there is no difference between other people and animals. And it happens, clearly, can be made to happen, intelligence is no defense against it; literacy is no defense against it. And what are the forces do you think that...

STEVEN PINKER: I would put it the other way around. The default probably is that you do dehumanize out of your small circle, and what we are seeing are the remaining pockets of default dehumanization, or of backsliding.

There are two mindsets that allow these atrocities to happen. One is dehumanizing, where you consider other groups of people less than human. Then there's demonizing, where you consider them to be fully human, which makes them all the more contemptible because of the evil choices that they've made. Daniel Goldhagen has set up a 2 X 2 taxonomy of genocides according to whether the victims were demonized, de-humanized, or both.

For example, well before the 20th century one sees descriptions of Native Americans by settlers, colonists, and governments that use the metaphor of vermin. When it was asked, for example, after various massacres, "Why kill all the children, if it's just the warriors that have been harassing you; why kill the babies?," the answer, independently offered by a number of colonists was, "If you want to get rid of the lice you have to kill the nits." This is the same language that was used by Oliver Cromwell in his genocides during the re-conquest of Ireland.

I do agree that literacy, and certainly intellectualism, are not guarantees against a dehumanizing mindset, but they are probably statistical forces that push against it.  Cosmopolitanism, including reading accounts of what it's like to be a Native American or a Vietnamese peasant, are likely to reduce the probability of de-humanization. But it is a tendency we naturally backslide into.

JARON LANIER: I'd like to hypothesize one civilizing force, which is the perception of multiple overlapping hierarchies of status. I've observed this to be helpful in work dealing with rehabilitating gang members in Oakland. When there are multiple overlapping hierarchies of status there is more of a chance of people not fighting their superior within the status chain. And the more severe the imposition of the single hierarchy in people's lives, the more likely they are to engage in conflict with one another. Part of America's success is the confusion factor of understanding how to assess somebody's status.

STEVEN PINKER: That's a profound observation. There are studies showing that violence is more common when people are confined to one pecking order, and all of their social worth depends on where they are in that hierarchy, whereas if they belong to multiple overlapping groups, they can always seek affirmations of worth elsewhere. For example, if I do something stupid when I'm driving, and someone gives me the finger and calls me an asshole, it's not the end of the world: I think to myself, I’m a tenured professor at Harvard. On the other hand, if status among men in the street was my only source of worth in life, I might have road rage and pull out a gun.

Modernity comprises a lot of things, and it's hard to tease them apart. But I suspect that when you're not confined to a village or a clan, and you can seek your fortunes in a wide world, that is a pacifying force for exactly that reason. Also, projecting upward to the way we intellectualize our affairs, an interesting development over the 20th century is the concept that you can be, say, Jewish and American, and this is not a conflict. You can be Italian-American, and the hyphen doesn't compromise either identity.

We take it for granted that we may have loyalties that go in different directions, but it's surprising how recent this appreciation is. There's a quote from that great "progressive" president Woodrow Wilson (who kin fact purged the federal government of black employees, and re-segregated Princeton when he was president of the university). He said, "Any American who carries around a hyphen is wielding a dagger aimed at the heart of the republic." It seems Neanderthal today, but he obviously was a smart man, and it made sense to him and to other people at the time. Today we think, "Well, you go to Knights of Columbus and that's the Italian part, and you salute the flag and that's the American part, and what's the big deal? These are two overlapping polities that we belong to." But that involves some cognitive sophistication. The default is to essentialize people, and you can't have two essences—it's not an essence if there are two of them. And so this style of abstract thinking with overlapping matrices may be part of the Flynn-effect driven increase in tolerance and classical liberalism.

LEDA COSMIDES: I was wondering two things. One is very odd. You were talking about dehumanization, and there's starting to be evidence that people who frame things more in terms of in-group and out-group have more outward fear, and also have a greater perceived vulnerability to disease. They feel that they're more vulnerable to disease and since you're living in close contact with your family and friends, you already have their germs. But the people who you're most likely to catch diseases from are people from other groups.

I was wondering, in looking at these trends, if you're seeing any trends in decline in the fear of groups and the kinds of war that can go along with increases in public health that would decrease people's perceived vulnerability to disease?

STEVEN PINKER: Randy Thornhill claims that there is such a correlation.

LEDA COSMIDES: Well, it's not just Randy. There have been more and more people who are finding that kind of link between pathogen fears and ingroup-outgroup psychology.

STEVEN PINKER: It's certainly possible. I suspect that it's more driven cognitively by who you naturally categorize as on the outside of your circle of group identity. But it's possible that the size of that circle is driven by some kind of fear of contamination.

LEDA COSMIDES: Right, I think that's the claim. But the real question I had was about the cosmopolitanism, because I'm puzzled by that in a certain sense. It almost sounds, like "come be an undergraduate and everything is going to be okay." I'm wondering if that is a real factor that's contributing to this. It must be driven a lot by popular culture because you don't have massive numbers of people reading Proust and etc.

STEVEN PINKER: It's a rising tide that lifts all the boats. It sounds elitist to say this, but attitudes toward women, homosexuals, and racial minorities, and the tolerant attitudes that we celebrate of not beating up your kids, tend to start among the most educated strata,  and you can see the rest of the country being dragged behind. With a lot of these statistics, the red states today have attitudes that the blue states had 30 years ago—toward women, towards spanking, towards homosexuals, towards animal rights, and so on.

What starts out at the universities and the pundits can trickle down and become conventional wisdom. That probably happens worldwide as well. This is another thing I'll probably get flak for saying, but very roughly you can see a continuum in the world in a lot of variables related to the decline of violence: Western Europe, then the American blue states, then the American red states, then Latin America and Asian democracies, and the Islamic world and Africa pulling up the rear. We can look, say, at the criminalization of homosexuality in Africa, or human trafficking, and say the world is in a terrible state, which of course it is. But the historical trend is that the other parts of the world eventually catch up. Slavery is a concrete example: just fifty years ago, slavery was still legal in Saudi Arabia.

LEDA COSMIDES: But that's the legal part. I thought there was, quantitatively, an increase in slavery, alarming increase in slavery recently.

STEVEN PINKER: No, I don't think there is. For one thing, human trafficking can't be compared to African slavery in terms of the death rate, the suffering inflicted on the people, or the amount of time that it lasts in a person's life. And even human trafficking involves a fraction of the percentage of people that used to be slaves when slavery was legal and ubiquitous. Probably there have been centuries in the past in which the majority of the world's population could be classified as slaves. What you're seeing here is a common dynamic:  there's a sudden increase in concern, which looks like an increase in incidence. We care about it now. Fifty years ago people didn’t.

GEORGE DYSON: A question about when you speak to nuclear weaponeers they like to take a lot of credit. They'll say, look what we did may have been bad, but look, we had no major war. They like to take your graph and make a very different conclusion and take the credit for it. Do you think they're taking more credit than they deserve?

STEVEN PINKER: Yes. Someone else [Elspeth Rostow] proposed that the nuclear bomb be given the Nobel Peace Prize! But I suspect not. For one thing, if you actually check to see whether the distribution of nuclear weapons predicts peace through deterrence, it rarely, if ever, does. For example, the Soviet Union established its hegemony over Eastern Europe in exactly the era in which the United States was a nuclear monopoly, the late 1940s. You also find lots of cases where a non-nuclear power challenged a nuclear power, like Argentina challenging Britain in the Falklands, Egypt challenging Israel in 1973, many countries challenging the United States, colonial Algeria seceding from France, and so forth.

There are two reasons that nuclear weapons probably haven’t been a critical factor. Since 1962, but probably growing before that, there has been a "nuclear taboo," the idea that nuclear weapons live in a sphere of hypotheticals, that you use them to defend yourself against an existential threat but in actual battlefield calculations it's not a live option. The last time it was breathed as a live option was when Barry Goldwater mused that there was no reason not to use tactical nuclear weapons in Vietnam, which led to the "Daisy" ad, and to Lyndon Johnson winning the biggest landslide in electoral history.

Nuclear weapons, paradoxically, are so militarily useless that they haven't really affected balance of power considerations. This is not to deny that deterrence has been important, just that the massive amount of destruction that countries like the U.S. and the USSR could inflict with conventional weaponry made each very nervous about the other even if neither side had had nuclear weapons. World War II in Europe didn't involve nuclear weapons, but was a kind of destruction that no one wanted to see again. The theory of the Nuclear Peace is quite popular, but I’m skeptical.

GEORGE DYSON: It's important for you to say that.

JENNIFER JACQUET: Do you think it's possible that we've shifted the violence toward one another toward other life forms? Especially through mechanization—the idea that now we have factory farming and industrial fishing and things like that.

STEVEN PINKER: I suspect not. Cruelty and indifference to animals go back probably as far as our species goes back. What has changed is efficiency — we can scoop up fish faster than we used to —and certain changes in habits. Starting in the '60s, people got the idea that white meat is healthier than red meat. But if you switch your meat from beef to poultry, you need 200 chickens to provide the same amount of meat as one cow. That creates the demand for a vastly larger number of sentient lives to be brought into being and snuffed out to meet the same demand. People are no crueler; they just have come to prefer white meat and until recently have been indifferent to the source of their dinner. There's been a constant level of callousness and indifference, but there's been an increase in industrial efficiency.

Now, of course, there's also, for the first time in the West, a widespread concern about the welfare of the animals that gave their lives for our dinner. You see both an increase in vegetarianism, an increase in the number of laws passed that protect the rights of farm animals, and an increase in the efforts by the industrial farmers to at least project an image of caring for animals, which probably has led to improvements in their welfare.

There are still enormous unrealized gains to be made in reducing cruelty. But the historical direction is we care more rather than less, even if below people’s radar a lot more bad things were happening

MICHAEL GAZZANIGA: Everybody's always worried about the coming uptick in violence. Last week the Supreme Court tossed out this case Brown versus the gaming industry in violence, a seven to two decision. The minority opinion was written by Justice Breyer, who is generally viewed as the science judge. He goes into a long discussion, 50 references, about how it is demonstrated that watching violent games, video game playing, and so forth, leads to much greater violence in children, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And so therefore, this is so bad that it should trump fee speech aspects of the issue.

Do you have any thoughts on that? The things that the culture is doing, are there things out there boiling out around that may change this calculation? That may increase people's tendency toward violence for solutions problems, et cetera?

STEVEN PINKER: The Supreme Court made the right decision. In fact, I signed on to an amicus brief in California when the law was first challenged, because the science that attempts to show that watching violent video games makes kids violent is bad science. Most of it is blank-slate science: they do correlations showing that the kids who like violent entertainment are also kids who commit more violence, and they leap from cause to effect without factoring in the possibility that violent people like violent entertainment.

In terms of cause and effect, there's little, if any, evidence for a causal relationship, aside from irrelevant findings like, if you show kids the Three Stooges, they run around the lab a lot more—that's the "science." And historically, the great age of video game violence, which has been since the 1990s (and it is gruesome stuff) are exactly the decades in which violence in the United States plummeted.

Violent crime in all western countries has declined. There was an opposite trend I haven’t talked about, but you may have noticed in the graphs: when I plotted the rate of violence in European countries from the Middle Ages to the present, it went way down, and then there was a little uptick in the 1960s. It was a little bounce in violence that lasted through the '60s, '70s and '80s then got reversed in the '90s. This decade has brought us back to some of the lowest rates of violence in American history, 4.8 per 100,000 per year. (The lowest was 4.0, in the late '50s.) The new decline took place exactly when video games exploded. And there's a reason for the lack of a causal relationship.

Violent entertainment goes way back, including special effects by Shakespearean actors who would have concealed bladders filled with pig blood, so that when one stabbed the other, there would be a big spurt of gore. People have always liked violent entertainment. The correlation with behavior is poor because of the way human motivation works. When are people violent? It's when they want someone else to come to harm. That accounts for most of the variance in violence. How often you see it done, whether you see it done in your imagination, is separate from how many other people in the world you want dead. And that's why I think that video games are a red herring.

DANIEL KAHNEMAN: Have you commented on what happens on the statistics of soldiers firing their guns?

STEVEN PINKER: Yes. There is a widely spread factoid that most soldiers are inhibited from firing their guns in a battle.

DANIEL KAHNEMAN: There has been training that is very effective so that soldiers currently do fire their guns.

STEVEN PINKER: Yes. And this is sometimes used in the service of the idea that we have innate inhibitions against killing.

There is, I agree, such a feature of human psychology: we don't physically harm another person, particularly an innocent stranger,  lightly. The reason that this feature of human psychology is misleading is that it's an inhibition that is not only easy to overcome, but pleasurable to overcome. It's in the same category as an aversion to eating spicy foods or strong cheese or rock climbing. There is an innate tendency to avoid it but there's tremendous pleasure taken in overcoming that avoidance. And of course, the history of hand-to-hand combat going back to Homeric Greece shows that people very easily lose whatever inhibitions they have against causing direct bodily harm.

The second reason that an aversion to hands-on killing is misleading is that most human violence is not mano-a-mano physical conflict, but "cowardly violence." It's pre-dawn raids, it's ambushes, it's drive-by shootings. The inhibition we have works as follows: If you meet an adversary, then since on average he will be as big and strong and mean as you are, you should not give him reason to kill you by attacking him when there’s nothing in it for you (as in a conscript army in battle against a national enemy). But when you can get away with violence without fear of reprisal, inhibitions are gone. In tribal conflict, that's where the big numbers pile up—sneaky ambushes and raids.

One reason I think anthropologists were misled about non-state violence, until they started counting rates of death in primitive warfare, is that they only looked at "pitched battles," where you have the two sides in war paint with spears and drums and they make a lot of noise and then one side backs down. That led to the conclusion that primitive violence is only ritualistic. But the observers didn't count all the times in which one tribe would tiptoe into another village before dawn, then fire arrows through people as they left their huts in the morning to pee, and then annihilate the entire village. That's what gives rise to the high counts.

JOHN TOOBY: As you know, I'm in agreement with almost all of your argument, especially about very long term trends. Very well founded are the events that are aggregated over large populations. But when you start to enter a world with small numbers of nation states, individual events count, individual decision makers count, as you say. And so if you look at World War II, right before World War II, fascism independently took control in Italy and Portugal, Spain, Germany, Hungary, on and on. Add in the Marxian, Soviet celebration of a certain type of war. Then essentially, all of continental Europe except the Netherlands and Switzerland and a few small places went in that direction.

Then, if you look at the outcome of the war, it was a very close thing, that is, for a while it was only Britain against the continent of Europe and it could have very easily gone in the George Orwell direction. …

STEVEN PINKER: In fact it did in half of Europe, the eastern half ...

JOHN TOOBY: Exactly. That's one cautionary element to me. And then I think about what's the likelihood that every conceivable trend would be in the right direction. For example, it's hard to look at what I think of as the writ of the Enlightenment, liberal democracy as spreading inevitably when in fact it was spread by the armies of the English-speaking peoples—imposed by force on Japan and Continental Europe in World War II. And then if you look at other places—you would like to think, and when I was young, I used to think that spontaneously, everybody would vote for democracy if they could. But you look at places like Africa or the Middle East, and they've proven remarkably resistant, and high levels of warfare go on with this resistance.

One also wonders whether the world has now crossed a threshold with, for example, the rise of automatic weapons. Could the U.S. have formed a liberal democracy if everybody had had automatic weapons? Or is it the same kind of thing as the Colonies, even though every teenager in Africa, 13 year olds—not everyone, but large numbers—have automatic weapons. You have this hellish circumstance, and you wonder, would it have been similar here?

I'm also worried that the initial sort of liberal revolution that led to this sort of openness and a cosmopolitan direction also leads culturally to people in these democracies who are now largely unwilling to defend themselves. If you look at Europe, Secretary of Defense Gates said they are unable to sustain a campaign of more than a few weeks outside of Europe.

STEVEN PINKER: Robert Kagan says, "Americans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus."

JOHN TOOBY: But even in the U.S., blue-staters are European. If you look at who goes into the army, there are all of these myths that it is stupid people or ignorant people or the poor, but it's not.  It's middle class, rural people who are slightly better educated than average and who are religious. Those people are getting fewer in the liberal cosmopolitan revolution. Dennis Miller has the line that we have our pet medications Federal Expressed to our front doors, and al-Qaeda looks at that, and thinks, we can take those guys.  

STEVEN PINKER: Those are both excellent questions. Okay, the first one. It is certainly true that there can be enormously contingent events where a small number of people can do a lot of damage, and those uncommon but consequential events can blindside you. And that was why, in answer to Ben's question, I cited that as the kind of thing that could go wrong.

But there are two ways of thinking about it. You could say we've been amazingly lucky and it could all blow at any moment. But you could also say that the world just went through an extraordinary run of bad luck. If Hitler had been gassed a little bit more thoroughly in the trenches in World War I, there probably would have been no World War II in Europe, there probably would have been no nuclear arms race, et cetera, et cetera.

So it goes both ways. The question is, how have the odds been shifting? Is the probability of Hitler coming to power in Germany now the same as it was in the '30s? It's not zero. But it's probably less.

A few years ago you could have worried that large parts of the world just couldn't stand the idea of liberal democracy. With the Arab Spring we have to reassess even that. And the Arab spring did not just come out of the blue in the last six months. A Gallup poll of the Islamic world conducted in 2005 had a lot of surprises. There was a large current of liberalism that was seething beneath the surface of the ayatollahs and theocrats on the one side, and the oily kleptocrats on the other side. I wouldn't say a majority—the numbers depend on the country—but support for democracy, freedom of speech, women's rights was found in a substantial proportion of the Islamic world, in some of the countries a majority, which makes the Arab Spring not a total surprise.

Now, I wouldn't go so far as, say, Francis Fukuyama, who suggests that history has a momentum in that direction, that we’re seeing a grand dialectical process culminating in "the end of history." I would localize it to more circumscribed processes like technology, cosmopolitanism, and the spread of ideas. But we can't discount the possibility that liberal democracy ultimately is a pretty attractive vision. And that maybe, like cell phones, when it's available it becomes a gadget that most people find appealing. I wouldn't predict with confidence that that's going to happen, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happened.
