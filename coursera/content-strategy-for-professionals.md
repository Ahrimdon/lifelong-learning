## 1.1 Introduction by John Lavine

To begin, no problem is more challenging or significant to organizations than effectively communicating their essential stories to important people inside and outside who need to know about them.

Yet think how often you share your content and the people you want to reach pay no attention. Then again, in this digital age, even if the people you want to reach do pay attention, once you send the message out, others can change it or add to it or make it into something, that you never intended and you may not like.

Why is communicating effectively so challenging?

The blunt answer is that the people you want to reach face an ever-rising tidal wave of content demanding their attention, but they don't have one more minute in their day. This MOOC welcomes that challenge. During our time together, we will show you how to develop engaging content in print and digital and social and mobile media that people you want to reach will use.

And in the process, you'll learn how to understand far more about your audience and how to make the content that you create more valuable to them. A rapidly increasing number of for-profit and not-for-profit enterprises recognize the ferocious competition they face to get the time and the attention of target audiences they want to reach.

So a really important lesson is that in a world that's becoming ever more complicated, the people you want to reach will pay attention to your content if it enhances their lives in ways they value.

#### What is Content Strategy?

Content strategy tells people what they want and need to know in ways that are credible and trustworthy and transparent.

## 1.2: What is Content Strategy

Content strategy tells people what they want and need to know in ways that are credible, trustworthy, transparent. Content strategy is also related to, but quite distinct from content marketing.

Content marketing, it's explicitly crafted to drive specific profitable customer action.

By contrast, content strategy is crafted to help a target audience be better informed and smarter. So if you think about the world of mass communication, there is this spectrum.

It's a content spectrum. And journalism is on one end. Its goal is to inform people. And marketing is on the other, and its goal is to drive customer action.

Content strategy falls somewhere in the middle, but slightly towards journalism. So here's an example. Take a look at this picture. If you show this picture as part of a story of poor children in developing countries which is a major problem being addressed by many agencies, it's content strategy.

If your priority is to tell a story about children in the third world, who are served by the work of a non profit agency that focuses on improving their lives, then it's content marketing.

And if you're part of the audience who sees them, you get a different message from one that focuses only on the child versus one that also promotes the NGO that helps them.

Perceptive organizations are responding to people's needs to be better informed about products and services by creating content strategy, where information about topics that matter to the organization and its employees or stakeholders, shine.

#### Phillips

The Philips plus project introductory video makes two points. The overt and stated one is that Philips has mounted a collaborative effort to meet people's modern day health and well being challenges.

Those are the words that any number of companies might use, but Phillips is committing major resources to deliver on that promise and they're doing it collaboratively with people in the region that they serve.

The second goal for Philips is that they have made a conscious decision to move from being a global company that makes products, to one that also innovates.

This story is an example of both of the Plus Project's goals. First, mounting a collaborative effort to meet people's modern day health and well-being challenges, and second, doing so through meaningful innovation.

## 1.3: John's Three Truths

The competition for time and attention of people everywhere is under assault, and pressure on their time will continue to rise.

Just think how of many times you and your colleagues or friends have talked about having too much to read, or to see, or to do, and not enough time to do it. There has never been a moment in history when there's been more information available, or when the challenges communicating effectively has been as great.

There's a tidal wave of new and seemingly ever-changing technologies also to deliver that information.  As a result, most people say communications and media face constant, unrelenting change.

Yet that's not quite accurate. In the 1980s, we were teaching about the end of the traditional divisions between media and the move to content that would be available, kind of where and when and however people wanted it.

As part of this ongoing work to chisel out insights about disruptive changes that typify media and communications, the media management center reported on three forces that will not change as they shape all forms of communication in the future.

#### There's an ever-rising tidal wave of information about every subject, and it will continue to rise forever.

2011: 16M hits for "coffee cup". 2013: 130M hits.

If there are that many results for something as mundane as a coffee cup, think of the amount of information there is about absolutely every subject.

And if that isn't one way to think about it, try this. These get replaced by Google Glass. Google Glass is connected to my cell phone, which is connected to the internet, which is connected to the world. And on this little lens, I can ask Glass to give me a map to go around the world, I can ask it to show me the latest news, I can read the latest book ,or take a video of you if you're there.

Think of all the ways we've just begun to nick at, that will be opened up by thiskind of technology, by wrist watches and other things that will tie us to the rest of the world.

## Each of us has only 24 hours in our day, 1440 minutes.

No amount of technological or scientific advance will ever add one more minute to that 1440 minute day that you have, and I have, and everyone has.

If you put together the first truth about the tidal wave and the second truth about the absolute number of minutes.

If you were interested even in coffee cups, look at all of the other activities that are competing for your time.

Eating, sleeping, working, learning, being with colleagues, being with family, significant others and friends.

The lesson here is that important things, like eating, or talking to your boss, or family member, are competing, all the time, for your attention, and for the attention of the people you want to reach with your content.

It's vital that you recognize that ferocious competition.

Indeed, it's helpful to picture the person or people you hope will pay attention to your content and recognize that their first priority, is something that matters to them.

It's not your message. Actually, even if the information you're sending their way is valuable to them, the pressure on their lives to do other essential things nearly always outweighs what you want them to know.

## The third truth is that the world is becoming an ever more complicated place.

That's good, because if you can give people what they really want, they may give you their time. But how are you going to get the audience's precious attention?

To begin, you must have a far deeper understanding of that audience. One that goes way beyond what content creators typically possess. In addition, even if your content is valuable, and you can get them to pay attention, your messages must be engaging and delivered where, when, and how they want it.

If it's boring, or delivered at work when they only have time to read it later on on the bus, or at home, when they want to be with their kids, they won't look at it at all.
