## 1.1 Introduction by John Lavine

To begin, no problem is more challenging or significant to organizations than effectively communicating their essential stories to important people inside and outside who need to know about them.

Yet think how often you share your content and the people you want to reach pay no attention. Then again, in this digital age, even if the people you want to reach do pay attention, once you send the message out, others can change it or add to it or make it into something, that you never intended and you may not like.

Why is communicating effectively so challenging?

The blunt answer is that the people you want to reach face an ever-rising tidal wave of content demanding their attention, but they don't have one more minute in their day. This MOOC welcomes that challenge. During our time together, we will show you how to develop engaging content in print and digital and social and mobile media that people you want to reach will use.

And in the process, you'll learn how to understand far more about your audience and how to make the content that you create more valuable to them. A rapidly increasing number of for-profit and not-for-profit enterprises recognize the ferocious competition they face to get the time and the attention of target audiences they want to reach.

So a really important lesson is that in a world that's becoming ever more complicated, the people you want to reach will pay attention to your content if it enhances their lives in ways they value.

#### What is Content Strategy?

Content strategy tells people what they want and need to know in ways that are credible and trustworthy and transparent.

## 1.2: What is Content Strategy

Content strategy tells people what they want and need to know in ways that are credible, trustworthy, transparent. Content strategy is also related to, but quite distinct from content marketing.

Content marketing, it's explicitly crafted to drive specific profitable customer action.

By contrast, content strategy is crafted to help a target audience be better informed and smarter. So if you think about the world of mass communication, there is this spectrum.

It's a content spectrum. And journalism is on one end. Its goal is to inform people. And marketing is on the other, and its goal is to drive customer action.

Content strategy falls somewhere in the middle, but slightly towards journalism. So here's an example. Take a look at this picture. If you show this picture as part of a story of poor children in developing countries which is a major problem being addressed by many agencies, it's content strategy.

If your priority is to tell a story about children in the third world, who are served by the work of a non profit agency that focuses on improving their lives, then it's content marketing.

And if you're part of the audience who sees them, you get a different message from one that focuses only on the child versus one that also promotes the NGO that helps them.

Perceptive organizations are responding to people's needs to be better informed about products and services by creating content strategy, where information about topics that matter to the organization and its employees or stakeholders, shine.

#### Phillips

The Philips plus project introductory video makes two points. The overt and stated one is that Philips has mounted a collaborative effort to meet people's modern day health and well being challenges.

Those are the words that any number of companies might use, but Phillips is committing major resources to deliver on that promise and they're doing it collaboratively with people in the region that they serve.

The second goal for Philips is that they have made a conscious decision to move from being a global company that makes products, to one that also innovates.

This story is an example of both of the Plus Project's goals. First, mounting a collaborative effort to meet people's modern day health and well-being challenges, and second, doing so through meaningful innovation.

## 1.3: John's Three Truths

The competition for time and attention of people everywhere is under assault, and pressure on their time will continue to rise.

Just think how of many times you and your colleagues or friends have talked about having too much to read, or to see, or to do, and not enough time to do it. There has never been a moment in history when there's been more information available, or when the challenges communicating effectively has been as great.

There's a tidal wave of new and seemingly ever-changing technologies also to deliver that information.  As a result, most people say communications and media face constant, unrelenting change.

Yet that's not quite accurate. In the 1980s, we were teaching about the end of the traditional divisions between media and the move to content that would be available, kind of where and when and however people wanted it.

As part of this ongoing work to chisel out insights about disruptive changes that typify media and communications, the media management center reported on three forces that will not change as they shape all forms of communication in the future.

#### There's an ever-rising tidal wave of information about every subject, and it will continue to rise forever.

2011: 16M hits for "coffee cup". 2013: 130M hits.

If there are that many results for something as mundane as a coffee cup, think of the amount of information there is about absolutely every subject.

And if that isn't one way to think about it, try this. These get replaced by Google Glass. Google Glass is connected to my cell phone, which is connected to the internet, which is connected to the world. And on this little lens, I can ask Glass to give me a map to go around the world, I can ask it to show me the latest news, I can read the latest book ,or take a video of you if you're there.

Think of all the ways we've just begun to nick at, that will be opened up by thiskind of technology, by wrist watches and other things that will tie us to the rest of the world.

## Each of us has only 24 hours in our day, 1440 minutes.

No amount of technological or scientific advance will ever add one more minute to that 1440 minute day that you have, and I have, and everyone has.

If you put together the first truth about the tidal wave and the second truth about the absolute number of minutes.

If you were interested even in coffee cups, look at all of the other activities that are competing for your time.

Eating, sleeping, working, learning, being with colleagues, being with family, significant others and friends.

The lesson here is that important things, like eating, or talking to your boss, or family member, are competing, all the time, for your attention, and for the attention of the people you want to reach with your content.

It's vital that you recognize that ferocious competition.

Indeed, it's helpful to picture the person or people you hope will pay attention to your content and recognize that their first priority, is something that matters to them.

It's not your message. Actually, even if the information you're sending their way is valuable to them, the pressure on their lives to do other essential things nearly always outweighs what you want them to know.

## The third truth is that the world is becoming an ever more complicated place.

That's good, because if you can give people what they really want, they may give you their time. But how are you going to get the audience's precious attention?

To begin, you must have a far deeper understanding of that audience. One that goes way beyond what content creators typically possess. In addition, even if your content is valuable, and you can get them to pay attention, your messages must be engaging and delivered where, when, and how they want it.

If it's boring, or delivered at work when they only have time to read it later on on the bus, or at home, when they want to be with their kids, they won't look at it at all.

## 1.4 It's Not Smart if It's Not Strategic

It's tempting to put your energies into turning out lots of content that matters to you. But it's not smart, and it's not strategic.

Well, if people are going to pay attention to your content, you have to give up sending out too many messages, non-strategic messages.

You really want people to care about all of the things you think are important, but once again. Remember the pressures on their time and the fact that just because you created content, and put it out there doesn't mean they will really engage it.

Whether you like it or not, target audiences you want to reach will only give you the smallest amount of time and attention. So, if your organization's strategic goals are going to be met, your content should only be sent if it is a central part of those priorities.

That's the only way to win. So what is the strategy part of content strategy?

In its simplest, most straightforward form, strategy refers to the direction and the goals that people, often leaders, have, when they're thinking about where the organization should be going.

Whether it's a formal plan or not, you need to find out what your organization's top goals and priorities are for the next one to three years, or if you're in a department or division, What are its top goals that can support the organizations?

Top goals are priorities. Every organization has things it wants to do if it's going to make progress. Those goals are strategies, whether it calls them strategies or not.

## 1.5 Intro to Audience an Experiences

There are two steps that will greatly strengthen the likelihood of people engaging with the messages you want them to consider.

We just covered the first one, learn the strategicals of the organization and your role or department in it and focus on those goals and not a lot of other things.

What does it mean that you must understand far more about your audience?

__It starts with learning with what matters to them in their work and personal lives.__

The first imperative is to deliver value to empower customers. Think about what they value and how they behave.

How effectively can you develop content that truly meets your audiences needs and simultaneously conveys information that enhances your organizations goals?

For example, did you know that the more content you give people that they want, the more time they will spend on content that matters to you? Sadly, most content creators think that the message that is important to them should be carefully considered by everyone in the organization.

Well, there are two flaws in this approach. As we learned a moment ago, the content the organization wants to deliver should have value for the intended audience.

And it has to be told in an engaging way, where, when, and how the audience wants it. If this doesn't happen, the audience won't pay attention.

Further, for all but the most extraordinary events, only a fairly narrow set of people are likely to have interest and take time with the content you present.

So the more specifically you can describe and understand that narrow set of people, the better you'll be able to provide content that's meaningful to them.

So in summary, then, to be successful, you must understand the audience you're trying to reach. Make what you say valuable and engaging to them. That's the secret. 

And next, let me talk about a powerful way for your content to enhance engagement.

Pretend for a moment that you're walking down the street and there's an old 1950s coffee or tea shop. It's noisy, plainly furnished with old chairs and tables, but it has a good cup of coffee. Now, one block further down the street, there's another coffee shop. It, too, sells good coffee, but it's got comfortable chairs clustered around tables in a way that invites conversation. Has wi-fi and connections so people can work on their computers while they sip their beverage. It gives off an inviting setup and people really do meet there to work or to talk or to see their friends.

What's interesting for this discussion is why people choose the first shop instead of the second, or vice versa. If you interview a 100 people and asked why they decided to go to the old, 1950s, simple shop, they would say things like, Mm, it's convenient, it's on the way to work, it's fast. If you ask others why they chose the other shop, the one with the soft chairs and the wi-fi, they would say things like That shop wants me to come in. Or, I meet interesting people. Or, it's my office away from work.

Now think back over those responses, and they're pretty literal. A couple of things stand out. The first is that none of the respondents said anything about coffee. What they did say many times with the words I, and my, and me.

What this example showed us is actually a penetrating look at how every human being makes decisions about using their time for making a purchase for goods or services. 

__The first thing each of us considers is ourselves and our time.__ For the coffee shop example, they talked about convenience, speed, socializing, getting work done. When we did research and engaged thousands of people with written, spoken, and video content, they responded exactly the same way. Their first consideration was them.

Using sophisticatedk research and new methodology we determine what experiences motivated them, to be most engaged with the content they saw. When we tested our research in the Americas, Europe Asia and Africa, there were of course cultural differences. There are different ways to tell a story. Yet we suspected that how people decide to spend their time with content is not a function of culture. And that's exactly what we found. You will easily understand this when you see the list of experiences that prompted people to spend more time with content and become more engaged by it.

__Some of the key examples where the content makes me smarter, gives me something talk about, looks out for my interest, has the element of surprise or humor, it inspires me.__

But you always need to bear in mind the context, whose receiving the content and where are they when they want to access it? That's a package, all of those things operate together. It's important to also think about two other experiences, context and convenience.

As each day passes the impact of convenience rises. The more convenience you make access to the content you want people to pay attention to, the higher the likelihood they'll give you some of that essential resource, their time.

Think about your own life, and you'll understand the importance of convenience. If someone sends you something to read, but it arrives when you're driving a car, or riding a bicycle, you'll pay no attention to it.

If the message you get is a video, even a terrific and interesting one, you may not open it because you were doing something which was more important to you. It's inconvenient to view it at that time. If any of these situations apply, it's as if the content you care so much about does not exist.

The point is, you have to understand your audience, and once again, where, when, and how they want to take in the information you send.

And then there is context. When we began in truth one, when we discussed the rising tidal wave of information, and some of the technologies that frame the context around content strategy, Here's a deeper summary of what, that context is, and what it means to every organization.

First, the rise of social media, has changed how fast information flows. The communications landscape is awash with information. And then engagement, which driven by content. And it's now critical to communications really having an impact.

Companies and organizations are fast becoming publishers, broadcasters, innovators, and content influencers, and so are you. And then the time is now to bring all that power of content forward.

Of course the challenge, is to simultaneously, make it engaging. If content then is everything, how do you make it magnetic, attracting and lifting audiences?

Content must be story driven, useful, findable, current, engaging, flexible, and sharable. And the biggest word there is story. We think in stories, we react in stories, whether it's data or any other kind of content.

What's the story? And then as listed on the right, it also needs to be available in the most appropriate formats and channels, that matter most.

Not to you, but to the audience. And don't overlook in all of this the use of gaming. If they are well done, games are a powerful way to tell complex stories. They're also the story form that younger people often prefer.

Yes, content is king. If it is strategic and tells a story that's valued by the audience. In this course, you will learn to develop and distribute your content, and drive engagement with audiences that you want to reach. In the following weeks, we'll look at how you can not only understand that audience more deeply but how you can take whatever content you strategically select and present it in such a way that the audience gives it more time.

Because it says to them, and they will say in themselves, that makes me smarter. It gives me something to talk about.

## 2.1

You know, taking up people's time with non-strategic content is not only wasteful, it teaches the important audiences that you want to reach to pay no attention to everything you say.

What we know is that people will only learn about things that they're motivated to learn about. That is to say, people will accept what they need to know from an organization that delivers what they want to know.

You compounded blowing up the first by saying there really are no more mass audiences. For most people in organizations, they want everybody inside or everybody outside, to take in their message. They can't.

The organizations we see being particularly successful at reaching mass audiences are doing it because they aggregate a number of targeted audiences. So think about something as ubiquitous as Facebook. Facebook has a large mass audience, if you will, because it serves a number of different smaller audiences with a variety of needs. High schoolers are on there for a very different reason, John, than you and I are on there. And ultimately Facebook success in the marketplace is being able to aggregate all those targets into one product. And that's really where organizations need to be focusing if they want scale.

There really is science behind this. People's emotional and cognitive limitations are real. They can only attend to a certain number of topics deeply at one time. So people only pay attention to topics when they're motivated to do so, and there are things that precede motivation, and that's what's most important to organizations.

The idea that self-interest and social identification precede motivation. So organizations have to understand their audiences' social identifications and self-interest needs, so they can craft messages that serve them where they are.

Not only do I have to understand you and what you're interested in, I have to understand you, your lifestyle, your needs, and behaviors, so well, that I can predict what you need even if you don't know you need it.

One of the biggest mistakes organizations make is asking someone, what do you need? No one knew they needed an iPhone until iPhones were invented.

Organizations that are most successful are going to get ahead of that curve by understanding people's lifestyles, behaviors, attitudes, and crafting their messages to serve them where they are and advance their lifestyle in some significant way.

First, you gotta give me something that you just know I want. Because like my favorite newspaper, or magazine, or TV show, I'm going to come there because I know I'm going to get it. That's number one. And then you're going to anticipate a need cause you know so much about me and you're going to meet that need.

Exactly. And it may not be the message that I thought my organization initially wanted to deliver. It becomes something of a blend where the organization is serving its needs by understanding the audience better.

## 2.1 Creating Personas

There are a number of steps we go through to develop personas, but the key for organizations to understand is they're based on research.

They're not based on intuition. So it's about interviewing people in the target market. Following them and seeing what their daytime experiences are.

Learning about the target market from external stakeholders. Learning about the target market from secondary research that's been done. Crafting a real understanding of who the target user is. 

A major drug store here in the United States has used personas to help understand the aging population in the United States and how their shelving needs to be recrafted to serve an older American. So they're using actually, a suit that mimics aging.

The arthritis in your hands, what it's like to stand up, your ability to see the signs. And they've lowered the signs. They've made the shelves so it's easy to reach without asking for assistance. And they've increased the size of the type on the sign placard, so that people could see them as they continue to age. And their goal is really to appeal to that target market.

I think it's really important for us to stop looking at media as old and new media and start looking at media that meets people where they are. So if you think about communities where mass transportation is the primary way that people circulate throughout the community, we start to see print media work quite well, if it's available through mass transportation outlets.

However, if you think about a community where people primarily move around through cars, we certainly don't want people reading while they're driving a vehicle, Then all of a sudden, we have to think about iPods, music, something that's more audible, something that's read at home after the commute, as a way to communicate with people.

## Segmenting Your Audience

I think the one key to understanding segments is the harder it is to measure something the better it is in understanding an audience.

Geographic measurement, where someone lives, what block they're on, or demographic measurement, how old they are, how many children they have, those are weak measures of segmentation because ultimately, two 35 year olds may look very similar but have very different needs.

Something like psycho-graphic measurement. Who they are? What they need?

Segmenting based on those needs, values, motivations to consume information, those are going to be most successful for organizations. So again, the more difficult something is to measure, the more successful it is going to be as a segment in the market.

What's really important to keep in mind, especially if you're with a small organization, you think because you only have 12 employees, they must all be similar. 

But if you have some people in sales, and you have some people in product management, and you have other people who are handling your media components, ultimately, all those people have different psychographic needs as it relates to your organization. You have to understand the psychographic bend those people bring to the table to effectively communicate with them.

If you run a larger organization, your goal is to understand the subsets in your organization's marketplace, so that you have several buckets of people, if you will. So I'm not suggesting you have to follow 1200 people around to understand what their individual needs are, but I am saying understanding your communication base in a different way can help you craft better messages.

What I encourage organizations to do, like radio and television stations that are really looking at day parting in a significant way, is to understand what's happening in someone's life in the morning that's different than the afternoon, that's different from the evening.

When you're in the morning looking at a television station or listening to the radio, you're interested in the weather and what it takes for you to be successful that day at work or whatever you're going to do throughout your day.

At noontime, you're looking for something totally different. Updates on the news. Maybe. But something that's kind of light and helps you get through your day.

At the end of the day, you don't need a repeat for what you've already seen. So dayparting is sort of the beginning to understanding that. But deep understanding really comes from understanding the target market. In a way that you've never really thought about them before.

## Targeting an Audience with Experiences

Many people are interested in giving to service organizations that communicate a message about how it's going to affect their particular community.

But effects in communities can mean very different things. You may be interested in, for instance, how it's going to affect what's happening on your block.

I may be interested in how it's going to affect my children, and ultimately understanding the difference between what you and I value in our lives, allows those messages to be more thoughtful.

Should you be at the center of the target or should I be at the center of the target?

So service organizations really need to understand that self interest, the social identification pieces of audiences.

But we've talked about the first week and we certainly implied here That there's that, all that emotional, internal self I bring to the message you provide.

So I think the experience work is very important to understanding audiences, because when you start to look at some of the experiences and how it creates an emotional reaction to material.

So one particular example of say the time out experience. When we look at people who are consuming some kind of media messages because they enjoy a release from their regular life.

It's one of the reasons we see the success of reality television in America today. But also think about this is particularly attractive to women. We see women creating time out experiences especially if they're raising children. Working and then have a moment in the evening where they can curl up with a cup of coffee and now we even say the iPad, and consume material.

Time out experiences are not going to be fueled by you throwing information at them.

It's going to be a soft touch that really understands that moment in a woman's day. What kind of information she's looking for and make her more interested in your company's message.

And then the last big question, we began the MOOC saying it looks like, and we're finding more and more, that people dream in stories.

Think in stories, even when they get data and spreadsheets and information, They sort of take it and turned it into a story.

We see narrative storytelling as a huge piece of this. Stories really illuminate things for people, but the important thing to keep in mind when you're working for an organization is, Your definition of story may be different than mine.

So you really have to, again, that's why the target audience really matters. You have to understand the target's definition of storytelling, so that your company can achieve a successful relationship through the narrative it wants to share.

## 2.5 Marketing - Branding Your Content

In general, marketing is about understanding consumers and designing products and services to meet their needs and wants and, and communicating this to consumers that you've done this.

Marketing is relevant to content strategy in two ways. First, any content you produce is aproduct that you should market. To engage the people you want to reach, you must understand them.

Second, the content strategy needs to benefit the services or product that your organization creates.

Part of your content strategy is to be meaningful and relevant to the products your organization makes. That's true no matter what type of organization you're in, for-profit, not-profit, or government. In short, it should help to brand your products or services.

Strong brands relate to experiences that marketers know are important to the consumer segment that they're trying to target. We define experiences as the thoughts or feelings that consumers have about how the product helps them achieve some goal in their life.

If you look at Coke's advertising, it doesn't emphasize the product, brown fizzy liquid, at all. Instead, it links Coke with the experience of feeling happy. Then, when consumers want to feel happy they drink Coke and are taken to the Coke experience of happiness. By speaking to these experiences, they can engage the consumers in the brand.


## 2.6 Marketing - Branding Your Content Part 2

The most important thing is that in thinking about content strategy, you really make it clear in your own mind what the concept of brand is all about, and how you want to be relevant.

The best tool for doing this is to write a positioning statement that specifies who the target segment is, what the core concept of the brand is and how this is different from your competitors. You use this positioning statement to make sure that your content is relevant to the same experiences the brand speaks to.

The positioning statement is central to a content strategy because it is what keeps the content on strategy.

Ex: The company is Shenshi, a Chinese clothing retailer. It's not really their real name, but the case is based on the real company. The company wants to expand its brand of clothing internationally. They've already had a fair amount of success in China.

The brand has been very successful at creating three experiences for its
consumers. The first experience is inspiration. Which is about making people believe that they can accomplish things in their own lives.

Many brands have been successful because they inspire their users. A famous example is Nike, which challenges its customers to just do it.

A media brand that creates inspirational experiences for readers is Better Homes and Gardens. To understand how they create inspiration,
consider their regular column, I Did It, which usually features normal people who just did something special to their home or garden.

The focus of this column is not on how they did it, which would be much more of a utilitarian experience, but on the fact that they were able to do it.

The second experience is identity. Which is, seeing oneself as being a
successful person. Many fashion brands help their users by projecting a certain image. Just think about the image that wearing a Rolex watch or carrying a Gucci hand bag creates.

The brand, North Face, projects a different kind of image. But is also creating an identity experience.

The third experience that Senchu wants to create is utilitarian, which is all about giving useful advice and tips on how to use clothes to appear successful. One contact point is a sales person coming up to you in the store and recommending a certain shirt or tie to go with some suit that you're buying.

So in their positioning statement, Shenshi makes it clear that the segment targeted is men who dream of a brighter future, and the concept is that Shenshi makes you feel and appear more successful than you currently are.

This means that our strategy should be to make sure that our content is also associated with these three experiences. And the content should have these three experiences in common so that when someone encounters
the content, they have the same experiences that they have with the brand, and vice versa.

## 2.7 - Creating a Core Creative Concept

It's true that over time and every organization, you'll produce many different pieces of content, most likely even across different platforms. The key is that all of them should be tied to the experiences that your content strategy calls for.

This consists of having the general thematic storyline that is relevant to the experiences.

For example, with Coca Cola, the storyline is that Coca Cola is about enabling people to make themselves and others happier.

The idea is more familiar than it may sound. Think about things like Harry Potter. Its story line began as a book, that was then turned into movies, audio presentations, rides at theme parks, and all sorts of other content.

The story line at an abstract level has been told many times before. There is this bad guy Voldemort who wants to conquer death and rule the world. Harry Potter is the chosen one, who must stop him and save the world. One of the themes that comes up often is that Potter has to choose between doing what's right and what's easy. The task of fighting Voldemort seems impossible. And the audience is inspired by the courage he shows to do the right thing despite how futile the effort seems.

Participants can propose a thematic storyline for Shenshi. As you saw in the Coca Cola and Harry Potter examples, keep it general enough to that any individual piece of content will tell its own story, but rich enough to hold all the pieces together to make sure that they're relevant to the brand and experiences it's associated with.

And remember that the process begins with an organization having a brand for it's product or service that's based on creating certain experiences.

It will then create content that focuses on a common set of experiences. The content engages consumers by creating the experiences, which in turn reinforces the product brand in the mind of the consumer.

## 3.1: What are Experiences?

Experiences are the way people feel about things. It's how content or a consumer product makes them feel, particularly with content.

Does it make me feel smarter? Does it make me feel good about myself? Does it make me want to take action on what I read or heard or saw? It goes well beyond the utility of the content, or the utility of the consumer product.

Certainly we use content for the utility it gives us. We buy consumer products for the utility they give us, but we have choices in content, and we have choices in consumer products, and we pick the ones that tap into emotional responses.

If I've driven to the market in a Mercedes or other luxury car it's going to make me feel prestigious, or important. If I make that same trip in a high mileage car, like a Fiat for example, it's going to make me feel frugal, and like I've done well with my money. If I make that very same trip in a hybrid or an electric car, something like a Prius, it's going to make me feel like I did something good for the environment.

So the tool, served the same purpose, no matter which one I had, but each of them would make me feel different, and we consume content for the same reasons. We pick content that gives us experiences and makes us feel certain ways. All products and all content create user experiences.

The first thing we ask is what do we want people to feel. That's what experience is all about. So what's the relationship between audience experiences and audience engagement?

Engagement is something that's been studied for more than 50 years. And it's been defined a lot of different ways. But typically it's been defined by how much a person uses content.

How often they come to it? How much time they spend with it? But that's really an outcome. It's really not a definition of engagement.

Engagement is really the collective set of these emotional experiences that people have with your content or with your consumer product. It's how they see your brand in their head. It's not what you think about your brand. It's what they think about your brand.

## 3.2 - Why Do Experiences Matter

Experiences matter for three reasons.First, all content will create user experiences. It's going to make your readers, users certain some things, act certain ways, take action on things. It's inescapable. You can not make experience free content, even if you tried. 

Second, years of research show that experience drives usage. If people have positive experiences with your content, they will come back to it more frequently. They'll spend more time with it. If they have negative experiences with your content. They're going to use it less, they're going to come to it less.

Third, you as the content strategist have the ability to shape those experiences to make them positive or negative, to make them stronger or weaker. So you have control.

Experience contributes to usage and you can control those experiences. So how do you determine which experiences are right? By that I mean, which experiences are most likely to drive engagement?

Media management center research identified more than 40 experiences across all media. Some of those were positive and drove increased usage of content. Some of them were negative and inhibited usage of content.

For this program, we've selected four that we think are the most powerful, and that you should really be focused on using. 

- It makes me smarter about things that I care about.
- The second is that it looks out for my interests.
- The third is that it's convenient (easily accessible).
- It gives me something to talk about and share with others, what we call the social experience.


## 3.3 - Understanding the Experiences

During those one on one interviews, we found that there were hundreds of common themes, common statements that people made. So we took those statements and we put them into surveys and gave those to thousands more people.

From that, we were able to find these common experiences that went across all media, and all people.  Here are the consumer comments that underlie that particular experience.

So what's the process for creating a powerful experience? As with all things in content strategy, the process starts with understanding your audience.

Who are they? What are their lives like? What are their goals? What are their aspirations? Once you understand that, then you create a concept for your content.

So in this case study, it's not about what we do, it's not if we make affordable trendy clothing. It's about our service to the audience and that's built into the concept statement. In the case study where it says, we're for younger men who dream of a brighter future, the Shenshi brand of trendy but affordable fashion makes men feel and appear more successful to others than they are.

Know how this concept statement, does three things that all concept statements have to do. It describes the target audience, in this case young men.

It categorizes the product, trendy but affordable, and it describes the point of difference from similar products. It makes men feel successful. The concept guides the organization's creation of all its contacts with its audience.

And contacts are everything: publications, websites, mobile data, tweets, advertising, packaging, marketing, customer service. Once the concept is defined and you're delivering on those contacts, that builds the audience's idea of the concept.

How they feel about it then reinforces what they think about you. It becomes a two-way street. Consider one of the great global sports empires, ESPN. They operate seven US sports channels, an industry leading website that has editions for four countries, US, Australia, Brazil, UK.  So look at their concept statement. To serve sports fans wherever sports are watched, listened to, discussed, debated, read about. We're played.

And everything they do is in service to delivering that experience.

## 3.4 - How Experiences Apply to Content

Experiences are applied at three levels. The message level, the distribution level, and the strategic level.

The goal is to be strategic. An application at the message and the distribution level reinforce the overall strategic approach.

For the content strategist, the first thing you want to think about is, what stories am I going to tell, and what stories am I not going to tell?

If we think about our case study, an expanding company that's building lots of new plants, and is proud of that fact, nonetheless, telling a story about opening a new plant is probably not going to drive the experiences that you want for your audience.

But, if you've got a customer who's recently gotten a promotion, in part because he now dresses well using your fashions, now that's a story that you do want to tell, because it reinforces this inspiration, aspiration experience that you're trying to drive.

You can tell it is a just plain facts case or you can enhance it with story telling arts. You can make some simple choices, are we going to tell this story in text or are we going to use something like a photo montage?

When you move up to the distribution level you're now thinking about how all these messages, all these stories come together.

On any given channel, as a content strategist, you're not going to do this just one way. You're going to have a Twitter account, you're going to have a YouTube channel, you're going to put out press releases, you're going to send customer emails. You might have a magazine or a brochure. And what you have to do is make sure that all the messages, all the stories, on each of these individual channels matches the experience you're trying to deliver.

What experience matters for the audience, that has no meaning. What does have meaning is a story about someone rising in the organization, who is a young men, wearing our clothes.

And tell it then at the distribution level, where, when and how, that young man and other young man will be.

The strategic level is where it all comes together. This is where you want to make sure that all of your channels are delivering the same message in the same way.

First at the message level. Let's take a look at these two Canadian newspapers. This was in 2006. It was the day that the Canadian hockey team had lost all chance of getting a medal in the 2006 Olympics. And on that very same day, the women skaters and the women skiers took two golds and two silver medals.

The newspaper on the left took a real just  the facts ma'am approach as you can see. Serious, somber, not particularly engaging. The newspaper on the right clearly they were thinking they wanted to drive that talk about it and share experience. That headline is a headline to debate over, to talk about over at the water cooler.

They focused on their message. We want our readers to talk about the things we write about. And they stayed on it, now that's at the message level. The editors at both papers had exactly the same material to work with and chose two different ways to do it.

We saw Apple's ad, we know that they focus on simplicity, so let's look at all the ways they do it. The message level in content would be comparable to, the individual, design elements in their products and everything is simple.

If we compare product components to the message level, they do it with every component. Look at the way the power cord plugs into a Mac book. It's a magnet. You just slap it on there. You don't have to fuss around trying to stick prongs into a slot. It's kind of a message level. The product itself is comparable to the distribution level in the content world.

So if we look at one of their products The iPad. It's so easy it doesn't even come with an owners manual. Even a two year old can learn how to use it. Then at the strategic level Apple pulls that all together, every element of design, every product, every customer contact walking into one of their stores.

Looking at their ads. They're all simple. Everything makes it easy. And this differentiates them from their more complicated competitiors. 

I think I hear you saying one more thing, and the one more thing is, that's the sort of recipe, those are the steps, but the powerful message is, content strategy is by itself prioritized and important. But if you really wanted to have impact.

If you want to engage your audience with it, at the beginning you said, you create experiences whether you want to or not. So plan 'em. Understand that audience. Create an experience which makes them want more and makes them want to come back. And if you do that, then you'll have great content and an experience. And the audience will give you more time and come back more often. 

## 3.5: Development of Tone and Voice

Well, John, professional writing doesn't have to be dry. In fact, in most cases it should not be. Don Fry, an editor and writing coach who has worked with thousands of writers, puts it this way. He says that voice is how the author creates the illusion that the writer is speaking directly to the reader from the page. Or, I would add, the screen.

Like most writing coaches, Fry emphasizes the importance of speaking in a natural way to readers. In order to hold the attention and interest of an audience, the writer needs to speak in a voice the audience will recognize as someone like them.

Another way to put this, voice is the equivalent of a phone call from a trusted friend. You immediately tune in to what this person is saying to you.

People face a title wave of content, and they don't have one more minute in their day. People tune out a lot of this information because it's boring, it's uninteresting, it's not valuable to them.

So first you need to win their time and attention. What is it about your content that makes them want to read it? The voice that readers hear in your content should be a kind of personality.

Who is that personality? What is the tone of that communication? Voice conveys the persona of the writer. We also talk about tone in professional writing.

Tone is the mood of the writer's voice, tone gives a writing voice nuance, depth and color.

Ask yourself what is important about this information? Why do people need it? What is your relationship to the content? And to the target audience who will read it. Are you an expert, informing them about something new? Or perhaps, are you a member of a community of usersof a product or service, commenting for those in the know.

So, what about the Shenshi case? Perhaps you want to create content about affordable vacations in places attractive to middle class young people. Or maybe create a website covering entertainment news of interest to the Shenshi customer.

Each of these excerpts has distincitve voice and tone. The New York Times editorial voice is firm, measured, and harbors not an ounce of doubt. The Page Six voice, on the other hand, is the snide, cliche-ridden tabloid. The celebrity chaser. Intentionally disrespectful.

Tone and voice are core identifiers. When writing for your business colleagues, the same principles apply. Be yourself. Be direct. Be specific. Your voice conveys your personality and authority. Your tone conveys emotion, attitude. Do you sound like someone who knows what she or he is talking about? Does your writing voice make them want to hear what you have to say?


## 3.6 - Importane of a Unique Content Voice

Focus on how it is valuable to your audience because people will give you their time if you give them something they value. Will it help them keep up with information in their field? Will it help them get ahead in their careers? Will it give them something to talk about with their friends, colleagues, their bosses? Or is it their personal time out? Is your content what is missing in their lives?

You also need to consider and know your defining value. Could your competitive edge be convenience for example? Is one competitor perhaps reliable but only available once a week? Can you deliver updates more often via cellphone or email? Does your content make you stand out from your competitors?

For example, if your organization conducts research on a topic of particular interest, you could write about it on your organizations internal website and eventually publish it for external audiences. Your competitive advantage is your deep knowledge of the issue.

Look at this graphic that summarizes what I've been saying. You want your content to be in the upper right hand quadrant: Convenient, accessible, colorful, readable. 

Start with, what is the best media window in your reader's day to engage with your content? Is your idea best delivered as a business-to-business publication, a mobile app, an email newsletter, a podcast, a tablet feed, maybe mobile alerts? Or should you think about a portfolio strategy?

Your audience uses many information devices during the day. Mobile in the morning and all day long. Smartphone or tablet on the train or bus. Laptop or tablet in meetings and at lunch. And always, mobile during dinner. You need to make sure to leverage this information, to truly engage your audience with your important stories and content. So then, what do you need to know about your audience's information use?

Consider the top three markets for smartphones. In China a Google survey estimates that half of all urban Chinese use smartphones. People use them during often lengthly commutes for checking on news, participating in social media. And reading email. Now this is content prime time for this audience. This is the media window you want to hit. India is rapidly converting to smartphones. Projections are that 100 million smartphones will be sold in India over the next three years. And in the US, nearly two thirds of adults already use smartphones.

So then how do you think about the best points of contact with the content you're providing? You want to list and then prioritize all of the connections your audience finds useful.

Does your audience want your information on multiple platforms? Would your readers appreciate email alerts, mobile updates? Perhaps documents or media they can download from the cloud. You need to ask yourself, does your strategy differentiate your content? Are your points of contact the most convenient for your audience? Understanding your audience and how they take in information is the key.

## 3.7: Best Practices for Professional Writing

The prime rule says internationally known authors Stephen King is write a lot and read a lot. Sound simple?
It's effective. When King was asked what he reads, he answered everything I can get my hands on. King offers lots of good advice in his memoir on writing.

So be like Stephen King, read every day, feed your ear. Don't limit yourself to business documents and news publications. Read good writing of various kinds. Consume fine craft. Your vocabulary will improve as you read. Your writing will become more fluid. It's true what they say about what it takes to perform on a great stage. you gotta practice, and practice, and practice some more. Write often. Like any other skill, with attention and hard work, writing improves.

Be direct and clear. You want busy people to pay attention to you and read what you are working so hard to write. Get to the point. Just tell me. Don't adopt a different vocabulary or tone or voice when you write. Do not overwrite, William Strunk advised us 95 years ago in the Elements of Style. Just tell me what you want to say. Tell a story the way you would tell it to your friend or a colleague. You always know how to tell a story to someone you know.

As best-selling novelist Elmore Leonard made a really important point. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip. Use active sentences, not passive. Most of us talk this way in normal conversation. Someone did something, someone said something, someone felt something. The active voice sweeps up the reader and takes her along for the ride. The passive voice just buries the momentum under a rock.

Write with nouns and verbs, Strunk said. Use adjectives and adverbs sparingly. Eliminate unnecessary language, or as Strunk said 95 years ago, omit needless words. Keep it simple. Focus on one idea per sentence.\ Make your content easy to consume. Voltaire put it this way: the best way to be boring is to leave nothing out.

Write for scannability. Everything should work to welcome the reader. Headlines, captions, pull quotes, every word on the page or screen should enhance the reader's experience. Whether the content is in a newspaper or a magazine, On the website, a tablet, or a phone, readers will first scan then zero in on what catches their interest.

Invite action. In internal documents, keep recommendations crisp and to the point. On the web, provide searchable data, links to useful information, social media links.

Revise. The first draft is rarely the best. Writing is mostly about editing. Author James Michener noted, I'm not a very good writer, but I'm an excellent rewriter. The reader benefits from all of that work. What is written without effort is, in general, read without pleasure, said Samuel Johnson.

And know when to violate these rules. The best writers can use descriptive language to illuminate elegantly. Writers who follow these rules still manage to speak in distinctive voices, but when strain from these norms, know why and be sure your method is effective. Mark Twain put it in his classic way, when you catch an adjective kill it. No, I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them. Then the rest will be valuable.

## 3.8 - Use a Story Arc with Content

Whether the work is a business analysis a novel or a long forum magazine feature, it usually has a shape like a small heel. 

In the beginning a business report might state the problem being examined, during which the story begins to gain momentum. Then there's the middle, the history and analysis section during which the story moves smoothly through the chronology, description or other structure of the piece. In the end, the work will gain speed as it approaches a conclusion.

When you are writing a long piece, finish your first draft before stopping to revise it. If you stop part way through the piece you will often loose your way. Your pacing will suffer. You may start to write about details you'll just have to remove later. 

You will lose your focus, and sometimes you lose your control of the piece. The truth is that, as you become a more experienced writer and take on more challenging tasks, you're able to write longer and more complex reports or stories without a lot of pausing and reorienting.

The great novelist William Faulkner said something terrific about this moment, when a writer stops to tinker and then loses momentum. He said, when my horse is running good, I don't stop to give him sugar. You will know better than to stop your story and give it sugar.

Author Ian Banks said about this process, writing is like everything else, the more you do it, the better you get. Don't try to perfect as you go along. Just get to the end of the damn thing. Accept imperfections. Get it finished, and then you can go back. If you try to polish every sentence along the way, there's a chance you'll never get passed the first chapter.

And after all, you know the job of the opening section. Depending on the nature of the work, it is to state the problem and suggest the motive examination. Or to state the question being answered, or the problem to be analyzed.

Don't allow yourself to become bogged down polishing the opening of your project. If you do, the rest of the project, which it probably organized itself in your head, will begin to unravel.

Every writer, myself included, has had the experience of launching a big piece with all the zest and confidence in the world, and then feeling it begin to go off the rails as distractions hampered our progress. Sometimes, you just can't get it back. You have to start over.

One of my mentors, who wrote more major stories than anybody else at the magazine where I worked, was so adept at structure and speed, that he told me sometimes he would just skip the first section entirely, so that he could speedily get the rest of it down on paper.

He had it in his head. He needed to capture it on paper. Now, I'm not advising you to do that, at least not until you're much more experienced than I am. Get the story, the book, the white paper, report, or study, down in the first draft before you go back to revise it. Once you know what it looks like, you can analysis its flaws, polish its gems, and rewrite at will.

I find that if I read it aloud it's a powerful tool. You must read your work aloud. You will hear what's wrong with it. What's missing, what needs to be cut. You may not want to do this in a cubicle with 47 other people listening, but often you can do it there very quietly, or go out in the hallway, or go outside, or do it in the privacy of your home, but do it. You will reap the benefits from the first time you try it. It's like having a terrific editor. You can hear the holes in the piece, the false notes, the rambling that needs to be trimmed.

Revise. The best draft is never the first one. Almost a hundred years ago, a writer named Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, gave writers everywhere some very tough-minded advice. He said, whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it, wholeheartedly and then delete it before sending your manuscripts to press. Murder your darlings.

That phrase, murder your darlings, morphed over the years to kill your darlings. This is a phrase familiar to generations of professional writers. Revising, after all, is about brutal honesty.

Those three paragraphs may have taken you half a day to write, and you may find them absolutely stunning, but they've got to go. Revising can be painful. So is working out in a gym for three hours per day and going without food and water. Stephen King maintains that only brutal cutting and revising can produce the sound finished draft you are capable of producing.

Lillian Hellman said, nothing you write, if you hope to be any good, will ever come out as you first hoped. At least in the first draft. Yes, it can be painful and tedious. No, even the best writers have to revise and revise. Johann Sebastian Bach said, analysis, reflection, much writing, ceaseless correction, there is all my secret.
