## Focused vs. Diffuse Thinking

- Modes of thinking: focused and diffused.
- Diffuse thinking: Relaxed thinking style.
- Focused mode: If you're familiar with something, you hit your old neural pathways.
- If you haven't thought the thought you are trying to learn, then how would you think about it?
- To get to the pattern you want to think about, try to think about things broadly. You can make new neural connections by not thinking about things too tightly.
- You can't be both focused and diffused.

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

- Salvador Dali--technique was relaxing in a chair, holding a key, and letting the key fall when he slept, and it would wake him up, after which he can paint his stuff.
- Thomas Edison--sitting in his chair with the ball bearings, waking him up also.
- Similar to how you lift weights gradually to build musculature, you do a little work every day to build you neuro-scaffold.

#### Summary

- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning.
- Focused and diffused modes.
- Learning something difficult takes time.

## What is Learning?

- The brain weighs 3 lbs but it consumes 10 times more energy by weight than the rest of the body. It is the most complex device in the known universe.
- Seeing, hearing, reaching, running, are beyond the capability of the world's fastest digital computers.
- Brain influences: thought processes, memory, emotions, motivation.
- Default mode network: parts of the brain active when resting.
- There are a million billion synapses in the brain.
- Brain connectivity is dynamic, even if it is mature.
- How do memories stay stable even after so many years? New synapses actually get formed, they don't replace the old ones (?).
- Learning changes the structure of the brain. You are not the same person after a night's sleep or after a nap. You get a better brain!
- Shakespeare: Sleep knits the fabric of your thoughts.

#### A Procrastination Preview

- Pomodoro technique.

#### Practice Makes Permanent

- Why is Math/Science hard? It's because things like cow can be seen. For math, there are no things like 1, 2, +, etc. Even words like love, zest, hope are abstract but they are emotions that we can feel. This is why you have to practice math things.
- The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice. Even if concepts are abstract, your practice is not. Practicing something deepens a neural pattern. Study things hard by focusing them intently. Take a break and let your brain go to diffuse mode. Learn a little everyday, do not cram since the mental foundation won't be as stable as it is supposed to be.

#### Introduction to Memory

- Long term memory/working memory.
- Not 7, but 4 is the number of chunks that we can hold.
- Need to repeat things a lot to get working memory to work.
- Different kinds of long term memory are stored in different parts of the brain.
- Long term memories are important because that's where you store techniques. You want to move things from the working memory to long term memory.
- *Spaced repetition*: Repeat things over a number of days. Same as building the brick wall, you need time to get the synaptic connections to form.

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

- When you sleep, your brain cells shrink/increase space between brain cells. This is your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy.
- Too little sleep leads to headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes, and just plain dying earlier.
- During sleep, your brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning.
- The deactivation of the conscious you helps other areas of your brain to talk more easily to one another. But do focused mode work first.
- *If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it.* If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material, it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it still further.

#### Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

- I believe in learning by doing, and learning by osmosis from people who are experts.
- There isn't a simple way to keep yourself attending something that you're not interested in.
- I can ask a question to the speaker. This can sometimes give rise to a discussion that is more interesting. You learn more by active engagement.
- Jogging/exercise is a wonderful way to get the mind disengaged from the normal train of thought. The problem is remembering all of those ideas. This is why I take a little notebook with me so I can remember what it is what I was thinking about.
- I enjoy the evenings when the hubbub of the day quiets down, and I get a chance to get into a more reflective mode, and that's when I actually get my best work done.
- Multitasking is being to be able to switch back/forth and context switching. I can switch back and forth. It is an enormously productive environment that I am in.
- All the neurons that you have in your brain, you had at birth. Some neurons die, causing the shrinkage of your cortex.
- If you have an animal and if you give it an enriched environment, the strength of the connections between neurons is much stronger there, it can be made by a factor or two.
- Exercise will also increase the number of neurons being born and survive. My brain is helping me remember things because I have new neurons being born, and surviving in my hippocampus.
- Your brain needs pause/using muscles instead of brain to process your information and get the neurons working on it. We need to have our children out there running around.
- Being in a creative environment, where other people are creative is a way of enhancing your own creativity.
- *The image that we have of the creative thinking being isolated may be true of some people, but its not true of me.* Having people to bounce my ideas off of is a very important part of doing science.
- You can become a better test taker. Don't hung up if you can't answer a question. The answer to the problem may pop into your brain later in the test.
- Having youth around is a great way to keep yourself youthful.
- *Success isn't necessarily come by being smart. Passion and persistence. A lot of success in life is that passion and persistence, staying, working on it, and not letting go. This is the most important quality that I see in students that I work with who are successful.*
- Francis Crick's brain is huge!
