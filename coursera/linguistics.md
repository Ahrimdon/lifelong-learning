### Human Language and Animal Communication Systems

- Difference between human and animals:
  - Discrete infinity. The alphabet is limited (26 characters for English), but you can make infinite number of words/sentences. Apes have a discrete set systems of goals, but they cannot combine.
  - Displacement. We can talk about things in the past, on the moon, or even completely abstract things. Bees: Can communicate about space, but it's limited. They can only talk about honey they have seen.
  - Joint attention/shared intentionality. Humans work together as a team. We have to read each others minds a little bit. Some apes have joint attention, but they don't work together in this very complicated way in which humans can do so.

### Human Language Vs Other "Languages"

- What's different between languages and "languages", like computer languages?
  - Human languages have native speakers. They learn about the thing when they are infants.
  - One can speak about basically everything in it.
  - It is carried and recognized by a more or less well-defined group of human beings as their language.
  - Sign language falls under this. There are different sign languages. They have the same functionality, there are native speakers.
- People without language:
  - "Wolf children": Grew up without parents or language.
  - Physical/psychological abuse, the girl who was locked up when she was 20 months old until the age of 13. No interaction, except her dad barked at her like a dog. She was not able to figure out this system of combining all these words into infinitely many sentences.
  - Aphasia: the (partial) loss of language abilities as a result of brain language.
- So how old is language?
  - Since language is abstract, we can't reconstruct language of 50K or 100K years ago.
  - **Continuity-based theories:** languages are based on animal communication.
  - **Discontinuity theories:** something happened to make human language possible.

### Discussion with Marten and Inge: Language Diversity

- Language is a communication system.
- Every generation has to learn a language, and language is complicated. So when children learn languages, they do so differently.
- Was there one ancestor language? We know for sure that we came from East Africa. So it's probable that the language spoken there was the ancestor language of everyone.
- Do constructed languages (Elvish, etc.) qualify as language?
  - They are usually produced by linguists.
  - No, because there are no native speakers. There are no infants that learn these languages, but if for some reason some adult spoke Elvish to their kids, it could be worth studying. But there's no community for Elvish? Haha.

### Language Diversity and Ethnologue

- About 6K-7K languages in the world.
- Some possible differences:
  - Number of vowel sounds.
  - Information in one word (Turkish) or short words (Vietnamese).
  - Terms that exist for one language but nor for the other.
  - Genders.
- Language families:
  - Things like sister languages. French/Italian (Romance), German/English (Germanic).
  - Romance/Germanic fall under the same language family (Indo-European).
  - Other families: Dravidian (S Asia, ex: Tamil), Niger-Congo (sub-Saharan Africa, ex: Swahili).
  - Languages with no relation: Basque.
- Why can languages be so similar?
  - Reasons of contact. Spoken in the same area, and people borrow words from each other. Ex: "Internet", because many words are in contact with English.
  - All human languages have a similar scheme because they're all spoken by humans.

### Discussion with Marten and Inge: What do Linguists Do?

- Library, studying old languages lol.
- Bush, like exploring.
- Closet,
- Laboratory, like for brain waves?
- Street, studying the way in which language is used in everyday life.
