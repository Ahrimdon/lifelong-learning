## 1 - 1 - Philosophy, Modernity, and Intellectual History, part 1 of 2 (14_18)

Today we're going to, let's talk about The Enlightenment. I'm going to do so by looking at a German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, writing in the second half of the 1700s really when there was no Germany yet. I think that's important for everybody to remember. That German speaking Europe is a whole bunch of principalities with some strong big states like Prussia, Austria, Bavaria. But there's no unified Germany yet. And Kant is writing this text, which we've assigned for the course, WWhat is Enlightenment?," as his attempt to articulate why the progress, in education progress, in knowledge progress, in thinking is not only good for individuals, but will it have a salutary effect on society. 

Lots of the leaders of these societies were very worried about enlightenment because they thought as people became more educated, as people became more independent, they might actually not want to be subjects to kings anymore, or subjects to aristocrats. And so, Kant on the one hand is saying, enlightenment is really important. It's something we need to extenuate, emphasize to, to energize. On the other hand he wants to say, don't worry about it. If you're, if you're member of the elite, you have nothing to fear from enlightenment because enlightenment in the end can be a powerful ingredient in the increase of power for the whole state, for the whole society. 

These two magically, powerful thinkers in the middle of the 1700s, late 1700s Rousseau and Kant. So 1784 is when Kant writes.

What is Enlightenment? What happens, what's the big event in the 1780s? Alright. French, French Revolution. When is the French Revolution? 1789. 1789. Okay, there we go. That's a date that we all should know. Think, think, think. That's going to be very helpful to us, alright? This is a Euro, we're very kind of, Euro snobs in this class. So 1776, okay. 1789, that's really an important date for us. So, what we're doing is reading two texts here or three really, prior to the French Revolution, which changes the world of culture, dramatically, and politics, and economics. As does 1776, but that's a different course. 

So What is Enlightenment? is, as I said, a small text of Kant's. It's even a work of journalism. Today, we, we need to understand a little bit about the philosophical context that Kant operated in. In some ways, the intellectual context of the 18th century, to which he is responding. May be I should say a word about enlightenment from our perspective at least from, I should say, my perspective as your professor. 

There are lots of definitions of enlightenment. Here is one I think that you can find useful for the, for the duration of this course, and perhaps even beyond. And that is enlightenment is the project to make the world more of a home for human beings. __Enlightenment is a project to make the world more of a home for human beings through the use of reason.__ Through the use of reason. That's really important because making the world more of a home for us, that is reducing its dangers, bringing out its potential through the use of reason, is going to demand science, is going to demand education, and is going to demand certain call for freedom that will allow people to transform the world to make it more hospitable for human beings. 

The enlightenment also though is a social movement. It is not just a bunch of big shot philosophers talking about big ideas, it's a whole range of writers who take Voltaire's injunction to _ecrasez l'infame_ which really means, well it means, squash out infamy. But it, it, it means, get rid of all the nonsense. Get rid of all the bologna getting in the way of progress. And for many journalists, for many small time intellectuals, we could call them, this just means that showing that people who are already full of themselves, people who have power and prestige, and a certain kind of snob appeal, that those people are just nonsense and we have to get rid of them. We have to show that we can do better than that. 

So, the enlightenment is a philosophical side, and then there's this kind of journalistic, social movement side. Kant is responding to both of those things in this essay. 

Kant describes himself as steering a middle course for philosophy. What did that mean? __It meant for Kant that he would defend reason, defend science, defend this new form of enlightenment. But also he said, he would make room for faith, make room for belief.__ He wanted to have his cake and eat it too, if we can use that expression. History of philosophy from Plato to Kant is consumed with the problem of how do you, how do you connect the ideal and the real? For Plato it was the ideal forms, the ideas, sometimes you call them, how are they related to the real. In Kant's time, that question took the form of a battle about skepticism. 

And I want to give you a little bit of background about that before we go into more into Kant proper. The mona pre, the battle skepticism can be framed beginning with Descartes. Rene Descartes, who wrote famously on the discourse on the method a sentence that everybody who study a little philosophy should remember. And that is, I think, therefore I am, this is Descartes. I think, therefore I am. What did he mean by that? __He meant that, he could doubt everything around him. He could doubt that this was really a book case, he could doubt that he was really in the room now that I am talking to you. These are could doubt because maybe I am dreaming. But one thing I cannot doubt, Descartes said, is that I am doubting. And doubting, for Descartes, is a form of thinking. So, this becomes the bedrock for Descartes.__ I think, therefore I am. So for Descartes, you can keep skepticism at bay. Keep skepticism at bay by the certainty of your own subjective thinking existence, doubting existence.

And on the basis of that clear certainty of my, of one's own existence, you build up other clear and distinct ideas. This is what he called the kind of bedrock of thinking on which you can then build secure notions of science, of calculation. Especially of mathematics, of optics. And you can keep skepticism at bay because you are building on something secure. 

Clear and distinct rational ideas that must be true because they are part of the apparatus of our thinking, the logic of, of our minds. So, that's Descartes on one side. 

On the other side, you have Locke in the English Enlightenment, if I can use this shorthand. He didn't say I feel, therefore I am, but he should have said that I guess. In other words, Locke thought what we get knowledge not by closing our eyes and thinking really hard about what must be true. __For Locke, we get our knowledge by, through experience. We want to know if this is real, we tap on it enough, we tap on it enough our hand starts hurting, gosh that's real.__ We want, we, we, we get our knowledge by more and more sensation, by more and more experience, by more and more experiments. And so for Locke, the way you keep skepticism at bay is by piling up experience. Experience leading to knowledge. 

Now David Hume came along and close to Kant's time. __And argued that, well, experience didn't really give you knowledge. It really just gave you habit.__ It just gave you customs that you got used to. So, I get used to this being hard. And that's all it is. It's just a custom. It's just a habit. It's not something with a foundation. And that's a new kind of almost we can call imperasist skepticism that really worried Kant. 

So when Kant was writing his major philosophical works, he was trying, he said, to steer a course between the rationalism of Descartes and the empiricism of Locke and Hume to, to actually make a place for clear and distinct ideas that you understand by really thinking hard, and also experience that you get from being out in the world and registering yours, these sensations. 

Kant said, I need to definitely create boundaries around reason to make room for faith. I need to steer a middle course. And Kant is an awfully complex thinker who wrote, who wrote mammoth works: The Critique of Pure Reason, The Critique of Practical Reason, The Critique of Judgment. These are his great major works, as well as a slew of other important essays, and so we can't go through them all here. And by any means, all I want to give you is one vehicle through which Kant steered this middle course. 

And that's what was his, really his two world theory. That is, for, for Kant, in order to have your cake and eat it, too, in order to have a belief in ideas as well as in experience, __all you had to do was to understand that we have knowledge of one side of the world. He called it the phenomenal side. And we have belief in things in themselves, things that not just as they appear to us but things in themselves, that he called the Noumenal Side.__ 

So, the knowledge piece, the phenomenal piece for Kant was we, through, how we see the world, through what he called our categories of perception. I put my glasses on because for Kant, the world makes sense for us. We have knowledge of the world because our minds are, if you will, our glasses organize the world for us, in space-time categories, in other kinds of categories because __the world makes sense to us because our minds construct the world as a sensible place.__ And then, we could actually understand the world and have rules about it because it's all organized for us, by our space-time glasses if you will. By our minds. Knowledge for Kant comes from our construction of the world as a sensible place. And that means we can make predictions, we can build bridges that don't fall down. We can make clocks that keep the right time.

All of this is about the phenomenal world. And then, some people come along and say, but is that the real world? Is that the deepest world? __And Kant says, well, I can't actually get my glasses off. I can't get, I can't see the world without my mind. But, I know there must be something there when my mind isn't seeing the world. This is the noumenal world.__ The noumenal world. For Kant, that was the world of faith. The world where you believe in the immortality of the soul, your salvation, the love of God, the simple truth at peasants nose, Kant sometimes said. That's the noumenal world, the world of things in themselves. 

__You can't disprove that with science. You can't prove it with science either. It is the world of faith. The noumenal world is the world of faith, and the phenomenal world is the world of science.__ They can coexist, Kant said. I, Kant, have steered a middle course between them. They both are valid. The enlightenment doesn't threaten faith because faith is about things in themselves. And nobody knows that for sure, but you can feel it as deeply as possible in your heart. And the phenomenal world is about things that we can test, things that we can calculate, things that we have organized through our minds, through our, if you will, space-time glasses. So in What is Enlightenment, Kant is writing having already done this philosophical groundwork, if you will. And having done that philosophical groundwork in the enlightenment kind of saying, we must liberate ourselves from immaturity. If you remember in the very beginning of what is enlightenment, __Kant says, enlightenment is man's release from his self incurred tutelage. And he says, dare to know, dare to know. Have the courage to use your own reason. That Kant says is the model of the enlightenment.__ And for Kant, that means the enlightenment provides you with maturity, autonomy, the ability simply to think for yourself. And that for Kant is a precious intellectual and moral ability, moral capacity. Kant says in, in paragraph nine of What is Enlightenment?, the touchstone of everything that can be concluded as a law for a people lies in the question of whether the people could have enclosed such a law on itself."We'll talk about that next time, and I look forward to it.

## 1 - 2 - Philosophy, Modernity, and Intellectual History, part 2 of 2 (9_57)

Kant's Dare to Know leads him to make a political or at least quasi-political statement that he really does borrow from the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as we'll see in subsequent lectures. 

_The touchstone of everything that can be concluded as a law for a people" lies in the question whether the people could have imposed such a law on itself. __A law would be legitimate only if people would impose that law on themselves. That is the core, the foundation of democracy.__ - Kant_ 

That's why democracy is an outgrowth of, of Kant's thinking even though he himself was hardly a democrat because he would have been arrested. and he was a very cautious man. But would people impose the law of themselves? 

That's really important because it shows you two things about Kant. The first thing it shows you that he thinks that people should impose the laws on themselves, that in other words, they shouldn't just follow the law because somebody is making them do it. 

This goes back to Kant's categorical imperative, really. It's, it's not, if you do the right thing because somebody's forcing you to do it, that's no great, big deal. If you do the right thing because you know it's the right thing and you are acting in accordance with a law that you give yourself, that's a good thing. That's a moral thing. 

__In politics, following the law because the policeman is right behind you and, you know, you might get clubbed or something if you don't follow it, that's, that's, that's not a great thing. But if you follow the law because you give that law to yourself, you know it's the right thing to do.__ That's the sign that you are enlightened. and as Rousseau will say, as we'll see later on, that's a sign of your freedom. That you're, you're obeying a law that you give yourself. The other thing to notice about this in Kant is that for Kant, it's really important that you will follow the law. In other words, he doesn't think that when you dare to know and you're independent as a thinker, that you're going to go wild and crazy. That actually, no. __If you're really thinking hard, if you're thinking clearly, you will realize that you want to live in the world where people behave in a certain way.__ They behave according to universal laws that they themselves, they give to themselves. I mean, in simple terms, if you're stopped at a traffic light and there are no police around and there's no one else around. But you don't go through the red light because you decide you want to live in a society where people obey the rules. Then, you're, as Kant is saying, free. And you're enlightened. You're thinking for yourself. You're not just afraid to go through the red light because somebody might catch you, you have decided to live your life in accordance to, with a rule that you have given yourself. 

That is showing that you have entered this path, this path of enlightenment. The middle way for Kant is important, not just in philosophy. Remember, I said that contrast to steer a course between the rationalism of Descartes and the empiricism of Locke and Hume, but he also wants enlightenment to steer a middle course between obedience to the past and some wild revolution. Kant is no wild revolutionary. So, you see in the text that he says, men work themselves gradually out of barbarity if only intentional artifices are not made to hold them in it. 

So, what's intent, in other words, for Kant, again, in the middle course. On the one hand he's saying, don't put artifices in front of people to keep them ignorant. If you take away the obstacles, people will learn. But he also says, they'll learn gradually. __So, if you're an aristocrat or whose afraid that people might learn, Kant is saying get the obstacles out of the way, let them learn. But he's also saying, they will learn gradually. You don't have to worry about them learn.__

Kant, at the end of the essay, makes an appeal to the King Frederick the Great. He makes this appeal and saying to the, to the King and to the King's officials that you don't have to be afraid. As he says, argue as much as you will, about what you will, just obey the rules while you argue. And here is an important thing about Kant, what we call in this slide, the public and private use of reason. Kant says, that, that we in our private use of reason, when it is in our capacity where we are obeying an official above us. an officer of the state of the army, somebody who is our boss. And as he calls out our private use of reason, we actually can be limited. We we have to, we have to obey the people who give us orders. But as in, in our public user reason, that is as scholars who were, were thinking about scientific issues or investigating logical problems. 

As scholars we have to be free to think as we will so that we can make intellectual progress. Again, Kant is steering a middle course, he's telling the officials, don't worry, we will obey you and so far as, we are, have pledged to serve you. If you're my boss, I'm going to obey you. I can think about whether your order is rational, but I will obey you because that is my obligation. But if I write about this in the public sphere, then I should think clearly and logically whether you're right or wrong.

__Again, obedience on the one hand, freedom on the other. this is this is the Kant's typical move.__ He is having two worlds. The noumena, remember that from the early part in the lecture, the things in themselves, and the phenomenal. __You can have noumena, you can have the faith. Things in themselves, phenomenal, you have reason. In politics you have obedience and you have free thinking. You have enlightenment but it's gradual.__ So, Kant is a crucial figure in the enlightenment, crucial figure for modern philosophy because he actually thinks so clearly and logically, but for our purposes, he's also the thinker who says, modernity is here. You have to do something about it. You can't just try to keep modernity at bay. But if you do something about it rationally, if you do something about it prudently, modernity and enlightenment will not break down the order around us, it will not destroy our civilization as we know it. In fact, in the end, it will enhance that civilization. 

So, as we conclude with Kant, I have to remind you that Kant was an extraordinarily complex thinker, and we're just scratching the surface of his thought in, in this lecture and in this course. But for our purposes, I want you to remember this, that Kant strove to steer a middle course in the history of philosophy, that is, he wanted to preserve an ins, a, a concern with the ideal as well as the real. He wanted to make room for faith and have reason limited. He wanted enlightenment, but he wanted it gradual. Remember, we said that __Kant, through his critique of pure reason, established that we have firm knowledge but we have firm knowledge through our space time glasses through our minds of the world we create.__ They have firm knowledge of that but it might not be the world in itself. The phenomenal world of which we have knowledge may, is different from the noumenal world which is what we just believe in with the simple faith, the simple faith of the common peasant or the common person. 

__Kant also said that you should dare to know, dare to know. Use your reason. Don't be immature for your whole life. But he said, when you dare to know and you leave your immaturity, you will do so gradually.__ You'll still obey orders. You'll, you won't wreck the whole society. Enlightenment is something we can encourage but it's not something that will destroy the world as we know it, Kant said, we would really hope. A middle course. He embraced modernity because he didn't think modernity would go too quickly. Next time, we'll see how Jean-Jacques Rousseau who who wrote books that Kant loved and Kant was attracted to, how Jean-Jacques Rousseau takes a much more radical stands. Rousseau was much more harsh in his criticism of modernity. Rousseau was willing to say that modernity was a tremendous mistake and that we had to find a cure for modernity, not a way of encouraging its gradual development. We'll talk about that next time. I look forward to it.

## 2 - 1 - What is Enlightenment-, part 1 of 4 (15-06)

Kant was a big fan of Rousseau's. It's a curious thing because they were so different in temperament. Kant was the kind of guy that had such a regular life that people are said to have set their watches by that, you know, when, when he took his walk every day because he took it at exactly the same time. And the story goes that Kant one day didn't come out for his walk and everybody was shocked, they were worried about him. In his little village and they found out later on that he had received a book by Rousseau that day and he was so engrossed that he couldn't leave his chair. I don't know if that is true but it's a good story. 

Rousseau was an engrossing writer, an emotional writer. a man who wrote about being stirred by his passions, and and he stirred the passions of others as we'll see in the next few lectures. Our first text by Rousseau is called the often the first Discourse, it's the Discourse on, on the Arts and Sciences. And it is a great way to begin with Rousseau. Because it shows, what, most important thing for us in this course about John Jaques Rousseau, which is that he is the, the conscience of the enlightenment. Bad conscience of the enlightenment. He understand everything there is to understand about the enlightenment and he rejects it. He participates in the enlightenment and he turns against it. Rousseau is a thinker of, of radical contrasts, not trying steer a middle course. Not trying to steer a middle course like Conte but trying to dig to the bottom, and then often with extreme, extreme implications.

I, I, I wanted to just read you a little bit of, of, from Rousseau's confessions about How he decided, to write the First Discourse. He says, 

_One day I took the Mercure de France, and, that's a newspaper, and glancing through it as I walked, I came upon this question propounded, propounded by the Dijon Academy for the next year's prize. Here's the question, Has the progress of the sciences and arts done more to corrupt morals, or to improve them. The moment I read this, I beheld another universe, Rousseau wrote. And became another man. When I reached Vansend/g, he was going to Vansend to visit his sometimes friend Diderot, when I reached Vansend I was in a state of agitation bordering on delirium._

Rousseau says later that he was lost after he took this step because he became then a writer. He became a man of reflection and that, that for Rousseau means that he, he was no longer a natural man. We'll come back to that in subsequent lectures. But Rousseau is this, person of enthusiasms a person who embraces passion. even as he writes about the distortion. Of the passions.

So let's talk a little bit about the first discourse, today. The discourse on, the arts and sciences. Have the arts and sciences contributed to morals? Rousseau knew that everyone expected folks to write in and say oh, the arts and sciences they're doing great and they're helping us progress. They're helping us like the world better, be more at home in the world. As we've said that's what enlightenment is. Arts and sciences, what could be bad. [LAUGH] And Rousseau say's quite the opposite. Very early in the discourse he says, while the government and the laws See to the safety and the well being of men assembled. The sciences, letters, and arts. Less despotic, and perhaps, more powerful. The sciences, and arts, and letters spread garlands of flowers over the iron chains with which they are laden. __The arts and sciences throttle our original freedom for which we seem born and they make us love our slavery. This is how they fashion us, Rousseau says, into civilized peoples.__

So here you have Rousseaus opening salvo. __The arts and sciences cover up our oppression, that's what they They do. They disguise our oppression. They make us forget that we're not free. Even worse, they make us love our slavery, Roseaux says.__ The arts and sciences, don't promote knowledge and understanding, they promote tyranny and inequality. This is the argument of Rousseau's first discourse.

So, I never missed a class. I was so proud of this, cause I, and I loved school. I loved school. Here I am, I'm still in the same place, I love it. And I told my daughter one day, she was saying something, you know, I never missed a class and she said, Daddy, you weren't at college, you were in class. You, all you had was a classroom experience. You never had the real college experience. You, nerd. Your brother, Uncle Rick, he had a great time. He has friends from college. They still go out and party. You want to go to like, continuing education. I see a book because I really like that. And she said to me, make you love your slavery. They did a good job on you daddy.

How did they do that? __In a word, Rousseau says, the arts and science do this. They they create a disguise for our oppression. Because the arts and sciences create new needs. Create new forms of dependence.__ Take a look at the footnote on five in the discourse on the arts and sciences. He writes, princes know that all needs which a people impose on itself are so many chains. Which it assumes. What yoke, Roseaux writes, could be imposed on men who need nothing. What yoke could be imposed on men who need nothing? So Roseaux's problem with the Arts and Sciences, is that they are luxurious, they have become luxuries. And as luxuries, they promote in us, new forms of dependence. We don't, need them to begin with, but once we have the Arts and Sciences, and if we're, then are deprived of them at some point, we feel pain, we feel we're missing something. 

And for Roseaux, this creation of new needs, new vulnerability, New dependencies is a form of degradation, not progress. Arts and science modernity, enlightenment as forms of degradation and corruption. From the first discourse again, what conclusion is to be drawn, what conclusion is to be drawn. From this paradox so worthy of being born in our time; and what will become of virtue when one has to get rich at all costs? The ancient political thinkers, Rosseau wrote, here's our key sentence. __The ancient political thinkers forever spoke of morals and virtue; ours speak only of commerce. And money. So Rousseau's criticism of enlightenment and the arts and sciences become criticism of luxury.__

And then they become a criticism of the economic relationships of his time, Remember in Rousseau's writing in 18th century France, the three estates, The clergy, the aristocracy, and then the peasants. The peasants making up, and the middle class, really, in that third estate, making up the vast majority of the population. A whole system built on inequality.

And what Rousseau is saying in the first discourse, is that the arts and sciences end the Enlightenment, by implication actually disguise this inequality. Making us suffer more from it, because we don't see it clearly. __So Rousseau goes back in the first discourse to talk about, human beings prior to their corruption by the arts and the sciences. and he, he writes that in those good old days, in those good old days we were simpler. We were content to be more honest with one another.__ Because we didn't have all of these disguises, to deceive ourselves, and our fellow man.

In paragraph 53, in paragraph 53, Rousseau writes about this relationship of learning and luxury. I quote from him again. What gives rise to all of these abuses, Rousseau writes, if not the fatal inequality introduced among men By the distinction of talents, and the disparagement of the virtues. This is the most obvious effect, the most obvious effect, of all of our studies. And the most dangerous in its consequences. The most dangerous in its consequences. Because what happens, Rousseau says. 

__When you have Enlightenment, you have the arts and sciences making so called progress. Is, you get some people who seem to be really smart, and other people who aren't so smart. You begin to get some people who look up to the writer, the philosopher, the scientist. And say, oh, I wish I could be like that. And for Rousseau, at that moment, you have introduced a whole form of corruption.__ That it's going to be a slippery slope for human beings because they will try to be someone they are not. They will try to be someone they are not and for Rousseau that is a form of dishonesty. And he says writers get into this mode all the time. Scientists thinkers get into this mode all the time. They are performing for someone else. They are creating luxuries introducing inequality, and under the guise of promoting knowledge they are promoting a kind of dishonesty we might call today inauthenticity. They are not being themselves. 

So Rousseau's first discourse A radical text in enlightenment because he's not defending the status quo and I think this is really important and I want to make sure I get this clear to you because __there are plenty of people in the 18th century who don't like the enlightenment, they say, we don't want the people to learn.__ We don't want the people to be educated. They can't handle it. They can't handle the truth. So they, we want to, we want ourselves to keep the power because we're so good. We're the aristocrats we're the monarchies officers. We're, we're the rich and powerful. We deserve our powers and our privileges they say. The enlightenment is too dangerous they say. Or they say we can't have the enlightenment because the enlightenment is eroding faith. And we want more religion. We want more faith. We want more belief. We don't want questioning they say. These are enemies of the enlightenment.

And that Rousseau comes along and he's an enemy of the enlightenment but he his not conservative like those other folks. He does not want to preserve the status quo. He isn't saying the enlightenment's not radical enough [LAUGH]. __The enlightenment's not radical enough, Rosseau is saying.__ The enlightenment is actually disguising oppression under the guise of offering us more freedom and autonomy. __So what we're so saying is you guys in the enlightenment think you're actually disturbing the status quo, but you are promoting the most important ingredient in the status quo, which is inequality. The taste for luxury. The demand for, for distinction which leads to inauthenticity and dishonesty. This, he says, is the slippery slope of modernity.__ We're getting further and further away from who we naturally should be, who we are by nature.

Now, we get to the, the last section of the first discourse, which is such a surprise. It really as you read this you hear all this radical talk. About the corruption through modernity and the slippery slope of enlightenment. You get to the end of the first discourse and his recommendation is really is, is, is, is really a surprise. That is, in the end, he says let learned men of the first rank find honorable asylum in the courts of kings. Learned men of the first rank should be brought in to the political establishment. He's just told us why inequality is so bad, how we have to slippery slope of enlightenment. __In the end, what he says is the cure. I actually have to give the smart people power.__ Why does he say that? Well, you could be skeptical and say, well, because he wants a job, right? He wants to get into the the mix. I don't think that's accurate. and it's certainly not generous. 

What Rousseau is saying at the end, is something that we will be consistent about as we'll see in his other discourses. Which is, you can't go backwards, you can't go back to where you were before. __You can't strip off your enlightenment and go backwards. So this is the diasese, the cure, is to use learned men, to try to institute political change. That would at least be less dishonest than having learned men on the outside of power just making fun of the people with power but not actually doing anything about it.__ Bring power and education together, Rosseau was saying. That's the best hope we can, we have. But I want to emphasise this that is that, that, that Rousseau is a diagnostician more than he is a a, a physician who treats something. He diagnoses the problem, that is what his contribution is most centrally. In this text the last part seems less satisfying at least to me than the diagnosis. The treatment is given very quickly. and, and it's, it's not sketched out very much at all. It's not his job. What his job was, was to show you what you think you were so proud of, what you think was so great about modernity, what you think was so great about education is actually making us worse. That's his warning. That's his critique. That's a lot. And we should be grateful for it, I think.

## 2 - 2 - What is Enlightenment-, part 2 of 4 (15-16)

So today, we're going to go onto Rousseau's second discourse, the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality. you'll see that this is a, a more political work. a work in which Rousseau sketches out the origins of political society.

He says, "For all the rest of the day, wandering deep into the forest, I sought and I found the vision of those primitive times, the history of which I proudly traced." I, Rousseau, I demolish the petty lies of mankind. I dare to strip man's nature naked to follow the progress of time and trace the things which have distorted it. And by comparing man as he had made himself with man as he is by nature I showed him in his pretended perfection, to the true source of his misery. That's the key. I showed him in his pretended perfection, progress the true source of his misery. Exalted by these sublime meditations my soul soared toward Divinity. And from whose height I looked down on my fellow men, pursuing their blind path of their prejudice, as there are errors in there, misfortunes, and there are crimes. I cried to them, he says, in a voice they could not hear. Madmen who ceaselessly complain of nature. learn that all your misfortunes, all your misfortunes arise from yourselves. Madmen, don't blame nature,. It is your cells, your distance from nature, your corruption of nature, which is your problem."

This is the beginning of the second discourse. That was just how Rousseau described. Writing a second discourse in his confessions. You can't have coherent thinking without an idea of nature cuz you need nature to do something. You need, the idea of nature does work. And everyone who says, Rousseau, the Rousseauians claim everyone who says they no longer have a concept of nature, they're beyond that, they've troubled it, they've critiqued it, they've dialectically negated it. All of them are hypocritical or just not very smart from the Rousseau perspective. They have an idea of nature, they just don't want to show what it is. Because without an idea of nature, you can't have a place from which to critique the things that are your enemies. Tour, the things you don't like. This is the Rousseauian view. Without some, place from which you criticize You have no, leverage for critique. So, you can for example, and this is very much in Rousseau's mind, you can't have an idea of corruption. Unless you have an idea of nature. So if you say this politician in Chicago is corrupt, and someone says to you oh, my God you have never been to Chicago. That's like saying the sun is hot. What you're saying is that it is natural in Chicago for politicians to be corrupt, right? That it's just what people do in Chicago. That's the nature of the Chicago politics. In Rosseau's preface to his Second Discourse, the On the Origins of Inequality, he says there is, I sense, an age at which the individual human being Would want to stop. You will seek the age at which you wish your species had stopped. And what he means by that is the good parts of our nature have begun to flower but the evils parts have not yet found development or the corruption has not yet set in. And he says when we look at that period. When we are on the cusp of corruption but not yet there, in other words we have begun to show our potential for good but not for evil, he says "This sentiment that arises must serve as praise of your first ancestors." The criticism of your contemporaries, and the dread of those who will have the misfortune to come after you. I'm paraphrasing, I think, at the end there. so, it, it is meant, Russo's picture of the natural, of this point in our history and when there was a balance in our lives, that is meant as a criticism of the present and a warning about the future. Rousseau says early on in the second discourse that there are two principles prior to reason. One is interest in self-preservation And the second is the natural repugnance at seeing another sentient being suffer. And now the interest in self preservation's pretty clear. When in danger, we wanna, we wanna take care of ourselves. You know, so if we see a scary thing we flee. or if we have to, we fight. But Rousseau thinks most of the time we can escape. we can hide, w can get away. We try to take care of ourselves, we try, to keep ourselves alive. The second one, the most interesting perhaps is because the natural repugnance at seeing ascension being suffer. He talks about how an animal, if it passes another animal who is dying on the road or in the woods. we'll kind of shy away, right, we'll move away cuz it, it's, it's natural a version to see any other creature with feelings, suffer. And that second piece is going to be very important for Rousseau. it's really the, at the core of where morality comes from. not wanting to see another hu-, another sentient being, not a human being necessarily but any, Any creature with feelings to see that creature suffer. Rousseau gets off some barbs against his fellow intellectuals early on in the second discourse. He writes, most of our ills are of our own making. We would get rid of most of all of them if we would retain the simple, uniform and solitary way of life described to us by nature. If it is de, destined for us to be healthy Then, I almost dare assert, here is the barb, the state of reflection is a state against nature. The state of reflection is a state of, against nature. And the man who meditates, Rousseau writes, the man who meditates is a depraved animal. Animal, and some of his friendly actually thought that he was thinking about them when he wrote that, and of course readers for the last couple hundred years or so said, well Rosseau himself then would fall into that category. And the answer is, of course, he knows he's a person who meditates. He doesn't think he's pure. He doesn't think he's living the natural life. He is a person of reflection, but his re flection is meant to move him away From this pursuit of progress which is in fact resultant pursuit of perversion or corruption. Resource picture of early human beings is one where human beings are much closer to other animals then they are when we get civilized. Here is a picture of, of sexual moray. This, is one where promiscuity arranged because there is no sense of ongoing connection, no sense of monogamy or anything of that kind. He says in the primitive state Everyone bedded down at random and often for only a single night. When I'm teaching this class, at a university, a residential university this always gets a lot of giggles, as it seems to describe college life. Everyone bedded down at random, and often for only a single night. Males and females united fortuitously, Rousseau writes, according to chance encounters, opportunity and desire, without speech being an especially necessary interpreter of what they had to tell one other. Isn't that nicely put? Without speech being an especially necessary interpreter of what they had to tell one other; they parted just as readily. They parted just as readily. I'm reading, I should remind you, from the. A translation by Victor Gourevitch which is probably, may be different from the one you find online. so in those early days, we're pre-family, we're pre-romantic attachments and You, we're really pre-social attached, where people encounter fortuitously and then they go on their way, they go on their way. but there is in even in these early days that notion of the aversion of seeing another. a creature suffer, that leads to what we so called compassion sometimes he calls it pity he says pity a disposition suited to being as weak and subject to as so many ills as we are. A virtue all the more universal and useful as is precedes of all reflection in him. In him. So the natural beast themselves sometimes show evident signs of it, of pity that is. This is very important because for Rousseau, pity precedes reflection. We don't care about somebody else's suffering becaus e we think about it. We care about it because of an intinctual, an instinctive. Natural reaction and pity compassion or, or, or is not dependent on, on our appreciation of the status of the other who's, who's suffering. We feel just naturally that fact that they suffer is all we need to know. The fact that they are in pain is all we need to care about in order for that instinct, that natural feeling of pity to kick in. Why is this so important? Why is he talking about this in an essay on the origins of inequality? Because it's inequality that makes us more and more strangers to one another. It's inequality that creates a dynamic That's not based in self preservation and compassion. it's inequality that actually creates a dynamic of further and further separation of human beings from one to the other and also, increases our, satisfaction at seeing other people suffer. That's the great perversion that goes along with inequality and we'll get to that in a few minutes. That is, that with, inequality, we feel if we have more stuff, we feel superior because we see other people who suffer. Are own pleasure is augmented by the difference we have from those who are poorer than we are. We'll get to that in a minute, but that's why Rousseau is linking pity, this natural instinct, to inequality because inequality reduces the opportunities for compassion and increases the opportunities for the infliction of pain. Inequality, Rousseau underscores. is depe, increased by society. In the woods, in the forests, in the nuh, state of nature when we, we're, we're are all not the same, but we don't compare ourselves one to the other. That's so important for Rousseau. When you just run away from people. You climb a tree and hide. Or you do something so you're not constantly in comparison. You are not measuring yourself against another, you are off to the next encounter. Only when you are in society when people start looking at each other trying to be someone else for another, act for another, only in such a situation will inequality r eally begin to increase in dynamic fashion. He says that it will be evident how much smaller the difference between man and man must be in the state of nature than in the state of society. And how much natural inequality in the human species must increase as a result of instituted inequality. Notice that. Na, natural inequality in the human species Must increase as a result of instituted inequality. That's really important for me. So, we'd layer on inequalities in, in society. And so, we're Rousseau in, having set off some of these or set out some of these Marker is about, what is a natural human being. What are some of the instinctive components of human beings. This is in Part one. In Part two, he really turns to the origins of society. There is, of course, inequality in the preist society stage. That is, some people are faster than others, some people are taller than others, some people are stronger. But it doesn't matter so much, cuz we don't compare ourselves to one to the other, cuz we're not living in proximity, we don't have relationships. Only in society. Do we create a dynamic of inequality? And so, the first sentence of part two of the discourse is, the first man ha- who, having enclosed a piece of ground, to whon it occurred to say, this is mine, and found people sufficiently simple to believe him, was the true founder of civil society. So the true founder of civil society is the person who creates property. See that? He puts a, a stick in the ground and says, this is mine, and then got other people to recognize that, stupid enough, simple enough to believe him. That is the founder of civil society. Hardly heroic, it's, someone who pulls the wool over others, the eyes of For other people. That's all we have time for today we'll, we'll pick things up next time when we move on, along the syllabus to the next set of readings. See you then.
