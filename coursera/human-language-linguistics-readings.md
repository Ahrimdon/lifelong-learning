## How many languages are there in the world?
[Reference](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/how-many-languages-are-there-world)

- As of 2009, at least a portion of the bible had been translated into 2508 different languages.
- 230 languages in Europe, 2197 in Asia, 832 in Papua New Guinea.
- France: 10 distinct Romance languages.
- 1/4 or the world's languages have fewer than 1K speakers, in the next century 3K languages will be gone.
- Hebrew: died and was reborn.
- When a language dies, a world dies with it, in the sense that a community's connection with its past, its traditions and base of specific knowledge are all lost.
- "A language is a dialect with an army and navy". European "languages" vs African "dialects". Chinese "dialects" are just as different from one another as French/Spanish, they are not mutually intelligible.
- Mutually intelligible: "If speakers of A can understand speakers of B without difficulty, A and B must be the same language". Ex: Bulgarian/Macedonian.
- Dialect continua: A range of dialects spoken across a large geographical area, differing only slightly between areas that are geographically close to each other, and gradually decreasing in mutual intelligibility as the distances become greater. Ex: German and Dutch.
- Ex: Chaucer (1400), Shakespeare (1600), Jefferson (1800) and George W Bush (2000) spoke "English", but English has changed over the years.
- Different speakers of the same language may vary widely in their vocabulary due to factors of education or speaking style.

- Distinct grammars? (What differentiates one grammar from another?)
  - Ex: "She thinks Mary is smart", NO LANGUAGE thinks of the possibility that "She" is "Mary".
  - But in English, we precede nouns with adjectives ("red balloon"), while in France, it's maillot jaune ("yellow jersey").
  - Italian:
    - Standard: "Maria non mangia la carne" = "Maria not eats the meat"
    - Piemonte, Italy: "Maria a mangia nen la carn" = "Maria she eats not the meat").
    - 300-500 possibilities in Northern Italy.

- Human language differs from other communicative behavior of every other known organism in these ways:
  - The system is not stimulus bound and ranges over an infinity of possible distinct messages.
  - It achieves this with a limited, finite system of units that combine hierarchically and recursively into larger units.
- It's so weird that to a person from Kuala Lumpur, Milan/Turin languages are both "Italian", but for a native of Milan, the differences between those speeches are huge.

## How did language begin?
[Reference](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/sites/default/files/LanguageBegin.pdf)

- How did we split from chimpanzees/bonobos re: language?
- Human language:
  - Unlimited number of topics.
  - It can solicit info (questions) and give orders.
  - It contains an expression for negation (no other animal has this).
  - Kids learn the system from hearing others use it.
- Animal systems:
  - Few dozen calls only.
  - Used to communicate immediate issues like food, danger, threat, or reconciliation.
  - Until anatomically modern humans, about 100K years ago, the shape of hominid vocal tracts didn't permit the modern range of speech sounds.
  - Possible that we started off as sign language?
- Some human abilities that can help re language:
  - Memorization (used to learn words).
  - The desire to communicate.
  - The understanding of others' intentions and beliefs.
  - The ability to cooperate.
- Languages evolved in stages.
  - Sounds used to name a wide range of objects/actions.
  - Digitizing signals into sequences of discreet speech sounds (consonants/vowels) rather than unstructured calls.
  - Next, the ability to string 'words' to create a message built out of the meanings of its parts.
  - In two-year-old children, they have a "protolanguage", and in adults, there is "pidgins", or the systems put together when adult speakers of disparate languages need to communicate with each other.
  - Then, the protolanguage would have a richer structure, having plural markers, tense marker, etc.
  - 100K to 50K years ago, something changed, this is when we started finding artifacts. Did they become smarter because of languages (oral history)? Did Neanderthals speak a protolanguage?
- FOXP2: a mutation in this gene has been shown to lead to deficits in language as well as in control of the face and mouth.
  - This gene is slightly altered from apes.

## Can Animals Talk and Use Language Like Humans?
[Reference](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150216-can-any-animals-talk-like-humans)

- Tilda, orangutan at Cologne Zoo, can whistle, clap, smack her lips, deep-throated human-like garbled sounds.
- Animals (parrots, beluga whales, elephants) can mimic human speech. They hear, imitate, and produce them.
- Do they know what those sounds mean?
- There's a part in the forebrain that makes direct connections with the voice muscles in both humans and parrots. These help them learn new sounds, and control their muscles to produce the learned sounds.
- Very divergent animals can do this (humans, bats, elephants, seals, dolphins, whales, parrots, songbirds, hummingbirds).
- Most talking animals are highly social species. In captivity, they only have humans to interact with, so they're trying to bond with them.
- Vocal skills can make them more attractive to the opposite sex.
- Koshik the elephant learned that when "nuo" (Korean word for "lie down") is said, he should lie down. He can say that word. But he does not expect the keepers to lie down when he produces the imitation "nuo".
- It's possible that Australopithecus and the Neanderthals could sort of talk, because Tilda the orangutan can imitate sounds.

## Language Statuses
[Reference](https://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-status)

- Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale.
- 0: International, National, Provincial.
- Wider communication: Used in work/mass media.
- Educational: In use, and taught with an institutionalized education system.
- Developing: In use, literature is not yet widespread.
- Vigorous: Use for face-to-face communication. Threatened: Used, but is losing users.
- Shifting: The child-bearing can use the language among themselves, but is not being transmitted to children.
- Moribund: The only remaining active users are members of the grandparent generation and older.
- Nearly extinct: The only remaining users of the language are members of the grandparent generation or older who have little opportunity to use the language.
- Dormant: The language serves as a reminder of heritage identity, but no one has more than symbolic proficiency.
- Extinct: The language is no longer used and no one retains a sense of ethnic identity with the language.

- Same with signed languages.
- Alternate
  - Dispersed: Fully developed in its home country, but these are not promoted in the country in focus via institutionally supported education.
  - Reawakening: The ethnic community associated with a dormant language is working to establish more uses/users for the language.
  - Second language only: No vehicular function, not the heritage language of an ethnic community.

## The Waggle Dance of the Honeybee
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFDGPgXtK-U)

- Bees find the food source individually.
- The angle of the 8th dance represents the angle of where the hive is.
- They are able to see UV and polarized light, which allows them to determine the location of the sun at all times (they can see where the sun is even in a cloud.
- Finely tuned internal clock: can estimate the position of its sun given the time. It can know where the sun is even in a dark beehive (and can even figure out seasons).
- In the beehive, it's vertical oriented so they bee can only go up or down. So "up", away from gravity, substitutes the angle for the sun. The angle that bee makes with the direct "up" represents the angle the bees should go to. 90 degrees to the left = 90 degrees to the left of the sun. Directly towards the ground = fly directly away from the sun. The bee also changes its dance depending on the sun's position in the day.
- Longer durations of the dance = farther away. 1 second = 1 km from the food.
- Distance in bees means the amount of time they take to get there = headwind means longer dances.
