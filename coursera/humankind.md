## 1.2—The Human Family 1st Segment

It was around 70K years ago that cultures started to develop.

History is simply the next stage in the process of ongoing complexity in the universe.

## Revolutions

* *Cognitive Revolution (70 KYA):* Homo sapiens evolved unique cognitive abilities that gave it immense power
* *Agricultural Revolution (12 KYA):* Homo sapiens domesticated animals and plants, established cities.
* *Scientific Revolution (500 YA):* Homo sapiens gains more and more power by understanding how the world works, is able to manipulate the smallest units of matter.

## Cognitive Revolution

We have existed for about 2.5M years. For a period of time, we were just another animal. For 1000s of years, humans thought of homo sapiens as different animals, where in fact we are members of the family of great apes.

## The Human Family

* Australopithecus ("Southern Ape")
* Homo neanderthalensis ("Man from the Neander Valley"): Europe, Middle East (it was colder then). Bigger, more muscular, have more insulating fats.
* Homo soloensis ("Man from the Solo Valley"): Indonesia. It was better adapted to live in the jungles and swamps in Indonesia/Java.
* Homo floresiensis ("Man from Flores Island"): Indonesia, "The Hobbit". They were very small. Flores used to be connected to the mainland by land. Since there was not many food in the island, the smaller people survived better. They were humans: they manufactured tools, etc.
* Homo erectus ("Upright man"): Very tall, taller than us. 1.8-1.9 meters high. The most successful human species ever in terms of how many years it survived. 1.5 MYA-50 KYA. 
* Homo denisova ("Man from the Denisova cave"): Very recent human discovery, found in central Asia.
* Homo sapiens: 200-300 KYA.
* The general nature is that there were many human species, some were big and some were small.
* From about 2 MYA, there were several human species simultaneously in our world. There is some evidence that Homo sapiens may have killed the other species.

## 1.3—The Human Family 2nd Segment

#### Big Brains

Humans have extraordinarily large brains. A 60 kg mammal has about 200cc brain size. A 60kg human has about 1200-1400cc brain size. It is only humans that have this, not dogs, not cats etc. There is a problem with this big brain: you have to carry it around, you have to protect it with a skull, and it is hard to carry around this big head. It is also hard to fuel this with energy. The brain is about 2-3% of the body weight but it consumes 25% of the energy (at rest). Apes consumes about 8% energy.

So to have more energy, humans spent more time looking for food, and humans became less muscular. The muscles became smaller and weaker. We are 5x weaker than chimps, given the same weight. And the evolution of the human brain, why it became so big, is a mystery of evolution, because for a long time, it didn't seem to do anything special.

#### Walking Upright

When walking upright, it's much easier to scan the savannah in search of prey, because you don't need your hands to move, you can signal your friends or something that you are here, and you can make and use tools.

The problem is the skeleton evolved for a creature that moves on four legs as opposed to two. This exerts stress on the spine and muscle. Even today, people suffer from back pain and stiff necks because of the compromise on the skeleton.

Women paid more for the innovation. Your hips have to be narrow, and their birth canal has to be narrow. While their birth canal was getting smaller, the human (and baby) brain was getting bigger. Women and children began to die during childbirth more than the other great apes.

The solution was giving birth earlier than before, when the baby head was smaller. This evolved through natural selection. *Even now, humans give birth earlier than any other animal.* This is why human babies are helpless and completely dependent on elders for a long time as opposed to baby horses or baby cats who are mobile almost immediately after birth.

Humans evolved social ties because it took many people to bring a child up. This is one of the reasons why tribes were a thing. Because of this, humans can be educated and socialized than a far greater degree than any other mammal.

We often assume that we have advantages because of us being social animals, big brains, but they come as a cost. We were very weak and were preyed upon. There were probably about just a million humans at that time. We ate fruits and vegetables and only small mammals.

One of the first things that humans used tools for was to break open bones and eat the marrow inside. In fact, scientists argue that bone marrow was the niche food that humans ate. Lions eat giraffes, hyenas eat what is left, and humans eat the marrow. The position of humans in the food chain was always in the middle, hunting small animals and being hunted by big animals.

It was around 400 KYA was when Neanderthals started to hunt large animals, and 100 KYA when we jumped to be the top predators.

Psychologically, humans were not used to be at the top of the food chain. Other animals had evolved the position of being a top predator for millions of years already. For humans, it took us almost no time and there was not enough time for humans to adapt themselves to this position. It is better to think of ourselves as a herd of sheep who learned how to use guns and bombs, because we don’t know what to do with power.

## 1.5: The Human Family 3rd Segment

#### Fire

Scientists aren't sure how humans discovered fire. It was the first effective weapon against large animals. It could be used to change the environment for the benefit of humans. But best of all, it enabled humans to cook.

All kinds of foods, especially plants such as wheat and potatoes, can now be eaten by humans. Cooking also kills germs and parasites that may otherwise enter the body and kill them. It is also made it easier for us to digest food (chimps need 5 hours, we need about 1 hour). What happens is that we outsource our digestion to fire, we consume less energy. So we can survive with smaller teeth and jaws and smaller intestines.

Scholars believe that there is a direct link between the start of cooking, the shortening of our intestines, and the increase in size of our brain. This is because the two greatest consumers of energy are the brain and the digestive system. Once you shorten your intestines, you can have a bigger brain. The jump in brain size 400K ago also coincided with the start of cooking.

For every being, the power depends on the body. While animals can harness the power of wind and water, they cannot decide and control these forces. Ex: Eagles cannot control wind when it is not there, and their bodies constrain the control they can exert over nature.

Humans were able to get control of an obedient force. They can use when and where to use fire, and the power of fire is not limited by the body of the human (someone can burn a forest by themselves).

In this respect, the domestication of fire was the first important step on the way to the atomic bomb.
 
## 1.6: The Human Family 4th Segment


Almost all scholars agree that by 150 KYA, East Africa was populated by Homo sapiens that looked like you and me. And during 70 KYA, they arrived in the Middle East, which was populated by the other human species.

The *Interbreeding theory* says that as Sapiens spread throughout the world, they bred with the other humans. Middle Eastern people are suggested to have a mix of Neanderthal in them. Humans who went to China and East Asia are also speculated to have interbred with Erectus.

The *Replacement theory* says that there was no sex between Neanderthals and Sapiens, and children between them are infertile, and the Neanderthals died out. This means that all humans living today share the same ancestors in East Africa.

These theories have political repercussions, as if replacement theory is correct, everyone is equal, and if interbreeding is right, not everyone is equal (political dynamite). For a time, Replacement theory has always been thought to be the safe and politically correct decision. But in 2010, when they mapped the Neanderthal genome and they compared it with people today, it turned out that about 4% of the unique human genes in Europe and the Middle East were from the Neanderthals. Also, up to 6% of the genes in Aboriginals and Melanasians were from the Denisovans.

4% or 6% is a very small number. If there is a merger, there should be about 50% Neanderthal genes. Based on the recent events, Neanderthals and Sapiens were not of completely different species because they have fertile offspring. But they are also not completely the same.

At about 50 KYA, Neanderthals, Sapiens, and Denisovans were at that border point of change. How did the Neanderthals die out?

A possibility was because of the competition for food, the Neanderthals starved. Another was genocide between the Neanderthals and Sapiens. This is very plausible because humans are not known to be a tolerant species. Even in modern times, a group of Sapiens could be intolerant of someone else that is not of the same religion or same skin color, what more for a different species? There could also be a combination of both, some had no violence, some were exterminations.

The disappearance of Neanderthals is one of the big “what-ifs”, what would happen if there had been several human species coexisted side by side? Would religions have unfolded differently? Would politics be the same? There is a lot to think about here.

This is why the disappearance of Neanderthals affected a lot of things; it changed the way we interpret things. Over the years, Homo sapiens has existed by ourselves that it has been hard for us to accept something else. When Darwin said that Homo sapiens was “just another animal”, people were outraged.

Perhaps this is why we killed the Neanderthals: they were too similar to us to ignore, but they were too different to tolerate their existence. So, the solution is to exterminate them.

What we do know was that whenever Sapiens arrived, the other humans living there became extinct. Neanderthals disappeared 30 KYA, the last was the Flores, 12 KYA. They left a few genes in our DNA, but they also left us as the last surviving human species.
 
## 2.1: The Cognitive Revolution 1st Segment

A modern doctor cannot dissect the difference between Sapiens in East Africa and modern humans. Even their brain were the same in both size and external shape.

The first time the Sapiens travelled to the M East (100 KYA), they were driven back by the Neanderthals. No fossils for 30K years (they lost). By 70 KYA, when they travelled to the M East, now they drove all the human species to extinction. 60 KYA they reached Korea. 40 KYA they landed in Australia. (They were the first humans there.) 15 KYA they reached America (first humans too).

The Sapiens couldn’t swim to get to Australia. In order to get to America, they had to survive the cold temperature to survive in Siberia and Alaska.

This is remarkable because for a long amount of time, they were used to the African Savannah. How did they adapt to the different conditions of the world?

This is the first indication that something was happening to the Sapiens beginning 70 KYA. Not only did Sapiens spread, but it also adapted. It was also in 70 KYA that there was also an appearance of new technologies.

- *Boats/rafts:* Sapiens used this to travel to islands.
- *The needle:* one of the most important inventions in the history. While people (including Neanderthals) had worn clothing before, they couldn’t sew things together. Once Sapiens was able to sew clothing, boots, and tents, they were now able to adapt to the cold. (Neanderthals were not able to get to cold Scandinavia).
- *Oil lamps:* you put the animal fats inside. Sapiens were able to get into caves and to produce pictures on the walls.
- *Upgrades:* Prior to 70 KYA, everyone used the same tools (spear points). But since 70 KYA, new styles of spear points were being released every few thousands of years.
- *Jewelry, art, praying, complex societies (100s of people), religion:* 30 KYA sculpture with the head of lion and body of human. Sapiens has always had the ability to imagine things that did not exist.

Scholars believed that these inventions were because of a cognitive revolution that happened 70 KYA. While our ancestors in E Africa looked like us and had a brain size like us, they were not able to talk like us. The 70 KYA people who settled Australia, they were like us.

*History begins with this cognitive revolution.*

Scholars believe that there was a change in the internal structure of the brain that led to all the big revolutions in Sapiens’ abilities. There might have been some part of the brain that became connected to create our abilities. We still don’t know why this happened. This might have been pure chance, but still, it happened. What changed?

## 2.2: The Cognitive Revolution 2


* It is speculated that it is our language that separated us during this cognitive revolution.
* Our language is not the only language, nor is it the first. Most animals, even insects, have language. They communicate via chemicals and they can communicate via these chemicals.
* Was our language the first vocal language? There have been many vocal languages long before 70 KYA, and there are many animals that use sound and voice to communicate among themselves.
* Ex: Green monkeys. To the human ear, every sound they make sounds the same, but when you play these to the monkeys, they react differently. Ex: One word means “careful.” All the monkeys that heard that word reacted accordingly. Another word made the monkeys react by looking at the sky, it was “careful, there is an eagle.”
* So vocal language is not unique to us. It is also wrong to say that we have the most sophisticated language. Whales and elephants have in some respects better vocal abilities because they can communicate over hundreds of kilometers through the ocean. A parrot could also say anything that Einstein could say.
* What’s so special about language, then? 
* Our language is amazingly complex in the way that it can transmit information across the world. We can connect signs and sounds that can produce sentences with distinct meaning. It’s not about the number of sounds but the number of meanings.
* Green monkeys can tell limited things, such as “there is a lion.” Humans can say that “there is a lion in the river”, and humans can create a plan to kill the lion.
* The unique language of Sapiens evolved that the most important information that humans shared was not about lions and bison etc., but it was more of for ourselves. Gossiping is very important to us. Since humans are social animals, it is not enough to know about lions, but it is important to know things about your band. Who is sleeping with who, who is likely to help you, who you will help when a battle occur.
* Not only do you know the individual characters, but you also have to know how people relate to each other. In order to function in society, you need to have a staggering amount of information about your fellow band members. In a band of 50 people, there are about 1.2K relationships 1v1 relationships.
* All of the apes show a keen importance of their socials, but they cannot gossip as a limitation of their language.
* It is estimated that the Neanderthals/old Sapiens were interested in other people, but they could not talk behind people’s backs.
* While this sounds like a joke, other disciplines have seen the importance of gossip. Much of the information we get through emails, shows, etc., are information about other people.
* When there was no police, gossip was the police. This was some sort of enforced morality.

## Lesson 3: The Cognitive Revolution 3

* The truly unique thing about language is not to transmit information about lions and men, but the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all, such as legends. Things such as “the lion is the guardian of our tribe” are unique to our language.
* This is why we call the Sapiens languages a fictive language, or a language that can talk about fictional things. You can never convince any other animal to do things so that they go to animal heaven. Sapiens is the only animal that can believe such stories.
* Some think that this is a disadvantage for Sapiens because it is deceiving. It is also a waste of time. The fact is, the fictive language could be the most important advantage of Sapiens over other animals. This fictive language enables humans to imagine things together and collectively via our common myths and legends. 
* While there are other animals who do things collectively (ants and bees), they cannot cooperate flexibly. Their cooperation is embedded in the DNA, and they could not change how they operate. Other social animals like chimpanzees and elephants and dolphins can figure out stuff flexibly, but they cannot cooperate with each other to say their problems.
* Humans can do both. The complexity of our societies is unmatched through the animal kingdom.
Chimps
* Chimps live in troops of 50. They cooperate and hunt with each other and they can fight other troops. They have a hierarchical structure with an alpha male leading the charge. Alpha males intervene when two chimps fight. They also get the best food for themselves, and they prevent lower males from mating with the females in the band.
* You cannot be the alpha male by beating everybody up. You become an alpha male by getting an extensive amount of supporters. There are known cases of relatively weak males that become alpha males because there is a strong coalition of females supporting him.
* Coalitions are based on contact and mutual favors. Alphas give food to their supporters. A chimp finding food would be more likely to interact with members of his own coalition. 
* There is a limit to the size of groups. All members of a band must know each other intimately. If they didn’t know a chimp, then they wouldn’t know if the other is trustworthy, or the other’s rank. This is why a chimp society splits when it is too big. Magic number: just a few dozen.
* Only in rare cases do you observe a troop of more than 100 chimps. Separate troops of chimps not only do not cooperate, but they compete for food. There have been cases of prolonged warfare and genocide (systematic killing) between groups.
* Humans, just like chimps, have intuitions, but they are adapted for small groups only. Even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the maximum size for a group bonded by gossip is 150 people. This is why a critical threshold of human communities is around that number, +- a few individuals.
* Below this number, each member can maintain social acquaintances (there aren’t many rules and ranks needed). Above this number, you’ll have chaos. You’ll need to divide people up.
* It’s well known that small family businesses have a problem when they get bigger. How did Sapiens cross this critical threshold of individuals, when we don’t have instincts which are appropriate for this?
* The secret is fictive language. Large numbers of humans can cooperate with this shared language. Literally all large groups of humans have a fiction or belief or something. Two Catholics can coordinate when they meet even without knowing each other. Two Japanese may risk their lives because both of them believe in the existence of the Japanese homeland. Two people in the same corporation such as Google believe in the same economic myth of money. Two lawyers can combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because they believe in the existence of human rights and justice, even though they do not exist.
* Every single thing that we tell ourselves do not exist outside of our own minds. This is hard to believe, but modern lawyers can be said to be something like tribal shamans. Shamans talk about ghosts and lawyers talk about corporations getting mad at you. In fact, ghosts are easier to understand than corporations (what the heck is corporation anyway?)

## Lesson 4: The Cognitive Revolution 4

The legend of the Peugeot Company
* The trademark is the lion man.
* It was started in NE France 120 years ago. They employ 200K employees who create 1.5M vehicles per year. They make millions of Euro per year.
* What exactly is Peugeot?
* Peugeot is not the cars; the cars are obviously not the company. You can destroy the cars and not destroy Peugeot.
* Peugeot is not the factory; you can destroy the factory and Peugeot still stands.
* You could fire all the employees and the management and replace them, and Peugeot will still exist.
* However, a judge destroys Peugeot using a few magic words to dissolve the company.
* Peugeot exists only in our imagination. This is a fiction called a Limited Liability Company. An LLC means that the liability to the owners is limited, so you can’t sue the people who own it. This is because companies are independent from the people who founded them. If a company borrows money, you cannot get the money from owner if the company cannot pay the money back. (Traditionally, unlimited liability companies deterred entrepreneurs from creating companies as it is harder to take a risk.)
* The LLCs are so important in our economy that we sometimes forget that these are stories in our head, and stories we created.
* If you think about it closely, then someone wearing some fancy robes and going to some complicated ceremony and writing a signature on some legal scripture back in the 1890s created Peugeot.
* The question is, how do you convince people to believe in your story? These stories give Sapiens immense power. It would be really difficult to talk only about things that do exist.
Imagined Reality
* IR is not the same as a lie (a lie is telling something you know it is not true). Green monkeys can lie re: food.
* Unlike lying, everybody believes imagined reality. So it is not a lie because people literally believe in the concept. Peugeot really believed the existence of the Peugeot company. Sculptors really believed in the existence of the lion man. Human rights activists really believe in the existence of the human rights.
* Bottom line is, we have dual realities. There are the objective realities of rivers and trees and lions. There is another imagined reality of gods and nations and corporations.

## Lesson 5: The Cognitive Revolution 5th Segment

* Since large scale cooperation between Sapiens is based between stories, the communication can be changed by changing the story.
* In France, they switched from the story of “The Divine Right of Kings” to the story of “The Sovereign Right of the People.”
* The malleability of stories and culture is important because genetic change is so slow, about 10K years at a time. So we accelerate ourselves to think differently.
Chimps and Bonobos
* Chimps as we know live in hierarchical societies with an alpha male.
* Bonobos are led by an alliance of females. The differing social structures between chimps and bonobos represent the DNA differences (and up to a point the individual personalities and the environments).
* Macaques: they were able to clean sweet potatoes by washing them in the water. Even after she died, the kids imitated their elder. Up to now, 60 years after, they still know how to wash stuff. So animals can pass things culturally, but this is rare, and this involves basic things such as washing potatoes.
* Female chimps cannot take lessons from Bonobos for women chimp rights. Similarly, male chimps cannot make a social revolution re: the rights of every chimp. The social structure necessitates a change in DNA if change is to happen.
* Archaic humans did not initiate any political or social revolutions. Changes in behaviors were from genetic mutations or from changes in habitat. Homo erectus who lived 100 KYA and 500 KYA had literally the same tools.
* Ever since the 70 KYA revolution, Sapiens has been able to change their technology quickly without the need for social change.
* Think of childless elites (Catholic priests and popes, Buddhist monks, etc.). These were dominant members of society who were giving up the power of procreation. How do they survive with these alpha males not reproduce? They passed on stories, not genes.
* A German woman born in 1900 and dying in 2000 would have a lot of stories changing through her life (2nd Reich, WWI, WWII, East German communism, reunification of Germany), even though she had the same DNA in her life.
* This is why 1v1, Neanderthals would destroy Sapiens physically, but 100v100, Sapiens would destroy Neanderthals. Sapiens would coordinate better.
* There is no evidence of Neanderthal trade, and Sapiens traded a lot. If Sapiens traded physical stuff, it is not impossible to think that they traded stories too. Sapiens was also able to hunt in a large scale by surrounding animals and constructing traps.
Summary
* People are able to communicate about data in the outside world so they were able to coordinate things such as avoiding lions.
* Gossiping is important because talking about others allowed humans to live in groups.
* Large quantities of information about things that don’t exist (fiction) is important because these enable cooperation between large groups of people. These are also used for social behavior.
* The cognitive revolution, 70 KYA, is the dividing line between biology and history. Prior to this, Sapiens was just like any other animal. Since this revolution, biological models of explanation are no longer sufficient. From here, we can’t just rely on biological information but we have to rely on historical data. We can’t explain the French Revolution using biology.
* Remember that the people who left East Africa were already like us, cognitive-wise.
 
## 3.1:Daily Life in the Stone Age

* If you really want to understand us Sapiens how we think, you have to understand how the Stone Age people lived, because most of us throughout the history of the world was to be peasants.
* Many of the problems of the world today are the result of this very problematic interaction between the minds and bodies of hunter-gatherers and cities.
* Evolutionary psychology: Not only is the body shaped by evolutionary pressures, but the mind is, too.
* Ex: Eating habits. The way we eat today is shaped by the conditions of our ancestors. We have obesity because the most sensible thing to do is to eat as many food as possible. Eating sweet food was very rare in the savannah so it was a good idea to eat many fruits and to eat as many fruits as possible. It is genetically good for us to eat a ton of food at one sitting.
* Nowadays, my basic DNA doesn’t tell me that I’m in an affluent society, they still think that I’m in the African savannah, and they tell me to eat a ton of food.
* Ex: Sexual habits. 40-50K years ago, humans lived in communes, and male and females had multiple sexual partners. If  you lived in a band, you see the others behave in very adverse conditions (such as hunting mammoths) as opposed to husband/wife combinations today. So people knew each other more deeply.
* Before, children were raised by a tribe of people, not by just one person. An entire commune raised the children. The concept of fatherhood was actually non-existing in the original communes because men can never be sure if a child was theirs or somebody else because of the lack of monogamy.
* Some tribes today still believe in a concept called collective fatherhood. When the child is growing in the womb of the mother, it is nourished by the sperm of different men. Until the 19th-20th century, people did not have the knowledge that children were born from one man and one woman. Women were asked to have sex with more than one man to get multiple talents.
* Experts argue that the difficulties and infidelities we experience with families are because of the disconnect between our current culture and our nuclear makeup.
* The last evidence we have for ancient man is to watch the current hunter-gatherers in Australia and the Kalahari. It’s hard to assume that those who live there lived in the same way that people lived 40-50K years ago.
* There were hundreds of thousands of bands of humans, you can literally have people from present-day Oxford and present-day Cambridge and they would have different languages or different beliefs. The really important point is that every since the Cognitive Revolution, there have been several “ways of life” for Sapiens. Each society had differing characteristics.

## 3.2: Daily Life in the Stone Age: Segment 2

#### Dogs

Most members of human society after the agricultural society are not humans; but are domesticated animals. Even today, the society of New Zealand is made up of 5 million humans, and a bunch of sheep. The exception to the rule though is dogs. The dog is the first animal to be domesticated, we have hard evidence that about 50K years ago that dogs were with humans.

Dogs also were buried in the same ways that humans were buried (these happened in Asia and in the Middle East). They were used for hunting and for alarms. This is interesting since wolves rarely bark and dogs bark all the time.

Dogs who were good barkers, good at understanding human commands, and manipulating humans by being cute were able to survive. So humans manipulate dogs and dogs manipulate humans. This is why dogs have the best understanding of human communication.

#### Intimacy

Another thing that characterized human bands was the high level of intimacy. Between different bands, the relations had both hostile contact and friendly contact. They exchanged members, different bands came together for a big hunt, different bands traded luxury items such as seashells, they might have formed political alliances, maybe they came together to celebrate common religious festivals. This is what gave Sapiens can do and Neanderthals couldn’t. Even if the relationships were done a few months at a time, it was enough to build the relationships.

Most humans moved from place to place. They did this because of the climate, of the animals migration. There are also exceptional cases where humans could set up permanent fishing villages (earliest village). The first recorded instance was in Indonesia 45 KYA and it is from these camps that humans had their first trans-Oceanic venture into Australia.

Human bands ate a lot of things. They ate insects, they picked mushrooms and berries and nuts, they trapped rabbits, and they hunted bison and mammoth. In terms of calories, gathering was usually more important than hunting.

Ancestors who were foragers were more fit than people today. They were also intelligent: they needed to know the camp orientation, how animals were, technical skills such as hunting lions and stuff. It is expected that they had to know a lot of technical knowledge to know to survive, more than people today. For ex, even though I am a history teacher, and I am technically skilled there, I do not have any idea how to farm wheat, to make shoes and clothes, etc. as opposed to today wherein you have specialized knowledge about your topic. While at the collective level we know more than the ancients, they know more about stuff, individually.

Since the agricultural revolution, the size of the human brain began to shrink. In agricultural societies, you could literally be an idiot peasant and live a rewarding lifestyle. So you don’t need to learn as much as you did in the past.

People in affluent societies work 40-45 hours per week. Developing countries work in hours from 50-80 per week. Hunter-gatherers worked 30-35 hours per week to hunt once every three days. Foragers also did less with maintaining the house because the modern stuff that we worked on such as cleaning the house and replacing diapers.

The ancients had better careers working as hunter-gatherers rather than peasants in industry. Compare the life of a ancient Chinese forager and a modern Chinese factory worker. In most cases, ancient foragers were less likely to suffer from malnutrition and were taller than peasants today. Average life expectancy was 40 years (which was the same with everyone until about 200 years ago). This is not because 40 was old, but because of the high levels of child mortality which influence the statistics of how things are averaged.

When most of your food comes from a single source, you have a high chance of not getting the proper food for daily life. You can’t have all your calories come from a single source. You need your minerals and vitamins too. It’s speculated that there was the foragers had a large variety of food, about 100 different types, and because of this, the foragers were able to protect themselves from calamities which hit a particular food.

Foragers also did not suffer much from the infectious diseases that plague the peasants today. Most of these diseases are transmitted from domesticated animals to humans. Because ancient foragers did not domesticate animals except for dogs, they did not develop infectious diseases.

Foragers also lived in small communities throughout the country where it was not that easy to spread disease. When people lived in a city together with their garbage and toilets and pigs, this was a more ideal place for diseases to spread.

Experts say that the original affluent societies existed long before the Agricultural Revolution.

*You should not judge history from your perspective as a middle class or elite, judge it from the perspective of the peasants. In fact, people living 20 KYA lived better than the peasants today.*

## 3.3: Daily Life in the Stone Age: Segment 3

Animistic beliefs were common among the ancient foragers. Animism is the belief that the world is full of animated beings, all of whom can communicate directly. Every animal or tree or rock or stream has natural feelings, desires, and needs, and humans can bargain with it to get what they want. 

In the animist world, objects and living things aren’t the only living thing; the world is also full of immaterial anima such as fairies and spirits. Animists believe there is no communication barrier between humans and entities.

What differentiates animism from religion is that they believe in local beings, of a particular tree or rock or wolf, they aren’t great gods.

Neither is there a strict hierarchy in the world, they don’t exist simply to provide for us. Animists do not give importance to all-important gods and to humans. It’s like there is just a community of entities.

Animism is not a religion; it is a generic and umbrella name for all the cults and stuff of a common place about the world. Modern religions (theists) share this thing called a great god and a hierarchy of where humans are it.

Most of the evidence we have about religion come from a very limited number of status and paintings. Lascaux painting: A man with a bird head with an erect penis being killed by a bison, and there is a bird underneath.

What you see in the painting is that the soul (a bird) is being released from death. So the painting depicts the passage from this life to the next.

Venus sculpture in Austria: Some say that they worshipped femininity and they were in matriarchal societies (there were no male figures). Some also say that these are very chauvinistic and they were an ancient attempt by men to control female sexuality. Still some thing that these are just ancient pornography.

Cave of the Hands in Argentina: Not just made by one person, made by multiple.

Honestly, we just know that they were animists, but that’s just what we know. We don’t know their taboos, their festivals, etc.

## 3.4: Daily Life in the Stone Age: Segment 4

One of the most remarkable findings of the last decades was made in Sungir, Russia, re: a society that hunted mammoths 30 KYA. They were able to find a grave with a 50-year old man with ivory bracelets and a hat with fox teeth. Other graves did not have that many ivory goods.

It was deduced that that society was a hierarchical society and that this guy was a chief.

Another grave: boy with 5,000 ivory beads and a decorative hat with fox teeth. A girl was also covered with ivory beads and jewelry. Ivory statues surrounded both children. Each of the beads took 45 minutes to make, which means that it took 3 years to make all of the beads.

It is extremely unlikely that these children were chiefs; one belief is that they were children of the chiefs. Another theory is that they were thought that they were reincarnations of spirits. The last theory was that the children were ritually sacrificed for the leader and were also buried with great magnificence (other civilizations did this too).

This proves that there was some kind of hierarchy and social inequality 30 KYA.
 
#### Warfare

It is suggested that large-scale warfare began during the Agricultural Revolution, because there was nothing to fight about (re: land) before the AR.

Others thought that large-scale revolution is embedded in our genes and that life is excessively cruel and violent.

We can use anthropological evidence by observing modern-day foragers. Foragers in the Kalahari don’t fight each other. We can’t assume much though, because it may be because of the low population density or it may be because of modern states.

Anthropologists have found that there was a large number of warfare when they first went to America and Australia.

We do not have any clear evidence for large-scale evidence from more than 20 KYA. (We just don’t have much evidence.) From the period after 20 KYA until the outbreak of the Agricultural Revolution (10 KYA) .

Portugal excavation, just before the AR, 2 of 400 skulls only were attributable to human violence. Israel: 1 of 100. Ancient Danube valley: 18 of 400 (4.5%).  That’s high! Today, it’s just 1.5%.

In the Sudan and in Germany, 24 of 59 skeletons had arrowheads stuck in them were killed violently.

So what is representative? Neither. Just as foragers had different religions, they also had a variety of attitudes.

## 4.1: The Human Flood

Most of the ancients lived in the Eurasia-African landmass. They were able to move to nearby islands, but not to America/Australia/Madagascar/Hawaii.

It's very rare for animals to travel from continent to continent by themselves. In fact, _Homo sapiens_ was the first animal to bring the other animals from continent to continent.

The first breakout happened 45 KYA to Australia. How could have Sapiens reached Australia? Even though there are islands between Indonesia and Australia, there are stretches of open sea up to 150km across. Then, they had to adapt to the new environment of Australia.

The closest theory is that the Sapiens of Indonesia was the first seafaring civilizations. They made a living by going out to sea. We have no idea how.

It is unprecedented that humans who adapted themselves to live in land went in a few couple of thousand of years evolved to be able to live at sea. Contrast this to dolphins, who were originally from the land, and it took millions of years for these creatures to evolve into dolphins that lived in the oceans.

From a human perspective, the journey to Australia was the first time that any human species managed to live out of the Afro-Asian ecological system. It was the first time that any large terrestrial animal moved from Afro-Asia to Australia.

The moment that the first hunter-gatherer set foot on Australia was when Sapiens moved from the middle tier to the highest tier of species in terms of adaptation. Humans usually did not change the environment they dwell in. 

Sapiens transformed Australia 50 KYA. Australia was different 50 KYA. It had a giant kangaroo and giant koalas and big birds and giant lizards and 5m snakes and marsupial lions. Within a few thousand years, these animals vanished, 24 large animals became just 1 (the red kangaroo). Food chains throughout the entire Australian ecosystem were rattled.

This is because large animals breed slowly and the offspring number is very low. And even though Sapiens only had Stone Age technology, they had the element of surprise. In Africa and Asia, humans evolved slowly, and they acquired skills over thousands of years. Because this happened slowly, the animals gradually learned to be afraid of humans. Australian animals weren’t able to adapt in time. Remember that humans do not look particularly frightening.

Fire agriculture: Australia was grassland so it was easy to spread fire through it. Eucalyptus trees were rare in Australia up to 45 KYA. They were only widespread after humans came. (Eucalyptus is more resistant to fire than other trees).

Climate also played a significant role: about 45 KYA, something destabilized Australia. When the ecosystem was brittle, Sapiens appeared.

We have enough evidence to be convinced that the climate change would not be enough to cause a massive extinction event if Sapiens didn’t get there. In fact, this event was the first big thing that our species did to change the environment.
 
## 4.2: The Human Flood Segment 2

Sapiens arrived in Alaska via land bridge, in pursuit of large game animals such as mammoths and reindeer.

Humans arriving in the Americas were able to adapt themselves quickly to the differing ecological systems. In 2000 years, they were able to move to the southernmost point of Argentina. No other animal up to that time had been able to move that far without any genetic mutation.

Even ants, they can survive anywhere, but the ants in Mexico were different from the ants in Mississippi and the ants in the Pampas.

America had a different ecosystem: saber-tooth tigers, giant sloths (6m high), giant birds, oversized lions, mastodons and mammoths. Within a few thousand years, most of these large creatures disappeared. Within a few thousand years, North America lost 50 genera of species, and South America about the same. Even the little animals, such as mammoth ticks and mammoth fleas, became extinct.

Extinctions did not stop when we became farmers. Every time we colonized and island, the animals became extinct. Ex: Madagascar (400 km east of Africa). For millions of years, there were evolutionary processes there that were isolated from the rest of the world. Ex: elephant bird (3m high), giant lemurs (larger than gorillas. These vanished about 1500 KYA, when we have the first evidence of humans arriving to Madagascar.

This is similar to most islands in the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, and even the Arctic Oceans. So there were two waves of extinction: the extinction due to hunter-gatherers, and the extinction due to agriculture. Now, we are having the third wave, the wave of industry. And honestly, Homo sapiens never really lived harmonically with nature.
 
## 5.1: History’s Biggest Fraud Segment 1

If things were so good at the time of the hunter-gatherers, then why did the Agricultural Revolution happen?

For the first 2.5M of their existence, even after the cognitive revolution, humans fared well without agriculture.

Agricultural Revolution: The transition to agriculture from a life of hunting and gathering.

Of the thousands of species that we had, there were just a handful of species that can be domesticated. That’s why agriculture arises only in some places, such as the Middle East.

*There is no evidence that people became more intelligent around the time of the Agricultural Revolution.* Foragers knew how plants and animals reproduced already.

Hunting and agriculture also did not necessarily improve the lives of people. Agriculture created: pampered elites (they ate all the food), peasants who worked harder but ate less food, and a boom in population.

The culprit: the plants themselves. For a long time, wheat was just a wild grass in the Middle East and now it is one of the most successfully spread out plant.

Wheat didn’t like pebbles and rocks where it was growing, so humans broke their backs tilling the soil. Wheat didn’t like sharing water with other plants, so humans cleared stuff.

The human body was not adapted to backbreaking work (we are more suited to climbing trees and hunting) so we had more disabilities like discs and arthritis.

Because wheat took a frigging huge effort from Sapiens, that’s why Sapiens settled!
 
## 5.2: History’s Biggest Fraud Segment 2

Conflict was higher in agricultural societies than in hunter-gatherer societies because there wasn’t any compromise for losing your land, there wasn’t any place you can go to.

15% of all deaths was because of another man, 25% for men. (Now it’s about 1% for men).

So violence was actually greater, and for that specific time, people were honestly more fucked (we’d have people dying from malnutrition more).

What did wheat offer peasants that it convinced people to adapt to the different life in agriculture? Wheat did not offer anything to people as individuals. As a collective though, wheat provided more food over a limited territory.

Ex: The Oasis of Jericho can support 100 people before, now they can support 1000 people. While these 1000 people may be less happier than their ancestors, there were more of them. Evolution measures success not by the “quality of life”, but by the number of copies of DNA in existence. If there are not more copies of the DNA, then the species becomes extinct. The AR means you get to keep more people alive under worse conditions.

If it’s good for the group, why should an individual agree with this? We don’t know.

Giving up the movement lifestyle in favor of the agricultural lifestyle made it possible for women to raise children every year because of less danger because they don’t move around much.

#### Cons
- There were more diseases because people got infectious diseases from domesticated animals.
- Because town dwellers lived in close places, they were beside their shit always, which was unhygienic.
- Their diet was less healthy (wheat + wheat + wheat). Greatest suffering was done to the babies. Hunter-gatherer babies suckled on mother’s milk. AR babies were fed wheat porridge and gruel.
- In most agricultural societies, at least 1/3 of the babies born died from all kinds of infectious diseases before reaching adulthood.

In spite of all the disease and death, the birth of babies outpaced the death rate.
 
## 5.3: History’s Biggest Fraud Segment 3

People didn’t foresee that more children mean more mouths to feed.

Feeding children gruel and porridge is unhealthy for the children.

By eating just wheat, humans exposed themselves to a vulnerability to drought.

People did not abandon the plan because it took several generations before the people knew that this was bad for them, people didn’t remember because several generations elapsed, and the population just kept growing and growing.

*The desire to have a better life actually trapped humans to what is actually a worse life.*

One of the lows of history is that luxuries become luxuries over time.

Not all human bands made the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture. The AR did not require that every band join in. It required only one band in a region to do so. When one band settles down, agricultural in that world was irresistible. So farmers multiplied faster than foragers, and farmers would always beat foragers in a fight. The foragers could either run away, get massacred, or you changed yourselves to be farmers.

The story of the AR leaves a very important message: that humans are always looking for ways to make their lives easier, but sometimes this attempt causes a ton of change, and they make the lives of humans harder than before.

The AR was not planned by anybody, it just was the accidental result of a series of very small decisions that accumulated together to transform the world.

#### Cultural and Religious Beliefs

In Gobekli Tepi, Turkey, archaeologists uncovered structures (decorated) with pillars that were up to 5 meters high. While Stonehenge was dated 2500 BC, Gobekli Tepe was built 9000 BC, and it seems that the people who built these were from pre-agricultural societies.

Gobekli Tepe could only have been built by people who believed in some sort of cultural or religious belief.

The initial domestication of wheat by humankind was located 30 km ago, which was thought to be the village.

Most of the time, it was village, temple. In GT, it was temple, village.

The switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture can be due to cultural reasons, and not because of economic pressures.

## 5.4: History’s Biggest Fraud Segment 4

The AR affected animals too. Humans hunting wild sheep learned that it was beneficial to kill the adult rams as opposed to the ewes (selective hunting). Next, they wanted to protect the herd, so they protected them from lions, other humans etc. Then, the human band confined the sheep to a certain area. Lastly, humans made a careful selection to kill off the wild rams and wandering ewes.

Another theory: keep sheep fat when you have food, then slaughter it when you run out of food.

Over generations, you’d have a herd of submissive sheep.

Domesticated animal provided: food, transportation, raw materials (sheep).

Chickens, cows, sheep, horses were found only in Afro-Eurasia. Now, we have 1M sheep, 1M pigs, 1.5M cows, and 25M chicken. Chicken is the most widespread fowl, while sheep, pigs, and cows are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th most populous large mammal (after humans).

While these animals are evolutionarily successful, these animals might as well be the most miserable animals ever. This is because the domestication of animals was super brutal.

The lifespan of a chicken is 7 years, and for cows, 25 years. In contrast, these animals are slaughtered usually after just a few weeks or months.

To get animals to do human things, their social ties and sexual stuff were cut. Almost always, males are castrated to restrain aggression.

So an ox, much like its peasant master, spends its life in hard labor, not having social ties with any other oxen. When they can’t pull the yoke any further, they are slaughtered.

Pigs = very intelligent and difficult to control. In Papua New Guinea, because pigs are important, pig noses are cut. Pigs are nearly blind and they can’t look for things when their noses are cut. Sometimes, their eyes are gouged.

Cows produce milk only after their calves are produced, and only for as long as these calves are living. So the dilemma is that you want some calves to live to ensure the continuation of the herd, but you want to kill the calves so they don’t drink milk.

What happens is that milk cows are almost constantly pregnant, and are killed off after 5 years when their milk productions decrease. Sometimes, you kill the calf, then fill something that looks like a cow with cow stuffing, and show it to the mom to produce more milk.

## 6.1: Building Pyramids Segment I

* While the AR was successful from an evolutionary standpoint (7M humans 1.5M cows to 7B humans 7B cows), individual humans, cows, and bulls now fare worse that their ancestors.
* With the AR came the appearance of far more complex humans societies. They were able to build cities with thousands and millions of people.
* Agriculture can produce more food than foraging given the same size of land.
* It doesn’t follow though that people could know how to distribute food in the best way possible.
* It wasn’t food shortages that caused most of the wars. The French Revolution, WWI, WWII, and 1990s Serbia did not begin because of food shortages, but they broke because of human disagreement about things.
* Even though there is enough food in the land between Jordan and the Mediterranean, people cannot agree on the politics and religion. Sapiens has no natural instincts to interact with a large amount of strangers. We’ve always lived in small societies, and we don’t have “corporate instincts” to deal with large populations.
* So, Sapiens couldn’t rely of his instincts, but he has to rely on the fabricated myths of fiction.
* 1st millennium BC: Roman Empire, Han Empire. These were based on the belief of common imagined realities, and the imagined order means thtat the social and legal norms that sustain these empires that kept the society stable was not based on instinct, but it was based on beliefs and shared realities.
* Compare: Code of Hammurabi: 1776 BC, which formed the basis for Babylon, and 1776 Constitution, which forms the basis for the USA.
* The aim of the text of the Code of H was to show H as a just king, and to teach future generations how a just king behaves or a just king acts.
* This was important because the bureaucratic elite canonized the text as the “code of ethics to follow”.
Examples
* If a superior man should blind the eye of a superior man, then they should blind his eye. If he should blind the eye of a common, then he should pay 60 silver shekels of silver in compensation. If a superior man strikes a superior woman and kills her fetus, then he should pay 10 shekels for her fetus. If that woman should die, then they should kill her daughter. If a superior man strikes a commoner and kills her fetus, he pays 10 shekels. If the woman should die, then he pays 30 shekels. If a superior man strikes a slave woman and her fetus dies, he should pay 2 shekels, and if the woman dies, he should pay 20 shekels to the slave’s owner.
* “These are the just decisions that the just Hammurabi has established. I have not been neglectful.”
* Hammurabi’s code asserts that it is from the code. A key component of this code is hierarchy. People are divided into 2 genders and 3 classes (superior, commoners, and slaves). Members of each gender and class have different value. 1 female commoner = 30 shekels, 1 slave = 20 shekels, eye of a commoner man = 60 shekels.
* Children are not independent persons, but children are the property of their parents. This is why the punishment for killing a man’s daughter is to have your own daughter killed (weird because the killers itself is not harmed).
* If everyone behaved accordingly, then the million habitants of the Babylonian empire would be prosperous, and it could protect itself against its enemies, and acquire better health and security.
America
* The representatives of the thirteen colonies felt that the king of England was mistreating them, so they choose to fight versus the king.
* The independence principle dictated by the Americans was the opposite of Babylon. “We hold these truths that all men are created equal, and that everyone was entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
* The American Declaration of Independence also believes that if humans act In the way it was declared, then there will be harmony.
* So we have two texts that suggest how humans should live in society. Both of them outline justice, but they can’t both be right.
* Historians believe that both of them are wrong, because they both imagine a human reality that is governed by a universal principle of justice either in hierarchy or in equality. But in reality, these are just stories that humans believe because there isn’t an objective truth to what the hell “justice” is.
* You’d think that the story of the Babylonians is just a story, but the idea that all humans are equal is also a belief. We can’t really say that humans are objectively equal to each other. 
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’
* Biology thinks that humans are not inherently equal; it is humans (specifically Christians) that think so. So this key term has to be translated to “evolved different”.
* Think that there is just an evolutionary process to get us to this point, so change “endowed by their creator” with “born”.
* “Rights”, there is no such thing as human rights; birds fly not because it is their right, but because they have wings.
* “Unalienable”, we have mutable traits, we can change.
* In biology, there is no such thing as “liberty”. Liberty only exists in our minds. And “happiness”, it doesn’t exist, according to biology. Pleasure exists, but happiness doesn’t.
* Although we believe that all humans are not equal in biology, if we believe that all humans are equal, biologically, it will allow us to create a more stable society.
* Imagined order: we behave in things not because it is objectively true, but because by believing in imagined story, it enables us to cooperate effectively. These are not useless mirages, these are the means by which we can cooperate.
* Hammurabi might have said that “I know that this is just a story, but we should probably believe this too.
* How can you create an empire based on shaky foundations such as this?

## 6.2: Building Pyramids Segment 2

* If human rights are just a story that we invent and believe, is there a danger that our order might collapse?
* Yes, and that is why we have a lot of revolutions throughout history. So humans invest a lot in stabilizing the social order and the stories that uphold the social order. Some of these need violence, such as armies, courts, and police.
* Order also needs some true believers. A priest can convince you to really believe stories that a hundred soldiers don’t.
* In the same phrase, people really believe in the story of capitalism and the story of money.
* From the moment that we are born until we die, we are constantly reminded of these stories in our media and our news and our art. Ex: Since we believe in equality, so we wear jeans, which is the clothes of the working class. Nobles in the Middle Ages believe in hierarchy, so they don’t wear clothes of the working class.
* Fact is, the story our society believes in is interwoven into how we live our lives.
3 Factors that Prevent People from Thinking
Even though the imagined order is only in our minds, we try to link things as much as possible to the actual reality. In order to be powerful, the story must leave the mind and these must take form in the world.
* Ex: Individualism. Every being has value by itself, and it shouldn’t depend on what other people think about you. “Ignore hates, you know what your true value is.”
* Because we believe in individualism, the ideal modern house is divided into several small rooms, so each child has their own private room for autonomy, and children grow up decorating their own room.
* In the Middle Age, it was believed that the value of people were from their place in the hierarchy, and what other people thought and said of them. Noblemen were asked to protect their good name in society.
* Because they believed in hierarchy, the home of the noblemen rarely had an individual room for each of their sons. The teenage sons shared rooms with other people.
The imagined order shapes not only our houses, it also shapes our deepest desires and wishes.
* Most people do not wish to accept the fact that the order governing their lives is imaginary, because it is what shapes their desires.
* Even the most egotistical desire has been planted.
* Ex: going to another country for vacation. Chimps and the elites of many ancient societies didn’t think of these. It’s not natural to want such things, but they have been programmed by their societies to want such things. 
* “Romantic consumerism” is a combination of romanticism and consumerism. Romanticism: Try everything! Travel to a distant land! We hear again and again about how “this new experience changed their life.” Consumerism: if you feel that something is missing in your life, maybe you need to buy stuff, or a service. Every television commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or some service makes your life better.
* Romanticism combines completely with consumerism to bring forth an infinite amount of experiences. The tourism industry doesn’t sell you tickets, it sells you an experience. You don’t go to Paris the city, you go to Paris the experience. These are supposed to make you happier.
* Trips to Paris aren’t because of instinct, it is because of the belief of romantic consumerism.
It is embedded not only in the desires of a single person, it is embedded in the desires of a group of people.
* Even if you free yourself from these desires, you are just one person. You have to convince millions of strangers to believe in what you believe. The imagined order exists in the brains of thousands and millions of people.
* “Objective” is something that exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs. Ex: radioactivity. This isn’t a story, it exists long before anyone knew about it.
* “Subjective”  is something that exists depending on the beliefs of an individual, and it will change if the individual changes. Ex: a child’s imaginary friend. When the child grows up, he doesn’t believe.
* “Inter-subjective” is something that exists within the communication network of many individuals. If a single individual dies, it is not of huge importance, but if the entire group is gone, then the idea dies. Ex: Peugeot company. Even if the CEO stops believing in the Peugeot company, a lot of people believe in it already.
* In order to change an existing order, you have to imagine in a more powerful order. Ex: To stop believing in Peugeot, you have to believe that the French legal system can remove it. And we can’t remove all of these orders, because these have been embedded across the millennia.

## 6.3: Building Pyramids: Segment 3

* You don’t just need food, you also need an imagined order, but these are not enough: you need to have a technique to store and process large amounts of information. Up till the AR, information was stored in the brain.
* Because of the AR, the amount of information you need increased. You can’t realistically store all the information in the brain.
* The new info was no longer descriptive (which foragers needed), but was numerical and mathematical. Information such as taxes and payments needed numbers and data bits.
* The human brain was not adapted to think about numbers. Because of these, for thousands of years after the AR, human societies were still relatively small.
* The first people to combat this was the Sumerians. Large towns began to grow in Sumeria, 4000 BC.
* Some time between 3500 BC and 3000 BC, Sumerians invented a system to store information outside the brain, and this new system was custom built to handle large amounts of mathematical data.
* In this way, the Sumerians were able to get things out, and this information system was called writing.
* Writing was invented not in order to write poetry and philosophy, but in order to map things out and preserve information.
* “Cushing” is the first recorded name in history, this is just some random accountant dude. The first insights in history were about economic documents recording payment of taxes, inventory of goods, etc.
* People who want to influence things need numbers, ex: physics and math.
* The fear people have when seeing math problems aren’t because they’re stupid, but it’s because our brains aren’t built for data processing. 

## 7.1: There is No Justice in History

* How did humans organize themselves in mass corporate networks when we lacked the biological instincts to link ourselves in these networks?
* The appearance of these mass networks was a very dubious blessing, because the imagined order in these kingdoms were neither neutral nor fair. There were different levels; for example, the Code of Hammurabi divided people into the Superior People, the Common People, and the Slaves.
* All societies share some form of this segregation. People are segregated according to their wealth, or their religion, or their race. The principle is that you classify people into different categories, and then you treat people according to their type of category they are in, without knowing what kind of person they are.
* Sometimes the caste if far more important than the individual traits of the spouse. While everyone says that there is just some order to these systems, in some ways trying to justify it as something biological or “cosmic order”.
* Now, the hierarchy of wealth makes people believe that the rich people are intelligent and hardworking, and that no one should be bothered if the rich have better healthcare and nutrition because they have earned it.
* To the best of our knowledge, all of these beliefs are just products of human imagination. Most people hate the segregation of people according to race, but they to most people, they think that the hierarchy between rich and poor is okay, and yet most rich people are rich because they were born poor, and most poor people will die poor because they were born poor.
* All of the hierarchies we have are based on imaginary stories. Unfortunately, all societies seem to drive towards driving a hierarchy. All of these imagined classifications serve an important social function: they enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy to be needed to become personally acquainted.
* Teachers and gurus would know who to accept in their schools. And now that we live in cities, we know how to treat all the strangers even though we don’t know them. We have clues on how to treat them: we treat differently people wearing suits and those wearing rags, people wearing  a religious emblem, etc.
* Most of the abilities of people have to be nurtured and developed; talents become latent if they are not exercised.

## 7.2: There is No Justice in History 2

* All societies are based on a hierarchy but not normally on the same hierarchy. What drives people to divide along such lines? In most cases, the hierarchy that dominates works because of accidental circumstances, but it was generated through generations.
India
* The Hindu caste system formed about 3K years ago. The invaders coming from Central Asia established a hierarchy where they were on top, and the natives were left with the les privileged positions of working ad slaves, etc.
* To prevent social unrest, each class had different rules and each had distinctions. In order to give legitimacy to these classes, the ruling elite said that the caste’s divisions were because to a cosmic order. We see this again and again towards history. It’s often “a particular group is impure”.
* Ideas of impurity persisted up to the point where Indians just believe in the caste system. Of course, the caste system changed and new castes were added. These continued to 3000 castes called Jati.
* Even while the democratic government of India has exerted effort to remove the caste system, it still dominates.
America
* The distinctions between races came from the European invasion and conquest of America, and the importation of millions of African slaves to work in the mines and plantation of America.
* Why did Europeans import slaves from Africa instead of the local Indians or slave Europeans? 
* 90% of the Indian population died in the first century that the Europeans went there.
* Africa was closer to America rather than China or Vietnam. 
* In Africa, there already existed a well-developed slave trade, especially among the Muslims. When the Europeans wanted to import slaves, it was easier to just import the slaves from an existing market than to start a new slave trade from nothing. 
* American plantations were located in the tropical regions of Africa. These areas were plagued by tropical diseases such as malaria,  and Europeans did not have immunity against these diseases. The Africans had a t least a partial immunity to these diseases.
* This resulted in a “European ruling class”. Stories include a theological argument (Africans were argued to be descendants of Ham (Noah’s son) and were inferior), biological theories saying that blacks were inferior, and a medical explanation saying that blacks spread diseases more easily.
* In the same way that the Indians no longer remember the initial conditions of the caste system, Americans believed this story long after the initial conditions of slavery were done.
* America was weird in the sense that it was the only country to abolish slavery, although there was still slavery mentality and separation of people according to race.
* Now, citizens would say “blacks have been free for generations but they don’t have good jobs, so this is proof that blacks are inferior”, even though the true story was that there was an inherent bias in hiring.
* Even up to know, the physical attributes of the white race came to be identified as beautiful, and the physical attributes of the black race came to be identified as ugly.
* Basically, education comes to education.
 
## 7.3: There is no Justice in History Part 3

* Even though you have caste systems in India and racist systems in America, there is a constant hierarchy common across nearly all societies: the hierarchy of men and women.
* For a long time, a woman’s rape was considered to be a “crime against property”, and that a husband raping his wife was illogical, kind of like a man stealing his own wallet.
* 53 countries still think that a man raping his wife was okay and legal. Is this a product of the human imagination, or is this division a natural division with roots deep in the biological reality, and if it is a biological division, are there justifications in biology for the preferences of men over women?
* Obviously some things really are differences between the genders, such as the fact that women are child bearers, since they have wombs. However, most things that we attribute to women or men are attributed because of fictions.
* All societies have notions as to what is natural and is not natural, for example homosexuality, there have been cultures wherein homosexuality is considered okay, and some say it is impure.
* How do we distinguish between what is biology and culture?
Biology enables; culture forbids.
* Biology is willing to tolerate a wide spectrum of things. It’s culture that obliges people to believe some possibilities and close off some of those.
* Ex: Biology enables men to enjoy sex with one another, but some cultures forbid it. Biology enables women to not have children, but some cultures think this is a stigma.
* Most cultures justify culling behaviors because they are “unnatural”, but that is not what unnatural means. An unnatural behavior means that you cannot physically do things. Our concepts of natural and unnatural are often taken from the theological (Christian) meaning.
* According to Christian nature, it was God that created the body, and that each part of the body has a purpose. If we use these organs for the purpose that God intended, then this is natural, and if we use these for other purposes, then this is unnatural.
* According to biology, the human body has been created through randomness. Because we really evolved from fish, then why isn’t the purpose of our hands “swimming”?
* Ex, sex and courtship rituals are used by chimps and humans for things other than procreation. They use sex for intimacy and social stuff, and this is not unnatural, because it is possible.
* So we can’t really say that “the natural purpose of women is to have birth” and that “homosexuality is unnatural”.
* To make things clearer, scholar have different terms: sex for biological categories, and gender for cultural categories.
* The definition of masculinity changes from society to society. Ex: masculinity 300 years ago was wearing a wig, stockings, and high heels. 
* What we consider as “stylish” today (suits etc.) is actually rare. For most of human history and for most of the other animals, the males are often very colorful (peacocks, lions, chiefs of Indian tribes).
* Why do societies across the world gravitate towards being patriarchal?
## 7.4: There is No Justice in History 4

#### Men are physically stronger than women

* Men have forced women into their submission.
* The strength of men monopolized tasks that required manual labor such as plowing the fields, and these gave them control of the economy and political power.
* This is only true for certain types of strength. Women have generally more stamina than men and are more resistant to fatigue.
* There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power between humans. Older people have more power than younger people even though they are much stronger than their elders.
* Political power resided with the people who had the most social skills. The big boss of the mafia is not necessarily the strongest guy, but usually an old guy that knows how to get younger guys.
* Even amongst chimpanzees, the alpha male builds his position not by violence, but by creating a good social order.
* In most societies in history, it was the lower classes who did the manual physical labor and were stronger physically.
* If all that counted was raw physical force, then Sapiens would find itself in the middle of the food chain. It’s the mental and social skills that allowed Sapiens to get to the top.
* So this theory doesn’t make sense.
The dominance of men over women results not from strength but from aggression
* Since men were aggressive, then they were more prone to incite war, and they used war to gain control of civil society as well, and they used this civil power to engender more and more wars.
* Men’s hormones make them predisposed to be more aggressive than women. Even if we accept these findings, it doesn’t follow that the ones who manage the war and who direct the war must also be men. In numerous societies, there was a huge gap between the top politicians and the soldiers. People who become soldiers do not become admirals and kings and noblemen.
* Usually, the aristocrats were educated from birth to fill the task of being a general or king. Even in Europe, the common soldiers were usually recruited from the poorest portions of society and from ethnic minorities, and the chances of a common soldier in the British army becoming a general was virtually zero.
* In order to manage an army and war, you need stamina, but you don’t need to be physically aggressive. Big wars are often a very complex project that require strategy and compromises, and the ability to make peace at home and to make alliances abroad is usually the most important ability.
* So muscle men are good as common soldiers, but you need someone who is cooperative, who can make alliances, who can manipulate people as people at the top, and women have always been considered to be better manipulators and empathic.
* So women, biologically, could actually have been good leaders, but why aren’t there many women who become leaders?
Through millions of years of evolution, men and women evolved different reproduction strategies.
* Men competed with each other to reproduce with the fertile women, and your ability to reproduce with women depended on yourself. So it was better to be competitive.
* A woman has no problem finding a man who would impregnate her, but since she needed to take care of babies/children, then she needed a man to provide for her.
* As time went by, the feminine genes that made it through the next generation favored the women who wanted to become good caretakers. So men have been programmed by millions of years of evolution to be competitive and to excel at competition, while women have been programmed to take care of their children and their husbands.
* Problem: This assumes that women need men to take care of them when they are pregnant (and not fellow women). This also assumes that it is male competitiveness that made them dominant. While they sound logical, they aren’t logical because the dynamics between competitive males and dependent females result in matriarchal societies.
* Female elephants have social networks to help each other (not men). The males spend much of their time fighting and competing, and their social skills and social bonds remain underdeveloped, and the result of this is that bonobos and elephants are controlled by strong networks of females.
* Even though Bonobo females are individually weaker than individual males, the females gang up on males if ever there is conflict.
* If women (biologically) knew how to make social networks, then why do males dominate over them?
Males have superior social skills?
* At the present, this question remains one of the biggest unsolved riddle of history.
* Understand that each of the societies and their worlds are different from each other. What happens when people who believe in their kind of imagined order meet people who believe in another kind of imagined order?
 
## 8.1: The Direction of History

* As opposed to wolf or chimp societies, Sapiens societies are very different from each other. Different human societies have different social orders and social hierarchies. How do these different societies interact with each other?
* Different interactions: war, trade, migration, missionaries.
* Does human history have a clear direction, or not? Yes, there is, and this is global unification of the world and humankind.
* Throughout history, we see that the small societies slowly combine to form bigger societies. This is a generalization though, because there is a perspective where it seems that united people become fragments (ex: Mongol Empire to fragments, Christianity to its different sects, Latin to its descendants).
* For most of history, Earth was a galaxy of separate worlds. There were no connections between humans in Europe and humans in America and humans in Australia.
* As we move on, though, the number of “worlds” became fewer and fewer. In 1492, close to 90% of the humans already lived in a single world, the world of Afro-Asia. Even before Columbus, a majority of us were already connected.
* The 10% of humanity that was disconnected was not broken up to thousands of separate worlds, they were concentrated in just four worlds.
Four Separate Worlds
* Meso-America
* Andean
* Australia
* Oceania/Pacific
The Current World
* Nearly everyone is connected already: oil hikes in the Middle East send ripples through the rest of the world.
* Everyone shares the same model of the nation-state, and most countries believe that people have the power the vote.
* Everyone has the same economic structures and ideas (capitalism).
* Even things such as how hospitals look, and the medical theories, and the techniques used to cure you, are the same. 
* The truth is, if we want “authentic culture” without external influences, then there are no more authentic cultures left, because every culture has been influenced by each other.
* Ex: Italian cuisine is famous for the tomato. Tomatoes came from Mexico 500 years ago. Switzerland is famous for the chocolate. Chocolate came from the Americas. Chili peppers in India came from Europe.
* We often associate the unification of the world is because of European imperialism and capitalism. This is just the final step of much older processes that began working thousands of years previously.
* The vision of unification of the world was in place as far back as 2000 years ago, which is weird because no species thinks of “the survival of the species”. Ants and chimps and lions only care about their particular social group.
* For us, it’s always “us vs. them”. In the first millennium BC, there were three orders that appeared, and people belonging in those orders thought of seeing the humans as “us”.
Orders
* Economic/monetary order
* Political/imperial: A single empire controlling the world.
* Religious: Universal religions, with all of humankind as their believers.
* So merchants, conquerors, and prophets, were the first people in history to transcend “us vs. them”, and get us to see the potential of the entire human race.
* Money is important: Even people who don’t believe in the same god, and the same king, are often willing to use the same money. Even if we don’t agree with other people, we still use the same money. Even in Bin Laden hated everything America, he still wanted American money.
 
## 8.2: The Direction of History 2

Hunter-gatherers started without money, with societies manufacturing everything. The economy was of favors and obligations. When there was something that you needed from outside the society, you did barter.

The appearance of cities and transportation (carts and boats) gave the people the opportunity to specialize. That’s when we had professional shoemakers and doctors and soldiers.

The villages also began to specialize: olive oil, or eggs, or something else. Each village can concentrate on the ideal crop for their location, and you can develop new techniques for the product.

A problem arose when you need to manage the exchange of goods and services between them. When you have a large number of specialists, favors don’t work because the specialists might never see the client again.

#### Problems with Barter

Barter won’t work because it only works when you exchange a limited amount of products. It can’t form the basis for a complex economy. We can’t calculate the prices of barter things. If there are 100 different commodities, then buyers and sellers need to memorize 450 exchange rates.

Even if you calculate the exchange rate, the barter is sometimes not possible, if one side of the exchange doesn’t need the trade to happen.

Money was created multiple times in history. This was no technological breakthrough; it was only mental and psychological. Money is not coins and not bank notes; it is anything that people are willing to use to represent the value of things. Ex: Kaury shells were used as money for 4000 years, in prison, cigarettes are considered as money.

#### Money

*The value of money depends only on the imagination of the people, not in the worth of the material that money is made of.*

More than 90% of the money today (there is about $500 trillion) exist only on computer screens and computer servers. “Printing money” means modifying files in the computer.

As long as people have no problem with using files as money, then we will use this system to facilitate complex markets.

Money enables people to determine the relative value of all goods and services of ¬¬things on the market.¬¬ This is because everyone wants money and can exchange using money.

Money is a universal method of exchange that allows people to convert almost anything into anything else. Essentially, you can exchange apples for shoes, or violence for education (soldier using his money for college), or health for justice (a physician can use her earnings to afford lawyers). A prostitute can actually sell sex for salvation; a prostitute can buy indulgences for the Catholic Church.

Money also allows someone to store large amounts of wealth. It’s easier to transfer gold than shells than apples.

## 8.3: The Direction of History 3

People are willing to work hard for a long time when they trust that the monetary system will work. Money is accordingly a system of human trust (in fact it is the most efficient trust system in human history).

We trust dollars because we trust God and the secretary of the treasury of the United States. This is why our financial systems are tied to political developments.

Sometimes we need currency that has intrinsic value and is not dependent on our imagination.

In Sumer, the money was cilas of barley, and everyone had a container for measuring it. It was easier to build trust in barley money because it has some sort of inherent value. But now, we can’t trust that other people would actually use this barley for living.

First currency with no inherent value: silver shekels (1 shekel is 8 g of silver metal, not coin). This is why we have jewelry (it doesn’t have any use in itself, but it used as a status symbol).

First coins: Lydia (modern west Turkey). The mark on the coin indicated how much precious metal each coin contained, and it also contained the authority who gave power to those coins.

Coins have advantages over the unmarked shekels: you don’t need to weight it every time you need to perform a transaction, and you aren’t going to be tricked by people who forges it.

The message is always the same: “I, the king, give you my word that this money has this amount of value, and fuck counterfeiters. This is why counterfeiting money is considered to be more harmful than other forms of cheating, because you are impersonating the king.

As long as people trust the integrity of the king, then they would trust the value of the emperor and his money.

In turn, the power of rulers lie in the people’s trust for money. It’s impossible to collect tax in the form of barley.

Money served an important part of humankind because the trust of money can cross political and geographical borders.

2000 years ago, the Indians had such strong confidence in the Roman Denarius that when the Indian kings created their own money, then they’d put the picture of the Roman emperor. In fact, the name Denarius led to the Dinar.

By the end of the colonial era, we just rely on trusting gold, silver, UK pound, and US dollar. This led to the unification of first Afro-Asia and then the world into one distinct economic sphere.
How did every human, when we have differences on every possible topic, agree on this shared belief in gold and silver?

Once trade connects areas to each other, supply and demand equalizes the value of every thing that is transferred with each other.

Even if you start off with no interest in gold, you begin getting it just because other cultures value it. Merchants would usually buy gold cheaply in India and sell it in the Mediterranean. Eventually demand (and value) of gold would increase in India and the demand/value of gold in the Med would decrease. The fact that Med likes gold causes Indians to like gold too.

Whereas religion and politics wants us to believe in something like in God, money doesn’t ask us to believe in anything in particular. Money simply asks us to believe that other people believe in something. “I believe that other people believe in the dollar.”

Money is the climax for human tolerance. Money is far more open-minded than any religion, any state, or any other social habits. It is the only system that can bridge all cultural gaps and does not discriminate in terms of age or gender or wealth.
2 Principles of Money

Universal convertibility: Turn anything into anything.

Universal trust: Any two people can cooperate on any project, as long as money is involved. Thus, money served as a bridge between different kingdoms and cultures.

Money isn’t enough to get people to trust each other without a state and a shared identity.
9.1: Imperial Visions

The unification of the world was driven by: money, empires, and religion.
Empire

Rules over a significant number of distinct peoples, each possessing a different cultural identity and a separate territory.

It has flexible borders and a potentially unlimited appetite. They can swallow and digest more and more nations and territories without altering their basic structure and identity.

An empire is defined only by these two characteristics, not by its form of government. It doesn’t need to be governed by a king. Ex: British Empire.

Empires are also not defined by their size: Athenian Empire and Aztec Empire are smaller than their modern-day country counterparts.

In the past, there were more different people than here today, and they occupied a smaller ground and population that the people today, and empires are responsible for having the transition from a big number of people to a small number of people.

The empires gradually obliterated the characteristics of the tiny people and they forged together to form groups.
 
Objections to Empires

Hearing the word “imperialist” is an insult; it is very bad to be an empire.

Why? Empires are inefficient and that they don’t work. It is said that in the long run, it is hard to rule over a large amount of people.

Empires are also “evil”, because they corrupt both the conquered people (no independence) and the conquerors. It is common to say that every person has a right to self-determination.
Counters to the Objections

Empires has been the world’s most common form of political organization of the past 2500 years. Most human beings on Earth have lived in empires and not in independent states.

Most empires have found it alarmingly easy to put down the rebellions of conquered people.

Empires collapse at the end not by internal revolt of the conquered, but because of external invasion or because of a split within the ruling elite.

Most conquered people never actually have a good future because they still remain a part of the empire.

When the empire did collapse, the conquered people just ceased to exist.

Empires usually give way to even other empires. Ex: the Middle East, from the 8th century BC to the 20th century, passed from one empire to the other. Assyrians, Babylonians, Romans, Germans…

Empires are evil? While it is true that building empires meant war, enslavement, deportation, and genocide, this does not mean that empires are pure evil.

Almost all of human culture is a product of the empire. Imperial elites use the profits of conquest to finance philosophy, art, justice, law, charity, etc. A huge part of the artistic masterpieces of humankind owe their existence to empires.

Even languages, most of us speak in the Imperial languages. The descendants of conquered people often identified as their conquerors’ races. We have English as our primary language because the English empire was the biggest in the world. 
9.2: Imperial Visions 2

How did the first empires and imperial ideas spread, and how did empires become players in history?

First empire: Akkadian Empire of Sargon the Conqueror (city: Kish). He managed to not only conquer the other city-states, but he also conquered territories outside of Mesopotamia.

Kyros of Persia: While the kings of Assyria remained as kings for Assyria, he claimed that he didn’t conquer the world, but he claimed that he was doing it for the sake of all the people. “We conquer you not for us, but for you, and my task is to care for everyone.” Imperial ideology, while hierarchical, recognized that all humans are responsible for each other.

This was adopted by Alexander the Great, the Muslims, the Indians, up to the USSR and USA empires.

This benevolent vision has justified the life of the empire for over 2000 years. This was able to get people to object resisting the empire.

The same idea arose in China, in Central America, in the Andes, etc. Empires with such universal aspirations have played a decisive part into uniting the many cultures of humankind into fewer and fewer cultures.

Under an empire, culture and technology spreads faster. The empires also deliberately spread ideas and behavior, which made it easier to rule over the people. It’s easier when everyone speaks the same language and has the same values.

Spreading a culture was also done to spread legitimacy. This is to spread their “superior culture”. Most imperial elites honestly believed that they were working for the good of the world.

Ex: In China, the ruling class thought that all the neighbors of China were miserable barbarians, and it was the duty of the Chinese empire to bring the best culture, the Han Chinese empire, to the rest of the Barbarians. Their mandate was given by the Chinese emperor in order to educate humanity.

Same with ancient Rome: They argue that they, the Romans, are bringing the benefits of justice to all these barbarians. The same with the Muslim caliphs (spread Islam), with the Spanish and Portuguese empires (spreading Christianity), with the British (they wanted to spread liberalism and free trade), with the Soviets (spread equality), and Americans (spread to third-world countries the benefits of democracy and human rights).
“We are conquering you for your own benefit.”

These involve a lot of hypocrisies, but in many cases, the empire was able to impose their beliefs.

Once the beliefs were extremely imposed, the conquered and the conquerors were amalgamated and there ceased to be a split. Ex: Roman Empire, after centuries, the conquered people spoke Latin, became citizens, and even became emperors.

The new citizens adopted Roman Imperial culture with such zest that the subject people still continued to uphold and develop the Imperial culture. Ex: Spaniards speak Spanish (a Latin dialect) and is primarily Roman Catholic (a Roman religion).

Arabs: When it was established, there was a difference between Arab Muslims and their non-Arabic, non-Muslim subjects (Mesopotamians, Iranians, Turks, etc.). As centuries passed, the conquered people adapted the culture of the Arabs.

The great success of the Arab Imperial projects is that the Imperial culture in the 7th century AD was adapted by so many people that even after the empire collapsed, the culture, religion, and language of the empire just gained more and more strength and continued to spread across the world.

Same with the Chinese, for more than 2000 years, the Chinese conquered a lot of groups, which eventually became Han Chinese. The ultimate achievement of the Chinese empire is that it is hard to see how it is an empire asides from the outlands of Tibet. Literally everyone in China has the same identity now.

The process of decolonization also follows a similar pattern: during the modern era, Europeans conquered much of planet Earth, claiming that they are doing it to spread a superior Western culture. Because the Europeans were so successful in spreading their culture, billions of people have adapted a significant part of that culture. People began to believe in: human rights, self-determination, liberalism, capitalism, communism, feminism, nationalism, all of which were invented in modern Europe.

During the 20th century, local groups of people that adapted Western values began to claim equality with their European conquerors in the name of the European values that were spread (“self-determination”, “human rights”).

The same with the Arab empire: the Syrians and Egyptians accepted Western culture for the most part.

The many values that people use to fight empires (“lack of human rights”) were actually spread by the empires themselves!

## 9.3: Imperial Visions 3

While it is tempting to divide history into “good guys vs. bad guys”, most of today’s cultures are based on imperial legacies. Even the very values which we use in order to criticize the empires are the legacies of the empires.

There are schools of thought that want to purge Imperial legacies and they want to reinstate “pure, authentic cultures”. *No such cultures exist today on Earth. All human cultures today are in part the legacies of empires and civilizations.*

Ex: India. Independent India is in many respects the child of the British empire. The British united hundreds of warring tribes and it created a shared national consciousness among the Indians. They also created or influenced the judicial system, railroad network, western democracy in its British form, cricket, the national drink (tea), and the English language that Indians use.

Even if you find someone who wanted to get rid of all of those things, then there would still be the Mughal empire, the Muslim conquerors, etc.

It’s hard to solve this thorny question of cultural inheritance, because we can’t divide the past into "good guys" and "bad guys", and most of our culture today is because of the bad guys.

As the 21st century begins, nationalism is fast losing ground. More and more people believe that all humankind, not particular nations are the source of human authority, and we should protect the interest of the entire human species, as opposed to the nation.

If true, then wouldn’t it be simpler for a single global government to enforce the rights of the states? No nation state by itself would solve things by itself.

Of the 200 states today, fewer and fewer of them are able to execute independent policies, declare war, and manage internal affairs, because the states are becoming more and more open to the interference of other bodies.

The new global empire would not be governed by a particular state or group, but it would be ruled by a multi-ethnic elite, held together not by ethnicity, but because of common interests.

When you look at the world today, the world is ran by a global caste of business people, engineers, academia, arts, and universities, which have increasingly have the same viewpoints and culture.

It doesn’t matter where you live, because you probably live in the same way. The divisions are no longer between nations, but between the castes. An engineer in New York shares more with an engineer in Delhi rather than someone in a poor neighborhood in New York.

More and more people ask themselves, “do I owe my loyalty to the state that I was born in, or do I owe my loyalty to the global caste and empire?”, and more often than not, people are taking the latter option.

## 10.1: The Law of Religion

Today, religion is a source of discrimination, but religion actually has a role in maintaining cohesion between groups. The crucial role of religion was to give superhuman legitimacy to the fragile roles and assert them.

Religion: “Our lives are not a product of a human caprice, but are ordained by a supreme authority.”

Religion: A system of human norms and values which is founded in the belief of a superhuman order.

#### Criteria
- Religion must believe in a supernatural order which is not a product of human whims and arguments.
	- Football is not a religion because everybody knows that human beings invented football themselves, and that FIFA may at any moment decide to change the rules of football. Since people know that rules can be changed, then this is not some superhuman order.
- It establishes norms and values which are derived from the superhuman order and are binding among people.
	- Even if you believe in the Theory of Relativity (which is not done by a human, and is superhuman), if you don’t derive norms and values, then it’s not a religion. It’s just a bunch of things that you believe.

#### Role in the Unification of Humankind

Most religions believe that there are rules which every human should follow, which are true for everybody, everywhere.

The majority of ancient religions were local and exclusive: norms and rules were formed for their locality, but they didn’t have any ambition to make other people follow their religion.

However, the missionary religions (Buddhism, Christianity, Islam) were a major unification force. 

Prior to monotheism, people believed in animism or polytheism.

Animism: The world is populated not just by humans, but by other beings as well, each with their own needs and personalities and desires. Humans must take into consideration the other beings of the world (ghosts and fairies and trees and rocks and demons and ghosts).

Polytheism: Polytheists believe in the same animist things, but they also believe in powerful entities called gods.

It is very unjust to stereotype polytheism as backwards. Polytheism doesn’t dispute a single big boy god, but they recognize the existence of a supreme god  (Greeks: Zeus, Hera answered to Fate, Hindus: Supreme god is Atma.).

What happens is that the supreme gods just don’t really care that much, because it doesn’t matter for them what happens to cities and people.

According to Hinduism, enlightenment is to view the world from the viewpoint of Atma, and that everything we do doesn’t really matter that much.

This is why the Polytheists approach the lower Gods (who have biases) for favors.

An implication is that polytheists are more tolerant of other religions, because they just say “okay, other religions have their own gods”. In history, polytheists didn’t kill infidels or convert conquered people to their own religions.

This is why it’s easy for the Romans to integrate Asian or European gods, but the Christians refused to accept the gods of the empire. To the Romans, it’s just a political thing. To the Christians, it’s a religious subversion thing.

In the 300 years from JC’s death to Constantine’s conversion to Christianity, there were just a few thousand Christian deaths.

## 10.2: The Law of Religion 2

While people can choose who or how many gods they would follow, eventually, some followers begin to think of their god as the only god and that god is the Supreme Being. They also believe that this god is concerned with the mundane details of life.

#### History of Monotheism
- Egypt Pharaoh Akhenaten declared that Aten was the only god. This wasn’t that successful, after he died the worship of Aten only was stopped.
- Judaism: The Supreme power of the universe’s concern was primarily with the Jews and the small land of Israel. So that’s why it’s still so marginal.
- Christianity: Started as a Jewish sect. It teaches that Jesus Christ is the long-awaited Messiah.
	- Paul of Tarsus reasoned that if the Supreme being incarnated himself on Earth and died on the cross, then everyone, not just Jews, should hear about this.
	- Because of this belief, Christians started to spread Christianity to basically everyone.
- Islam: In the 7th century, Islam started in Arabia, which then spread from the Atlantic to Indonesia.

*Generally, missionary religions are a bit more extreme. Monotheists could not reconcile two opposing gods. Oftentimes, to prove this, they waged wars.*

In some ways, polytheism and animism still lives on in the monotheist religions. It is not that easy to believe in just one god because Sapiens has a tendency to divide things according to “me vs. them”. Consequently, while there is just one god, Christians created the concept of saints, which protect each country, or each profession, or each disease (lol). Sometimes, people take the old god and turn them into Christians. For instance, the Irish god Brigid became St. Brigid.
 
#### Dualistic Religions

*Dualistic religions believe in the existence of two opposing powers: good vs. evil.*

Evil is an “independent power” that is not created by the good god, and the entire world is a battleground between the forces of good and evil.

*Dualism is very attractive because it answers the problem of evil and why there is so much evil and suffering in the world, and why good people suffer.*

For a monotheist, people have to make tricks to justify God allowing suffering in the world.

A common explanation is that God allows evil because he allows humans to exercise freedom of will.

Now, if God knew that a person would choose to do evil and suffer for eternity for it, why would he create that person anyway?

It’s hard to reconcile this, so Christians and Muslims and Jews need to create a devil. While it’s not logical (how can god be omnipotent if there is an evil), humans are known to believe in contradictions to make them feel better.

How do we reconcile order? We know that we can fight wars because we obey the physical laws of the universe. If Good and Evil fight, what (physical?) laws do they follow and who made these laws?

To solve the evil and order problem, it’s logical to actually create an evil god, to at least justify the evil in the world, but no one will believe that. Eventually, dualist religions were absorbed by monotheism.

## 10.3: The Law of Religion: Segment 3

There are religions which do not have gods. The gods that do exist are subject to the rules of humans and animals.

The Buddha thought that people suffer too much because of their anxieties. People pursue wealth and power and knowledge and possessions but are never content. When you get to death you lose every one of these.

Gautama thought that it is because the mind craves pleasure, and that is why it is always dissatisfied when it doesn’t have pleasure. It’s just the basic part of the mind.

Gautama says that if the mind just accepts things as they are, then there is peace. If you just feel sad when you are sad (without craving to get out of it), or if you just feel happy when you are happy (without craving to be more happy), then it is better for you.

Change perspectives from “what else should I be experiencing” to “what am I experiencing right now”. Gautama would rather that you didn’t steal or kill or be sexually promiscuous because you just get more cravings.

First principle of Buddhism: “Suffering exists, how do I get out of it”. It even allows gods, but these gods don’t have an influence on nature.

Even though the religion itself don’t subscribe to Gods, its followers still believe in Gods (Hindu and Shinto).

#### New religions (ideologies): Communism, capitalism, liberalism, nationalism, Nazism.

They are supernatural, they have their own books, they have their own holidays, and theologians. Ex: Communism provides you with a set of guidelines to how to live your life.

Compare “superhuman” vs. “supernatural”.

Ideologies are also like religions: they give legitimacy to human norms and values.

Dominant religion: humanism (the worship of humans).

## 10.4: The Law of Religion Segment 4

Humanism is the belief that Sapiens has a unique nature and is fundamentally different from all the other animals in nature, and this determines the meaning of everything in the universe. The supereme good is the good of the Sapiens. Humanists worship humanity, but they have different definitions of humanity.

*Liberal humanism:* Humanity is a quality of individual humans. The sacred nature of humanity resides in each and every individual Sapiens (liberty). According to liberalism, we should listen to our inner voice (the inner voice of humanity).  This inner voice = human rights. This is influenced from Christianity’s “everyone has a soul”.

*Socialism:* Humans are a collective. It seeks equality between all humans. Inequality is the worst blasphemy against the sanctity of humanity. When the rich have more comfortable lives than the poor, this means that we value money over the fundamental laws of the universe.

Evolutionary humanism: This was influenced by the theory of evolution. Ex: Nazism. The Nazis believed in the sanctity of humanity. They just took humanity to mean the Aryan race. Humankind is not something universal, but it is a species of animal that can evolve. _The best humans must be protected from genetic extinction._ According to the Nazis, the Sapiens had already divided into different race, and eventually different species.

This is complete BS. Biologists have since discovered that the differences between humans are too little. According to science, human behavior is based on natural stuff and whatever our DNA is.
 
## 11.1: The Discovery of Ignorance

The Scientific Revolution is the growth of the last 500 years because of the discovery of science. Nothing has ever happened like that before.

All in all, the lives of peasants were the same in the year 1000 and in the year 1500. But a person who lived in 1500 would feel that wtf is happening when they are transported to the 2000s.

Try explaining the Internet to someone who has never lived in modern times.

Humans all over the world invested little effort in scientific research because they doubted that they can affect things.

In the pre-modern world, “scholarship” was to preserve existing capabilities, and not to acquire new capabilities. A typical king would give money to priests and philosophers to maintain the status quo.

In the last 5 centuries, humans came to believe that they could get more powers by investing more resources in scientific research.

More power = more resources people are willing to put in even more research! Good feedback loop!

Science needs reinforcement from political and economic institutions. Scientific research provides new powers to help to the political and economic institutions.

In order to understand the scientific revolution, it is not enough to study science. You have to understand the bond between science, economics, and politics.

How is modern science different from all previous traditions of knowledge?

We want to figure out the bonds first. What makes modern science so unique from all previous traditions of knowledge?

#### Modern science differs from all traditions of knowledge in…

_It is willing to admit ignorance. It is based on “we do not know.” Modern science accepts that “the things that we think we know can still be proven wrong”. No idea and theory is considered bad._

In this sense, the SR has not been a revolution of knowledge, but the revolution of ignorance. The discovery that humans do not know answers to the most important questions.

Religions assert that everything that was important to the world is already known. They revealed what we need to know in our scripture and traditions. 
To religions, it is inconceivable that holy texts didn’t contain shit. To religions, if someone didn’t know about shit, then he would just ask the wise man and priest. If the priest didn’t know, then he’d ask the bishop, and the pope.

All people might be ignorant of things, because these things are unimportant. Whatever the great gods of the wise people did not tell us, it was unimportant. Ex: it’s pointless to ask the priest about how spiders spin webs, because it is unessential information.

In every age, even in the most conservative ones, there were people who argue that there were important things of which nobody knew shit. But these homies were marginalized.

Modern day science welcome our ignorance about things that are very important. No scientist would be absolutist about “I know this, the end.” Even scientists today don’t have a problem saying “we don’t know consciousness” or “we don’t know the big bang” or “we don’t know quantum shit”.

The centrality of observation and mathematics: After admitting ignorance, scientists try to obtain new knowledge.

The third unique feature: it aims to acquire new powers. The real aim of modern science is not truth, it is power.

## 11.2: The Discovery of Ignorance

The first characteristic of science is its willingness to admit ignorance. Once ignorance is admitted, scientists collect new knowledge by collecting empirical observations.

Prior to science, knowledge was obtained through holy books. With science, we can use old knowledge, but we need to create new knowledge. Whenever present observation contradicts the past observations, we should favor the newer one, regardless of who discovered the past observation.

Earlier traditions of knowledge formulated their theories with stories. Modern science uses mathematics. Holy books do not have numbers and calculations because they were passed by narratives.

Newtons’ Principalia: A general theory of all movements in the world. It tried to explain all the movements of everything in the universe using the three laws of motion.

Psychologists: While not super exact, they use statistics, which is a part of mathematics.

Throughout history, mathematics was considered to be an esoteric discipline. Europe’s disciplines were in logic and rhetoric. Nobody in medieval Europe studied math, most study theology. Now, we are getting slowly to exact sciences (math and especially statistics).

The centrality of mathematics is one of the many reasons why people have a hard time understanding science. The human mind is not adapted to think of numbers.
Third Reason: Not truth, but power

The real test for knowledge is not truth, but utility. If something gives us the ability to make new things, then it’s useful. The relationship between science and technology, though, is a very recent phenomenon. Science and tech became connected only in the modern era.

Fact is most kings and bankers and merchants did not finance research in science and technology before. Rulers did finance universities, but these were only to support the existing order.

New technologies appeared in the pre-modern world because of the efforts of craftsmen with trial and error.

R&D was just non-existent at that point in time in all aspects of life (even military). Improvements were because of organizational improvements, not technologies. When civilizations met each other, prior to science, technology gaps did not arise from the king’s intents.

In fact, people like the Mongols conquered China even with less technology. The Roman army was only a fearsome army because of its organizational efficiency (not its technological strength).

Once science said that new knowledge can be translated to new power, people began to believe in progress, and this revolutionized the world.
 
## 11.3: Ignorance III

“If we follow the advice of the wise people (Jesus and Muhammand and Buddha) of the past, we can solve problems. However, we can’t solve some of the basic problems such as poverty and war, because Jesus and Muhammand and Buddha can’t.”

The notion that ordinary people can solve problems by themselves was ludacris at that time!

When people began to admit that “there are shit we don’t know”, progress seemed more likely.

As science began to solve one unsolvable problem after the other, humans began to believe that they can solve things by applying knowledge to it. Poverty and death are examples of ignorance.
Lightning: “Wrath of gods” => Franklin’s electric current theory => Lightning rod/”disarming the god”. Now, fuck you gods, you can’t punish us.
Poverty: “The world is imperfect.” => Poverty is now just a technical problem that can be solved. We just assume that policies based on the latest discoveries would solve this problem.

Social poverty: Big relative gap between the possibilities of the poor and the rich. Really hard to solve.

Biological poverty: The lives of indivduals are at risk immediately because of food (too few calories) and water. In many parts of the world, this doesn’t exist anymore and nobody is actually surviving to death, in fact more people are at risk of dying because of eating too much.
Death

What’s bigger than poverty: death. Before science, “death is an ultimate fate.” Traditional religions revolve around the idea of death. 

Even the first ever mythology, Gilgamesh, was about death (he refused to accept the death of his homie). When he saw that worms were crawling over the body of Enkidu, he wanted to defeat death. From these came the epics of Gilgamesh. He came home with the realization that death was inevitable.

True believers in science do not share the same values: death is not the inevitable destiny of humankind. It is a technical problem that needs to be solved.

“People die not because the gods decree shit. People die because of a technical difficulty (cancer, cardiac arrest). And we can solve this with medicine.” The best minds in the world are busy investigating how the body and DNA works and they are busy trying to find cures for all the diseases and old age themselves.

Until recently, you won’t hear scientists saying that they are trying to defeat death (maybe because the goal was too far away?). But now, we are at a point where scientists and doctors have this project to give humans eternal young life. This is the “Gilgamesh project.”

People are beginning to think that there would be amortal (you can still die, but your life can be extended without limit) people in 2050. While people don’t want to live forever, at least lives can be extended for 10-20 years.

Just think of the progress over the last 100 years, and it’s just mindblowing! Over the last century: 30 year life expectancy => 67 now => 80 for developed world. In fact it is expected that babies born today would live to be more than 100 years.

The new ideologies don’t even care about death (they are just technical problems). Sometimes, nationalism just promises that you would continue to live on in “the memory of the nation.” (Although admittedly, it’s not that much detailed.)

## 11.4: Ignorance 4

Modern science has caused people to believe immensely in progress. We just believe that people need to work on shit. But what governs the history of science is politics and economics.

This is because science is expensive and needs political and economic support.

The science that gets funded is what the politicians think is necessary, because we have limited resources. 

Questions such as “what is good” and “what is important” is not a science question, it is an ethical question, and science has no ability to answer ethical questions.

Ex: “Who should get the grant?” Grants are usually given to studies which have economic benefits.

Science is also unable to determine what should new knowledge be used for. Should we use genetics information to create superhumans or supercows? It depends on society and financial backers!

Two things that influence science: European Imperialism, Capitalism.

	## 12.1: The Marriage of Science and Empire

The Scientific Revolution was funded by ideologies. The ideology then uses the scientific discoveries for its own use. So ideologies push science in certain directions.

Europe’s rise was very surprising, because Europe was very poor before. Western Europe was never the center of any great empire (the Roman empire derived its power and wealth from N Africa and the M East, N Europe wasn’t even worth it to conquer).

Only at the end of the 15th century did Europe begin to become the center of economic and military developments.

Even in the 18th century, European states were still weaker than Asia. Europe just conquered the Americas because Asia did not exhibit interest. Asia: Ottomans, Sassanids, Mughals, Ming. At that point, China + India = 2/3 of the world’s economy.

Transfer from Europe to Asia: 1750-1850. 1950: Europe+US = more than ½ of GDP, China = 5% of GDP. 

Now, all humans are European in the way they think and they say stuff. Everyone views politics and economics and medicine and war through European eyes.

Technology gave Europeans a clear superiority over everybody else, but only after 1850. “Whatever happens, we have machine guns, and they don’t”.

In the year 1800, Europeans did not have a significant technological advantage over the Muslims/Indians/Chinese.
 
Why did the Industrial Revolution stuff spread to the other European countries, but not in Asia?

Europe has 10x the railroads of the rest of the world.

First railroad in Europe: 1830. 20 years later: 40,000 km of railroads.

First railroad in China: 1880, Iran: 1888.

Even if the other countries didn’t know how to build railroads, they could just have bought them from Europe and engineered them.

What Asia lacked was the political and social structures of Europe: US and France can catch up to Britain, whereas Asia had a different way of thinking.

In 1750, Europe may be equal with Asia in terms of economics, but it had a lot of potential, uncopyable by Asia.

These were: science and capitalism.

Even without a technological advantage over the other countries, Europe was already in a better position to take advantage of impeding technology.

Science can capital are still the keys for economic and political success in the world.
12.2: Marriage 2

While every country had technological innovations, Europeans checked out different parts of the world and brought them together.

Though Europe started the concept of science, it is now a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic endeavor.

Both conquerors and scientists began with admitting ignorance.

Previously: conquerors thought they knew everything, and they were just looking for power and knowledge.

Europeans: conquerors looked to obtain knowledge (not just to conquer). Columbus/Magellan gained geographical information but also conquered. Every European expedition had scientists to discover stuff.
 
Scientific expeditions and imperialism were inseperable.

Cook expedition: 1778, had 10 scientists, including an astronomer and botanist. The Cook expedition brought back to Europe the first accounts of the South Pacific and the cultures there. This found the cure to scurvy.

Because the Cook expedition was funded by the Royal Navy, he also had political tilts, such as claiming Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific, and ruining the lives of Aboriginals and Maoris.

The Beagle was sent to South America to map its coastline. 22-year old Charles Darwin, a young Cambridge-educated geologist, went on board.

In the months leading to the expedition to the moon, the astronauts trained in the American desert. They met an Native American who asked to pass a native message to a holy spirit in the moon. When they figured out what the message was, the message was: “Dear sacred spirit of the moon, just don’t believe what they say, they will just take your land.”

## 12.3: Marriage


Science also paved the way for upgrading maps, and unfamiliar parts were monsters. There were no spaces.

After scientific revolution Europeans began to create maps with spaces, an admission of the lack of knowledge.

Columbus made the assumption that Japan was 7000 km west of Spain, but it was actually 22000 km. When Columbus reached the Bahamas, he thought that he was in Asia already (he called the natives Indians). He never actually thought that he discovered a completely new continent. They were basing stuff on the Bible and thought that it was impossible that the Bible just missed an entire continent.

Amerigo Vespucci: Between 1502 and 1504, two texts were produced in Europe. These texts argued that the new lands were not islands off China and Japan, but this was an entire continent. In 1507, a German mapmaker (Vandersmuller) created a new world map, the first map which had the Americas in there. Vandersmuller named the new continent after Amerigo (America).

This was the foundational event of the Scientific Revolution: it taught the Europeans to favor present observations over past traditions and sacred texts.

A 1529 map of the world showed America, with a huge empty space on the map. The maps admits that “we don’t know what’s out there” and invites people to figure out what’s there.

World empires: a new concept. Most empires just cared about lands near them. Ex: Romans needed 400 years to get from Rome to Britain via France. It didn’t occur to them to just go directly to Britain and conquer it.

Chinese expeditions (Zheng He with 300 ships) were just for exploration and were not rooted in Chinese culture, it was just that guy.

Europeans had an unparalleled ambition to explore and conquer unfamiliar lands. This was not due to lack of ability, but because of a lack of interest. (And why should China conquer Indonesia, or Rome conquer India, anyway?)

Early modern Europeans had this kind of madness to explore other lands and claim lands for their king. Asia didn’t even try to compete, even when they could easily buy shit anyway, and it continued to believe that the world revolves around Asia.

Even small countries such as Scotland and Denmark sent expeditions. The first time a non-European power sent an expedition was when Japan did it in WWII (towards Alaska).

Eventually, it was the new resources that the Europeans got from the Americas that made it possible to conquer Asia. Empires supported scientific exploration because they proved themselves useful.

At first, geography was the most important science and it gave Europeans results.

## 12.4: Marriage 4


Botanists and anthropologists studying the witch doctors in America figured out the solution to malaria, which allowed them to explore and invade Africa.

Contrast: When Muslims conquered India, they didn’t bring scientists, whereas the British brought anthropologists, zoologists, botanists, linguists, to better understand the ancient history of India. One of the discoveries: Indus Valley civilization. Prior to the British, nobody investigated these ruins.

Another example: Egyptians have been near hieroglyphics for so long, but nobody made a conscious effort to study hieroglyphics. It was the British, after 20 years of attempts, that a French scholar broke the code of the Rosetta stone.

European empires also liked science because it could give them ideological support (history, archaeology, and biology). These three fields gave them justification for European empires (racism).

Scientists really saw empires as bringing progress to the dark regions of the world. The empires bring new medicine and new transportation and new ideas to the primitve people.

On many occasions, what Europeans brought was war and exploitation and racism. Ex: British adopted a disastrous economic policy which resulted in the Bengal famine which resulted in 1/3 dying.

Due to the alliance with science, Europeans wielded so much power, and we can’t generalize what they did as good or evil. So it is very difficult to reach a clear decision whether they were good or bad.

## 14.1 The Capitalist Creed Segment 1

Understanding economic history and the rise of the Capitalist system is easy, just understand the word _growth_. The Capitalist economy is growing every year.

In 1500, the global production = $250 billion and $550 per capita per year. Today, $60 trillion and $8K per capita per year.

Banks have money because people put their money in the bank and there is double counting (ex: $1M in the bank and $2M of contractors accounts). According to U.S. law, banks can loan $10 for every $1 they actually possess. And actually, more than 90% of the money in the banks is not actually real (if everyone withdraws then the system falls).

What allows us to do this is our trust in the future. Banks trust that bakeries will be built, even without a single bread being made. Contractors trust that banks will return the money back, with interest. The entire economy is then based on the trust of the imaginary future. The secret of capitalism is that it finances present expenses with make-believe money that has no cover in the present and may have cover in the future.

For most of history, the economy was frozen. It hardly grew at all because people did not trust the future. People won't loan to other people, and everyone was trapped because you need money to start or expand a business.

The capitalist system is based on credit. People replace goods that don't exist at all with something called _credit_. If you convince the bank that your plan is sound, then you can get money from the bank. This is the way in which credit allows us to build on the present at the expense of the future.

The problem with the old era was not that they didn't understand what credit was, it's just that they didn't trust the future as much as we do. People in traditional societies did not believe in progress - they tended to believe that the present is the same or even better than the future. They believe that a bakery may rise but only if another bakery went down. The idea was that the economic pie of the world was of a given size. That's why many people (even up to now) believed that making a lot of money was bad (ex: Jesus).

Credit is the difference between the size of the economic pie today and the size of the economic pie tomorrow. Loans pre-capitalism were small, quick to repay, and high interest.

If you don't believe that the economy will grow, then it will definitely not grow.

## 14.2 The Capitalist Creed Segment 2

The idea of progress is built on the notion that if we admit our ignorance and we invest our resources on research was that things can actually improve! Whoever believes in progress believes that tech can increase the sum total of human wealth. If you believe in progress, you believe that the current economic pie can grow.

There were economic crises on the way, but over the long run, situations improve. Now, you have a ton of credit. The rising belief in progress and credit led to political revolutions. In 1776, Adam Smith produced _The Wealth of Nations_. Smith said that "when the owner of a factory has greater profits than what he needs to feed his family, he will employ more assistants in order to make more money, and the more employees he can employ". The people he employ can also get more money. 

Smith's claim that the selfish urge of "increased profit for me" has been super revolutionary, both financially and morally. "Greed is good and by becoming richer, you benefit everyone, not just yourself, and when you become egoist, you are actually becoming altruistic, and you help people around you".

Smith told us to not think of economics as a zero sum game, but think that if I am rich, then most probably, you are also rich, and if I am poor, then most probably, you are also poor because I can't buy your stuff.

Being rich means being a good person, and people become rich not by robbing other people, but by increasing the size of the pie. (Contrast this with Jesus' belief that rich people have a hard time getting to heaven.)

This only works, though, if the rich actually create jobs and factories, and not by wasting them. According to capitalism, profits must be reinvested in production, research, exploring new markets, but all the investments must somehow increase production and translate to profits in the future. The profits of production must always be reinvested in increasing production.

_Capital_ is different from wealth: capital is _money_, _goods_, and _resources_. Wealth is just unproductive stuff that gets buried into the ground. A pharaoh that buries his wealth is wealthy, but not be a capitalist. A worker that invests in the stock market is not wealthy, but he is a capitalist.

Elites in the middle ages did not believe in investment, but they believed in generosity and conspicuous consumption. They spent it on tournaments and wars that didn't increase the productivity of their estates.

In the modern area, the nobility was replaced by the new elite, whose members truly believed in the religion of capitalism. The new capitalist elite is composed of traders, stock brokers, industrialists, and members of the middle class.

Most rich people today, what they spend their days doing is rushing from one business meeting to the next, figuring out the best place to invest capital. Even if you don't have much money, but you think of where you invest stuff, you are thinking as a capitalist.

Today, capitalism is a religion. We have a set of teachings on how people should behave, and teach their children, and the principla maxim is that "Economic growth is the supreme good". Even if you want justice and political freedom , you have to get economic growth. When you want to improve a certain place, we always get "thriving middle class" and "economic growth" and "we need to educate tribesmen about hard work and self-reliance".

Even science is affected by capitalism, we first ask scientific projects "will this increase economic growth or not". Science projects which don't increase economic growth won't get funding.

Banks and governments print the money, but it is the scientists that need to foot the bill. So everyone wants to create money to boost economic growth, because no one wants the current financial systems to stop. And everyone just trusts the governments and banks, too, but ultimately, the only people that can fix everything are scientists. Hopefully, scientists can create profits from businesses and products and these can cover the credit that everyone is creating.

*Just remember that 90% of the money isn't real, and if we stop trusting the system, this money is gone.*

## 14.3: The Capitalist Creed Segment 3

Credit and capitalism were not unique to Europeans. Asian merchants have thought of these, however Asian nobles despised this. Asian nobles just taxed their subjects and looted their enemies.

The empires built by bankers and investors were able to beat empires built by kings because people want investing but hate taxation. Since Europeans financed their expeditions with credit, they were able to explore the world and conquer colonies. The money they got from the colonies allowed them to repay the loans.

Another major difference between the Europeans and the Asians was that the empires were financed by limited liability companies, as opposed to taxes. Since exploring the oceans were risky, the Europeans created the LLC and spread the risk among many investors. What you did was you set up a company, and set up stock exchanges to finance campaigns of exploration and conquest.

Consider the Netherlands. In order to secure their initially commercial interests, the VOC (Dutch company, not the Dutch state) conducted military campaigns in Indonesia. It was only in 1800 that the Dutch state assumed control of Indonesia. While VOC was operating in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indian Company created a colony (New Amsterdam) at the mouth of the Hudson River. In 1664, the British captured New Amsterdam and changed its name to New York.

The British also built their empire behind the back of private companies. The British East India company was used to rule over India, it's army was actually bigger than the British state. When Netherlands and Britain assimilated Indonesia and India, it was at a point where company officials were in the government already.

China wanted to stop the Opium cartels who were affecting their productivity. But since the British capitalists were major stockholders in the cartel, and Britain declared war on China in the name of free trade. In the peace treaty that ended the Opium War, the Chinese were forced to allow opium to be traded, paid damages, and gave up HK to the British.

This is why Credit ratings are much more important than natural resources. Credit ratings mean that the country can actually pay if it borrows money. This is why it doesn't matter that the richest countries don't have a lot of natural resources, they have very good credit ratings.

People who are called capitalists think that capital should influence politics, but politics should not interfere in capitalistic endeavors. When politics influence capitalism too much, you result in less growth. They think that it is better to keep taxes low so that capitalists can reinvest and create jobs as opposed to increase taxes so that the unemployed get benefits. _"Just let the markets make the wise decisions by themselves."_

Free market advocates just hate whatever governments do: wars and social programs.

## 14.4: The Capitalist Creed Segment 4

In the extreme form, the belief in the free market is just naive. There isn't such a thing as a market that is free of politics, because markets are powered by the trust in the future, and it is the political system that regulate thievery and the markets themselves.

If markets are not regulated, then there is a possibility that the powerful members can abuse the weaker ones. The excuse was: *"A really free market would protect the weak"* because the best workers would leave for other companies and "his own greed would treat his workers well". In a completely free market, greedy factory owners can establish monopolies, and they all owners can control the workforce (they can choose to just keep all wages low).

At the end of the Middle Ages, slavery was non-existent, but when the Europeans crossed the Atlantic, slaves were present. This was not because of tyrants, but because of economic enterprise (law and demand). People invested money in the slave companies because it was good business (!), there were profits of 6% per year.

This is the real problem of a completely free market system, it cannot be sure that profits are done in the correct way. Capitalism killed millions of people not because of hatred but only because of indifference. People who bought the shares didn't even think of the Africans, they just thought of the money. Many of them lived far away from the plantation and they just cared about the plantation's profits.

The end result is that although it is true that the economic pie kept growing, the distribution of wealth was so uneven, in such a way that Africans and Indonesians and Indians actually ate less than their ancestors 500 years ago. Capitalists argue that the only way of managing the world is just capitalism (communism sucked big time). We may not like capitalism, but we cannot live without it, because there is no other idea that can come close to it.

Another answer is that we need to be a little bit patient, and that paradise is just around the corner. We just have to wait a little longer, and everyone in the end will receive a bigger slice of the pie.

We could also argue that life expectancy, child mortality, and calories per person is significantly higher in 2013 versus 1913, even though there are many people around. The only question is, can the economic pie continue to grow?

## 15.1: The Industrial Revolution Segment 1

What will happen when we don't have raw materials (oil, iron, copper) anymore?

When we look back in history over the last 2-3 centuries, the danger of humanity running out of raw materials is smaller than at first sight. The amount of raw materials just kept growing, instead of diminishing.

Whenever there is a threat of a shortage of energy or raw materials, investments begin to flow into science to solve this. Because of this financial support, the scientists/engineers are able to solve these problems and find alternate sources. What is lacking is not energy, but ways to harness it.

Steam engine: The first big invention of the IR. You burn fuel (coal) and you use the resulting heat to boil water. The resultant steam expands pushes a piston, and the piston moves something. What is unintuitive is that you turn heat into movement. The piston brought water out of mines to prevent flooding and was used for looms in factories.

In 1825, a British engineer thought of connecting the steam engine to a wagon. This was the first train. In 1830, the first rail line was created, connecting Manchester and London. In 1850, Britain already had tens of thousands of kilometers of railway tracks.

This proved that you can convert energy from most any form to others. Once people discovered this, they were able to invent a lot of things. Ex: It took just 40 years from e=mc2 to atomic bombs. E=mc2 just means that any amount of matter can be converted to huge amounts of energy.

The internal combustion engine turned petroleum into liquid political power. While petroleum had been known for thousands of years, people didn't do anything with it, they just used it for waterproofing ships and lubricating axles.

People knew about electricity, but it didn't have any use in the army. It was used by scientists and magicians. Now, we can't imagine our lives without electricity.

The IR is a revolution around energy. It says that there is no limit to what we can do because of the energy we have. The amount that we are using is negligible to the energy that the sun releases every day, the nuclear power inside atoms, and gravitational energy.

Prior to the IR, all of our energy was taken from plants (food, animal food, heating wood). Throughout most of history, we just spent whatever energy plants from the sun (which is very small).

But what about raw materials? Once we solve the problem of energy, we can solve the problem of raw materials because we can then extract and transport raw materials from anywhere. Ex: We are able to get raw materials from other countries because of cheaper transportation costs.

## 15.2: The Industrial Revolution Segment 2

The IR first and formost affected agriculture and the methods for creating food. Machines such as tractors began to do work that was done by muscle work by humans and animals. Even animals became machines. Farm animals became mass-produced in factory-like facilities and their existences are determined by the profits and losses of the businesses that own them. The industry had no intrinsic interest on the social and psychological needs of animals unless these affect their productivity.

Ex: Hens are in cages that are so small that they can't even flap their wings and do their socializing. Male chicks and infertile female chicks are taken away and are shredded or thrown in the garbage. In industrial pig farms, pigs and sows are confined in very small cages that they literally aren't able to turn around.

Note that people don't really hate animals, it's just that it is more efficient, production wise. What's ironic is that we now know that mammals and birds really have psychological/social needs and feelings. Evolution implanted cows with desires to play and bond with their mothers. Now, farmers separate young cows from their mothers, and the mothers are fed and inseminated. While industrial agriculture takes care of farm animals objectively (they live), it doesn't take care subjectively.

Harlow's experiments in 1950 showed that infant monkeys prefer the clothed mother, although it sucked milk from the metal mother. It was not because of the heat: the metal mother had a light bulb in it. Monkeys look for more than material needs from the parent (emotional and psychological). Monkeys who had complete material needs but no emotional needs suffered from anxiety and found it hard to integrate with their society.

Prior to the IR, most people (about 90%) were peasants because most of the food produced fed the farmers and farm animals. Post-IR, just 2% of Americans work in agriculture but they are able to export food. Agriculture enabled people to stop working in the fields and move to the cities, and they were able to produce more products as a result.

When there are so many products, who is going to buy the excess stuff?

## 15.3: The Industrial Revolution Segment 3

You can't just produce stuff, you have to buy it.

Most people throughout history had to be frugal because there was so little stuff to go around, and a good person saved as much as possible.

Consumerism sees the consumption of more and more products and services as a good thing. Consumerism encourages people to treat themselves by eating too much, and it sees frugality as some kind of problem or psychological disorder. It has worked hard to convince people that indulging yourself is good for you, and frugality is self-oppression. "You should treat yourself! If you want something just go ahead and buy it!"

Consumerism has turned to turn segments of the population to be good consumers. Manufacturers design short-term goods just so we can purchase more and more stuff. Even religious festivals such as Christmas become shopping festivals. This results in a lot of obese people: the U.S. spends more on diets than the money required to feed every starving person in the world.

As in previous eras, there is a kind of division of labor between the elites and the masses. In ancient Europe, the aristocrats spent lavishly and the poor penny-pinch. Now, the rich take great care to manage their investments, and the less affluent go into debt buying stuff they don't need and afford.

## Rich: Invest. The Rest: Buy.

Whereas religions thought that people should restrain themselves to get into paradise. As a rule, people who follow religions don't really follow the rules of the religion. But in consumerism, people actually live up to the ideal that they are told. People are asked to spend paradise on earth, and if they aren't happy enough, they just need to spend more.

## 16.1: A Permanent Revolution Segment 1

If you took all of the 7 billion people of the world and put them on a scale, we come up with 3 million tons. All of our livestock is 7 million tons. All of the big wild animals (oceans/continents) would be less than 1 million tons.

Giraffes: 80K. Gray wolves: 200K (dogs (400M)). Chimps: 250K.

We will most probably just get more resources (previous segment). The more justified fear is the fear that we will destroy our environment. 

As humans gain the power to control the forces of nature, we might get side effects. In order to stop these, we have to take even more drastic actions/manipulations of the ecosystem and it will cause more problems.

Don't think that we are "destroying" nature. Nature as such cannot be destroyed. It can only be changed. The asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs just changed the environment which allowed mammals to flourish. In the same way, we might be just changing the earth to make it more suitable for other animals such as rats and cockroaches.

Over the last 200 years, the human population has been growing super huge!

- 1700: 700M
- 1900: 1.5B
- 2000: 6B
- Today: 7B

The rhythms of agriculture have changed with the increase of industry. Traditional agriculture depended on organic growth. Most societies relied not on clocks, but on the changes seen in nature and seasons.

Modern industry relies not on nature, but on the precise schedules which are constant throughout the year. As opposed to a middle-aged shoemaker who makes an entire shoe, today's shoe factories have a huge division of labor.

Because each worker has to be there, everyone goes to work at the same time, eats lunch at the same time, and goes home at the same time. The IR has turned the timetable into the basis for all human activities.

After factories began to impose timetables, school timetables were also changed. Young children have to get used to working at the same time as adults. And prisons, hospitals, etc. timetables changed too.

Public transportation was also affected: trains and buses have to reach factories before they open. So precise timetables for transportation were invented. (Note: There were different times for each city in England.)

In the 1800s, the train companies synchronized their times to the time in Greenwich. In 1847, the king made it so that Britain shared the same time, synchronizing everyone's lives, a practice that continues up to today.

In the past, there was one clock tower per county, which was usually inaccurate. A family today has more clocks than a medieval county. And because everything is connected to these clocks, we look at them a few dozen times a day.

Every little thing we do: waking up, getting to work, going to the gym, watching our show, complaining about time, involves time.


## 16.2: A Permanent Revolution Segment 2

The most important change in human life was the collapse of the family and local community in favor for the market and the state. For most of history, even with the AR, people lived in families and community.

The IR managed to break these building blocks into atoms (individuals). Most of the traditional functions of communities were transformed to the state and market. Before, you work in a family business or a family farm. Your healthcare, your pensions, dealing with orphans, building a house, protection each other, all were given to you by your family.

These are different from the laws of supply and demand that govern our society today. Pre-IR, there were lots of sharing and helping, but not that much transactions (everyone had everything they needed). Probably < 10% were bought in the market. With very few exceptions, kings/sultans/monarchs did not intervene in the lives of normal families.

There were no mass welfare, education, and school systems back then, because there was no transportation/communication infrastructure back then. So local communities were left to manage taxation and police and other stuff by themselves. This is why family vendettas were used as opposed to a police or military force.

Ex: Ming Dynasty Baoching. 10 families in a ching, 10 chings in a Bao. If someone in the Bao committed a crime, others can be punished. Taxes are levied on the Bao, not the individuals. It's the responsibility of Bao leader to tax the families accordingly.

It wasn't all good. Family members could oppress in the same way as the states and markets today. A person who lost their family and community is as good as dead: no education, no protection, no healthcare. No policemen, social workers, state schools exist. You have to find quickly an alternative family. At best, kids who ran away from home would either be a servant, join the army, or be a prostitute.

When the government wanted to control the people, they discovered that the current family structure blocked what they wanted to happen. Parents and elders did not want their children to be indoctrinated for school. They did not want their children to be urban workers in the city. 

The state wanted to weaken the bond of the family. They sent policemen to stop vendettas and family violence. They convinced people to follow the fashions of the market, and not their families and tribes.

These were not enough. The state needed someone to work from inside to break the family. They approached people and asked them to become "individuals" and be free from their family and parents. Marry anyone, take the job you want, live anywhere you want, because you are not longer dependent on your family and community. The state and the market will take care of you: jobs, education, health, welfare, employment, pension.

The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual. We are treated as individuals: we pay our own taxes and we are punished alone.

Are people better off when they are free from the family but are subjected with the power of the state and the market? No matter what you think, it's amazing to think about how fast this changed within the last 200 years.

Today, it's the market that shapes our sexual and romantic fantasies. In traditional societies, the bride and the groom meet in the living rooms of families. Today, courting is done in bars and the Internet, and money passes to baristas, fashion designers, plastic surgeons, so we can look as close to the image of beauty planted by the market.

In the modern world, parents are asked to send their children to be educated by the state. The state has legitimacy to imprison the parents and transfer them to foster families.

In most traditional societies, parents could do anything they want with their children: murder, selling to slavers, marrying them off to a stranger. Today, the authority of the parents is diminishing. It has become a customary to view parents to serve their children. In the west, it's normal to blame the parents for anything going on with the parents. 

Ancient communities did not completely disappear. Since we evolved as communal creatures which needed a tribe, we still need these. In the modern parts of the world, the intimate communities were replaced by the communities of the market and the state. (A community is not friends on Facebook, they are people that you know a lot about, and your survival depends on them.) We have many communities out there, but we can survive without them.

Identification with the state is called _nationalism_. We don't associate ourselves with our families or tribes, we associate with our countries (which is weird since we don't know 99% of our countrymen).

We also identify with the market. We think of ourselves as members of _consumer tribes_: Madonna fans (CDs, shirts, tickets), Manchester United fans, vegetarians, environmentalists. Sometimes, they are more important that nationalism: a French vegetarian will more likely marry a German vegetarian as opposed to a French carnivore. 

## 16.3: A Permanent Revolution Segment 3

The changes of the IR have been so swift and so radical that they have changed the order so much! It's very rare to have swift changes in such as a short amount of time. People tend to reconcile themselves to the status quo because of the "this is how it's always has been".

When we speak of revolutions, we think we can pinpoint certain years of change, where in fact every year something changes and a revolution happens.

People become accustomed to change and we think that this is something that we can engineer and improve. Fact is in 20 years, the world will be a very different place. With this, as the pace of change increased, the level of violence decreased. It's lower than at any point in our history.

In the year 2000, war caused 310,000 deaths. Violent crimes killed 520,000. So in 2000, 830,000 people died from violence. While each of them is a life lost, from a macro perspective, it's just 1.5% of people that died that year, because 57M died that year.

In 2002, more people died of suicide than people dying from war. The fact is, people enjoy a level of security higher than anything our ancestors have ever thought. Most of us would never think of being murdered by villagers in the night. 500 years ago, even travelling across cities was feared because it was not unlikely that they would be robbed, murdered, or kidnapped for slavery.

The rising level of security is due to the rise of the power of the state. Throughout history, most violence was rooted between families. Even today, local crime is more dangerous than international wars. When states did not exist at all, and societies were organized by societies, violence societies were higher than today.

Today, in 100,000 people in Australia/Western Europe, just 1 is killed by another person. Even in Detroit, it's 50 in 100,000. In ancient times, we have about 400 people likely to be killed per year.

As kings, states, and markets became more powerful, violence dropped. Today, we just have 9 murders per year per 100,000, and most of these happen where states are weak (Somalia, Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico).

While there have been cases wherein the state killed its own people, these are not that high relative to the increased security.

At least since 1945, international violence has dropped even more quickly. The decline in international violence manifested in: relatively quick and peaceful collapse of European empires, and the independent countries that replaced these countries did not fight with each other.

What is unique about the collapse of the European empires was that it was relatively peaceful and orderly. Never before has been so much power been transferred from a group of people (Europeans) to another (Africans, Asians, Americans) as quickly. Ex, the British willingly transferred their power to the local elite, and a new country appeared without killing a lot of people. (It didn't happen in all cases, but in most cases.)

An even bigger change occured when the Soviet Union collapsed. Within 2 years, the empire disappeared in such an orderly manner. There wasn't any serious military defeat or civil disobedience (asides from Poland). The Soviets had the biggest army in the world, tens of thousands of tanks, and enough nuclear weapons to destroy humankind. What happened was the Soviets chose to dismantle the empire peacefully when they realized that Communism doesn't work. At the same time that the Soviets gave up the recent empire, they also gave up the lands taken by Russian Tzars (Ukraine, Kazakhstan, etc.) in the 18th-19th century.

## 16.4: A Permanent Revolution Segment 4

Fact is, since 1945, states no longer invade other states in order to swallow them up. Everyone took it for granted that the kings of another kingdom might invade or enslave or annex them. This doesn't happen anymore. Since 1945, no independent country, recognized by the UN has been conquered or wiped off the map.

Though international wars occur from time to time, they are no longer the norm that characterizes all the regions of the world. This is true not just of Europe; this characterizes many parts of the world. During the entire 20th century, South America had very little conflict: 1941 Peru-Ecuador, 1932-1933 Paraguay-Bolivia, and even 1884 Chile-Peru/Bolivia. The same with the Arab world: there's just one international war: the Iraqi invading Kuwait in 1990. Even in Muslim states, there's just one war: Iran-Iraq in the 1980s.

The argument against peace is that there might be a World War III waiting for us in the corner, as previous peace periods end up in wars. But the peace today is different from others: previously, "peace" just meant that there wasn't war. (There's always a chance of war anyway). *Now, "peace" means an impossibility of war.* It's unthinkable that a war would actually happen. For most countries today, there's a very low chance of actually having war. When presidents plan their budgets, they don't think about "war budget". It's not just that war doesn't happen, it's simply implausible.

While we may think this is naive, thinking about the future, it's quite remarkable that we can actually be this naive about what might happen.

## Contributions to Peace

* *The price of war has gone up dramatically.* There's just too much damage that can be caused by nuclear bombs.
* *While the price of war soared, the profits of war declined.* For most of history, wealth was material (gold, cows, mines). Today, wealth consists more of human capital, knowledge, and socio-economic structures. And because most wealth in the world today is knowledge, it's very difficult to conquer it and loot it and annex it. It's not even worth for China to invade Silicon Valley because SV's strength is its minds, and the minds will just book a flight outside. The places where international wars took place were fought where material wealth resides: Kuwait-Iraq and Iran-Iraq.
* *Peace has become more profitable than ever before.* In traditional agricultural economies, long-distance trade and foreign trade were sideshows. Peace just avoided the cost of war. In contrast, foreign investments and trade today are very important.
* *Many chiefs previously viewed wars as good.* Other elites hated it, but they just viewed it as a natural thing. Today, this is the first time in history that we are dominated by an elite that genuinely see war as evil and unavoidable.
* *Most countries don't wage war because they are no longer independent.* Some governments cannot conduct full-scale war on their own without the approval of the international community and international elites.

It's often distorting how much we see history with the events of the immediate past. But the late modern era is characterized not by war or by peace but by dynamism: history has still not made up its mind on what's going to happen. Despite all the amazing revolutions and inventions over the past few years, it's still difficult to know if people today are happier than people in ancient times. 

## 17.1: And They Lived Happily Ever After 1

Are we more happy than before? Has the 70,000 years of history made the world a better place to live in? Are we happier than the hunter gatherers that lived here tens of thousands of years ago? If no, then what is the point of inventing and discovering agriculture/empire/science/etc. if we are not happier than our ancestors? Historians seldom ask if people from a certain time period were happier than their ancestors.

View: We have much more power than our ancestors so we must be more happier than our ancestors. This view is not very convincing, because more power do not necessarily make life better and happier. Ex: Agricultural Revolution, more power but not necessarily more happines. Another ex: Spread of European empire: increased power of humans by circulating ideas, but these developments were hardly good news for the Africans, Native Americans, etc. who found themselves enslaved by Europeans.

Given the tendency of humans to misuse power, it seems naive to think there is direct line between power and happiness. Some critics of this view argue that there is a negative correlation between power and happiness. Power corrupts, and as humankind gained more and more power, it created a very cold, mechanistic view and we are out of touch with our inner hunter gatherer.

Third: No clear correlation between power and happiness. Medieval people might be more miserable than our ancestors, but in the last few centuries during the scientific revolution, humans have learned how to use their powers more wisely (medicine, decline in violence, disappearance of international wars, near elimination of large-scale famine). With the help of science, we have finally linked power and happiness.

These are all oversimplications. We are basing "modern age" on a very small sample of years. Medicine is just within the last 50 years. Child mortality/mass famines/international war have just been rare in the last century.

Even if the last few centuries have been good for us, we have seen the seeds of the future catastrophe (environmental destruction). So maybe we are experiencing very good years but we will be paying for them at a high price in the upcoming century.

We can only congratulate Sapiens if we think without the context of other animals. Other animal species have been subjected to massive suffering just for our global happiness.

Problem with the view: happiness is material. "If people are richer and healthier, then they are happier." Many of the greatest minds of humankind came to the conclusion that social/ethical/spiritual factors have as great an impact on our happiness. We cannot argue that our material possessions are greater than in the past, but it is not the only basis for happiness, maybe rich nations feel more alienation despite their prosperity.

## 17.2: And They Lived Happily Ever After 2

To know if we are happier, we need a definition and a way to measure it.

*Happiness is subjective well-being.* "I feel it inside myself." It is a sense of either immediate pleasure, or long-term contentment with the way my life is going.

If happiness is something that people feel inside them, how can scientists measure it?

The most important conclusion is that happiness does not depend on objective conditions of health or wealth or society, but it happens on the correlation between expectations and conditions. You are happy not because of your objective situation, but it's because your expectations are filled.

Getting a wagon when you expected a wagon makes you happier than getting a Fiat when you expected a Ferrari.

When things improve, expectations balloon. When things deteriorate, expectations are less. So people in the Middle Ages were not necessarily less happy than today (because they had different expectations than us).

It's hard because we put ourselves in their position, thinking "how would I feel like if I was in their position", which is wrong since we have a different expectation than them.

For us, just thinking about living without washing clothes makes us feel very uncomfortable, but medieval peasants felt differently about it. Pets don't take showers but it's okay to be intimate with them. We don't like humans who don't want to take a shower.

Fact is, taking a shower is not important to human beings until you get used to it. When you have an expectation, that's when you'd think it is important. If happiness is determined by expectations, then media and advertising is working to ensure that people won't become happier, because they expose us to better and better things which prevent us from thinking about happiness.

A teenager 5000 years ago hardly thought he looked "pretty hot" because he just knew the men in his village. A teenager today is far more likely that he doesn't look good enough or inadequate, because even if he is personally surrounded by more good looking people, he measures himself to the models or athletes. The body image of people today is lower than in the past. People are less satisfied with the way they look today than before.

The discontent in third world countries is not just because of whatever it is, but it is because of the standards of affluent nations. Ex: Even if the living conditions in Egypt were much better than any other era in history, Egyptians were dissatisfied because they compared themselves to their contemporaries in Europe and America. They expect to live like their people in America and were dissatisfied when Mubarak did not provide what they want.

*Happiness depends on expectations.*

Scholars studying happiness in the life sciences see that our happiness is not according to external factors, but it is determined by an internal biological system of nerves and neurons in the brain.

People are made happy by one thing: pleasant body sensations. A person jumps for joy not because of winning whatever, but he is reacting to the electrial signals in the brain. Unfortunately, our internal biochemical system is programmed by evolution to keep happiness levels relatively constant.

Happiness and misery only play a role in evolution only in that they encourage reproduction. Evolution has shaped us to be neither too miserable not to be too happy.

Evolution provides pleasant feelings to men who have sex with fertile females. If sex was not accompanied by pleasant sensations, then few males will bother with it. If evolution wanted happiness, then we would have orgasms that lasted forever. If orgasms lasted forever, then men would just die. So events can just temporarily increase or decrease our happiness, but in the long run, our happiness goes up or down on a constant basis.

Our "happiness system" is like an airconditioning system, we just go back to generally the same point. People have different biochemical systems: some are generally happy, and some are generally gloomy.

Most of us tend to believe that if they just get what they want, then they will be happy, but for the most part, things get back to the way they were even after events that make you happy. After you get what you want, then you just get back to normal.

History can chanage the external stimuli that can cause serotonin to be produced, but it cannot change the serotonin level itself. Ex: If you don't know the stimulus of what a penthouse is, then you won't know that it is better than a hut.

The French Revolution did a lot of things, but it did not change the makeup of the French brain. We'd think that every thing makes us happ

When we finally realize that the keys to our happiness is reliant on our own biological system, then we should focus on the things that can really make us happy, and that is our own biochemistry. If we can crack the code of our biochemistry, we can make people far more happier than anything before, better than any drug or whatever.

According to the biological approach, happiness can really only come from within. In Brave New World, Huxley envisioned a world in which happiness is the supreme value of society, and psychiatric drugs taht control and increase happiness levels replace police, elections, and government. And people took a drug, Soma, to keep them happy, all the time.

## 17.3: And They Lived Happily Ever After 3

Most readers feel that there is something wrong with that kind of world, but it is hard to say what, because everyone is so happy, what's wrong with it.

In Huxley's world, happiness in biological terms simply as pleasure. But the dfinition of happines is pleasure, in our society, is not accepted by all scholars, or by all people.

To most women, they thought that taking care of their children (changing diapers, washing clothes, preparing food) was the least enjoyable part of the day. But they also say that their children are the source of happiness. It's hard to explain this discrepancy.

How do scholars interpret these results?

- People don't really know what's good for them. They think that one thing is the source of their happiness, perhaps because society told them that this is what the source of happiness is, but it's not true.
- Happiness is something different from pleasure. Happiness is not the surplus of pleasant moments over unpleasant moments. Rather, happiness consists in seeing one's life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. 

There is a very important cognitive and ethical component to happiness: *our values is what makes the difference in the way that we see ourselves.* Our values makes a difference between seeing ourselves as miserable slaves to a baby dictator, and seeing ourselves as someone nurturing a new life. Activities in which you find meaning can be extremely satisfying. Even if they're not easy, even if they are hard, even if they are not joyful very much. Whereas a meaningless life, activites in which you don't find any meaning can be a terrible ordeal, even if it is very very comfortable.

If someone finds meaning in an ambition to climb the Everset, he may reflect on this chapter of his life as a very happy period. If someone does not find meaning in this, then they would think that the climb is a terrible ordeal. 

*Because happiness isn't comfort. And happiness isn't pleasure. Happiness above all if finding meaning in what we do, even if what we do involved a lot of hardships and difficulties. And it's not rosy and joyful all of the time.*

People in all cultures and eras have felt the same type of pleasant and unpleasant sensations in their body. But the meaning that people gave to their experiences might have been different in different cultures and periods of history. If you look at life on a minute-by-minute basis, then certainly life in the middle ages for most peopel was much more hard, much more difficult, much less comfortable than life is today at least for people in affluent societies. However, if happiness depends on meaning, then still, Medieval people could have been more happier than people today in affluent societies.

Medieval people could find meaning to everything that happens in their lives, in the promise of everlasting bliss in the afterlife. And of their being part of this huge cosmic plan of God, it might be difficult, but it's so full of meaning.

The problem with giving importance to meaning is that according to science, humans are just the outcome of blind evolutionay processes that operate without any purpose: without any goal, without any meaning, our actions, our lives are not part of some divine cosmic plan. And according to modern science today, the meaning that people ascribe to their lives and their decisions and thier actions is simply a delusion. We think we have meaning, but we don't. 

Everything: religion, capitalism, nationalism, don't have meanings. Scientists say "my life is meaningful because I will increase the store of human knowledge." A businessman says that "my life is meaningful because I'm building a new and successful company." But these are all delusions. What happens is that our personal delusions are in sync with the personal elusions of others, and hopefully we can convince ourselves that our life is meaningful, and we can find happiness and satisfaction.

This is pretty depresssing, but an alternative exists: the Buddhist view of happiness. Buddhism asks: "Given that suffering exists, how do I get liberated from suffering and enjoy happiness?" Buddhism shares the basic insight of the biological approach: happiness results from processes or caring within one's body, and not from events happening in the outside world. According to Buddhism, most people identify happiness with the pleasant sensations and feelings in their body, while identifying suffering with unpleasant feelings. People consequently ascribe immense importance to what they feel. People crave to experience more and more pleasures, while avoiding as much as possible, pain and unpleasnt felings.

The problem is that our feelings are no more than fleeting vibrations, changing every moment like the waves in the ocean. If five minutes ago, I felt very joyful, now those feelings from five minute ago are gone. And I might feel sad and dejected. So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them while constantly driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, they will be gone anyway.

So what is so important about obtaining such ephemeral prizes? Why struggle so hard throughout our lies to achieve something that disappears almost as soon as it arises? According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is not the feeling of pain, or the feeling of meaninglessness. It is the never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, of restlessness, and dissatisfaction. Because of this pursuit of pleasant feelings, our mind is never satisfied with reality as it is.

Even when we experience something pleasant, we aren't content. And because our mind fears that htis feeling might soon disappear, we crave that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering, not when they expereince this or that fleeting pleasure, but wwhen they understand the impermanent nature of all of their feelings.

So stop craving them and chasing them. In meditation, you're supposed to closely observe your own mind and body. To witness for yourself the ceaseless arising and passing of all your feelings, and thereby to realize how pointless it is, to chase after them, to pursue them. Adn when the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed.

You have to stop craving to have particular feelings, then you can accept whatever comes. You can accept whatever feelings that come, and the resulting serenity is so profund that people who go on living their lives can hardly even begin to imagine waht it is like to be out.

## 18.1: The End of Homo Sapiens

In the near future (next century or two), our species is going to disappear. We are probably one of the last generations of Homo sapiens. Our species will upgrade itself to a new type of being.

Over the last tens of thousands of years, the human brain and body has not changed, the people in the past experience the same things as today. This is why we find the same interest in the Bible, Plato, Confucius, because they were written by people just like you and me.

The next big revolution will transform the economy, society, etc., but it will also transform our body and our minds. It will develop a new kind of thinking.

The truly revolutionary potential of tech is to change people, not just the tools or the weapons, but the beings themselves.

#### Biological Engineering.

Any deliberate intervention on the biological level which is aimed to modify the capabilities/needs of an organism. Ex: Castration, oxen are less aggressive than bulls and they are easier to domesticate, eunuchs and castrati.

Now, we can use surgical treatments to not just castrate, but to change the sex of a man into a woman. 90s: Cow cell on the back of the mouse and it is shaped like a human ear. This is used to manufacture artificial ears or artificial structures.

30K years ago, people could imagine a human/lion hybrid and they can make an ivory statue of such a creature. Today, humans are actually able to create half-half hybrids. Ex: frost-resistant potatoes, disease-resistant cows, genius mice.

Gap is in ethical and political objections, not technical. We might end up with indefinite life spans, living forever.

## 18.2: The End of Homo Sapiens 2

#### Cyborgs

Cyborgs are beings that combine organic and inorganic parts, such as a human with bionic hands. In a sense, all of us are cyborgs these days, since our natural senses and functions are supplemented, improved by devices; such as eyeglasses and pacemakers and computers.

In the near future, this process is likely to go much, much further.

We already have functioning prototypes of bionic ears, which enable deaf people to hear again. The same can be done with bionic noses, arms, and legs. Bionic arms are operated by thought alone.

There's no reason to think that these limbs need to be connected or even be in the same room, continent, or planet. Scientists at Duke have recently demonstrated this with rhesus monkeys. A monkey, called Aurora, learned how to control only with her mind, a detached bionic arm while simultaneously moving her two organic arms. Adoya, another rhesus monkey, becamse famous in 2008 when she thought-controlled a pair of bionic legs which were positioned in Japan from North Carolina.

The most revolutionary of the projects is the attempt to create a two-way brain computer interface, that will allow computers to read the electrical signals of the human brain while simultaneously transmitting signals that the brain can read and interpret and understand. You can connect to the Internet (or Interbrain net) with your mind, or you can access the memories of other people.

#### Engineering non-organic beings

The most obvious example is an independent learning program. A prototype of such a program already exists, and it is called a computer virus.

Philosophical questions: Is this thing alive? If you back yourself up on a computer and destroy the computer, can you be charged with murder?

## 18.3: The End of Homo Sapiens 3

Bioengineering raises a lot of issues with privacy and identity and health care and equality. What happens to pension funds and labor organizations when 60 is the new 30?

Personalized DNA mapping/testing opens the way to personalized medicine. What happens to insurance and job applications? Would your boss ask you to fax your DNA instead of your CV? Can you sue for gender discrimination?

Our modern world today prides itself on recognizing the basic equality of all humans. But we might be poised to create the most unequal society that ever existed on Earth.

Throughtut history, the upper classes always claimed that they are smarter, stronger, and better than the under class. Previously, a baby born to a peasant family was likely to be as intelligent as the crowned prince or son of the king. However, today, with the help of new medical and scientific capabilites, the pretensions of the upper classes might become an objective reality. They may really be smarter and stronger thatn the underclasses and everybody else. And this is not science fiction, this is science.

Science fiction describes a world in which sapiens identical to you and me enjoy superior technology, such as spaceships or laser guns, but thre real potential of future technology is to change not the spaceships, but the Sapiens themselves. And Sci-fi rarely describes such a future because an accurate description is incomprehensible to people today.

It should be emphasized that the future masters of the world will be more different from us than we are different from the Neanderthals. These future beings are going to be god-like, and inorganic, at least in parts of their bodies.

#### The Singularity

The singularity is a point in which our world of meaning collapses completely. It is a point in which our world of meaning collapses completely. A point when everything we know about ourselves and about the world will become irrelevant. We cannot imagine this point or anything happening after this point.

Physicists define the Big Bang as a singularity. The Big Bang was a point when all known natural laws, including space and time, did not exist and did not function in any way that we can understand using our current models and knowledge. Anything that happened beore the Big Bang is meaningless to us. It is meaningless to speak about things happening before the Big Bang because there was no time.

We may be approaching another future point of singularity in which our known world of meaning wil collapse. The pace of technological development is so rapid that we will soon come to the point when Homo sapiesn is replaced by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques but also different cognitive and emotional abilities and experiences. They might look at us someday as we look onto the Neanderthals.

But this is just speculation. History teaches us that what seems to be inevitable and just around the corner may never materialize due to all kinds of unforeseen barriers, and other scenarios which nobody foresaw will actually happen. With Sputnik, people forecasted that people in the year 2000 would live on the moon or on Mars. Hiroshima and Nagasaki led people to think about the nuclear world of 2000. But we don't live in those realities.

So take the basic idea that the next stage of history will include not only technological and organizational transfomration, but also fundamental revolutions in human consciousness and identity. Will it happen in 2050, or two centuries from now? The most important question facing humankind today is what do we want to become? In what way do we want to enhance humankind? When asked these questions, most of the debates today (religions, classes, economic organization) feel petty.

## Q&A, Part 1 and 2

*What school of thought are you advocating, so that I can learn more about its development?*

A: A lot, but I think my approach can be described as bio-global. Bio-global means giving a lot of importance to biology/biological factors when looking at history. And I look at the totalitive history and the totalitive humankind. The little issues are important, because we need them for the big issues. But a defect of historical research in the 2nd half of the 20th century was that people were afraid of asking big questiosn and of creating big narratives of history.

*Would you consider the Internet as the 4th pillar of human unification in addition to money and empires, and religion?*

The Internet certainly represents the final stage of human unification. Today, the world is a single ecological, political, and cultural unit. Internet has certainly strengthened this process. But we should realize that the Internet is basically a technology, a tool. But we needed to link economics, politics, and religion first. Now, I can buy from Amazon, because all the currencies of the world are interlinked. I speak to you in English, not my mother tongue, because of British and American Imperialism. And the Internet communication is basd on liberal humanism: everybody has the right to their own opinion and to voice their own opinions and so on and so forth.

*What are the lessons that humankind should learn from history?*

People sometimes have this idea that we learn history in order to understand the past mistakes. But it doesn't teach us much in that regard because we are in a different position from them 100 years ago or 500 years ago. There's so many differences with what's happening now and in the First World War, or the ancient world.

The real purpose of history is not to learn lessons but to free ourselves fromthe grip of the past. What happens is that people, societies, have a very difficult time understanding the present as it really is, because the past doesn't allow us to see things clearly. We think that the capitalist system is natural and inevitable, but it's not natural and it's not inevitable, it's just the outcome of historical process of all kinds of events happening one after the other until they lead to the present situation.

The real purpose of history is to understand. There is a chain of events that cause the world to be as it is now, and why we see the world in a certain way. You get to think that "there is not just one way of seeing the economy." And this allows you to see many more things, and you're able to see the present more clearly.

*Could you elaborate more on the laws in history?*

When i speak about laws in history, these aren't physical laws. I mean things you can generalize about history. Think generalizations, now laws. Ex: Luxuries become necessities. Another Ex: For people, it's bvery difficult for a society to create, and think about, a completely harmonious world view. In any society, it's extremely likely that people in that society have contradictory ideas. ANd that's the way human societies are built. *Humans have this amazing ability to hold contradictions, to believe in contradictory things at the same time and this is what enables those societies to function.* It's not really a law, but it's a generalization that holds true in many cases.

We should realize about these laws, is that because they are not really laws like in physics, they can sometimes change. Ex: The Law of the Jungle, we see war all the time, but in the 21st century, the law has been broken. There is no plausible scenario for war to occur between France/Germany, Brazil/Argentina, China/Japan. Even if the "laws" have been true for thousands of years, they may still change.
