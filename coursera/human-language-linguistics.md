### Human Language and Animal Communication Systems

- Difference between human and animals:
  - Discrete infinity. The alphabet is limited (26 characters for English), but you can make infinite number of words/sentences. Apes have a discrete set systems of goals, but they cannot combine.
  - Displacement. We can talk about things in the past, on the moon, or even completely abstract things. Bees: Can communicate about space, but it's limited. They can only talk about honey they have seen.
  - Joint attention/shared intentionality. Humans work together as a team. We have to read each others minds a little bit. Some apes have joint attention, but they don't work together in this very complicated way in which humans can do so.

### Human Language Vs Other "Languages"

- What's different between languages and "languages", like computer languages?
  - Human languages have native speakers. They learn about the thing when they are infants.
  - One can speak about basically everything in it.
  - It is carried and recognized by a more or less well-defined group of human beings as their language.
  - Sign language falls under this. There are different sign languages. They have the same functionality, there are native speakers.
- People without language:
  - "Wolf children": Grew up without parents or language.
  - Physical/psychological abuse, the girl who was locked up when she was 20 months old until the age of 13. No interaction, except her dad barked at her like a dog. She was not able to figure out this system of combining all these words into infinitely many sentences.
  - Aphasia: the (partial) loss of language abilities as a result of brain language.
- So how old is language?
  - Since language is abstract, we can't reconstruct language of 50K or 100K years ago.
  - **Continuity-based theories:** languages are based on animal communication.
  - **Discontinuity theories:** something happened to make human language possible.

### Discussion with Marten and Inge: Language Diversity

- Language is a communication system.
- Every generation has to learn a language, and language is complicated. So when children learn languages, they do so differently.
- Was there one ancestor language? We know for sure that we came from East Africa. So it's probable that the language spoken there was the ancestor language of everyone.
- Do constructed languages (Elvish, etc.) qualify as language?
  - They are usually produced by linguists.
  - No, because there are no native speakers. There are no infants that learn these languages, but if for some reason some adult spoke Elvish to their kids, it could be worth studying. But there's no community for Elvish? Haha.

### Language Diversity and Ethnologue

- About 6K-7K languages in the world.
- Some possible differences:
  - Number of vowel sounds.
  - Information in one word (Turkish) or short words (Vietnamese).
  - Terms that exist for one language but nor for the other.
  - Genders.
- Language families:
  - Things like sister languages. French/Italian (Romance), German/English (Germanic).
  - Romance/Germanic fall under the same language family (Indo-European).
  - Other families: Dravidian (S Asia, ex: Tamil), Niger-Congo (sub-Saharan Africa, ex: Swahili).
  - Languages with no relation: Basque.
- Why can languages be so similar?
  - Reasons of contact. Spoken in the same area, and people borrow words from each other. Ex: "Internet", because many words are in contact with English.
  - All human languages have a similar scheme because they're all spoken by humans.

### Discussion with Marten and Inge: What do Linguists Do?

- Library, studying old languages lol.
- Bush, like exploring.
- Closet,
- Laboratory, like for brain waves?
- Street, studying the way in which language is used in everyday life.

### Interview with Dr. Victoria Nyst

- There are different sign languages.

# Week 2

- Phonetics: Physical and physiological aspects of sounds
- Phonology: Sounds as part of language, though same letters ("man" vs "man").
- Sounds:
  - Are a finite set of 20-200 vowels and consonants.
  - A sound like "clapping the hands" is not used in speaking.
  - Sign languages have a finite number of building blocks, too.
- English language: "th" is a sound that doesn't have a letter.
  - International Phonetic Alphabet: All different sounds for all different languages. Clapping is not included.
- All languages distinguish between consonants and vowels.
  - Airstream is not impeded for vowels.
  - In many languages - Every syllable has a vowel, not a consonant.
- There are more consonants than letters!

## Production of speech sounds

- How are consonants articulated?
- Place of articulation - where in the mouth are you producing the sound?
  - Lips (labia) = `"Puh, buh, muh"`
  - Alveolar (where you put the tip of your tongue). `"Tuh, duh, nuh, luh"`. If you put your tongue
  - Velar (back part of the mouth): `"Kuh, guh, nah"`.
  - `"Ah"` - sound produced in the throat.
- Manner of articulation
  - Stop/plosive: When exhaling air, I can stop the air temporarily. `"Tuh, puh, kuh"`.
  - Fricative: Closing the mouth but not completely so air can get through. `"Suh, fuh"`.
  - Nasal sounds: using the nose - "`Muh, nuh, luh`".
  - Sonorant: Let the air go unimpeded: "`Lah, ruh`".
- Voicing
  - "T" vs "D" - T has vocal cord vibration, D has none.

## Consonants of World Languages

- Consonants that occur in all languages?
  - 2 good candidates: "M" and "T", because it's simple to make (put "T" at top of tongue, and "M" is easy to see).
  - This is why the sound "Mom" is so easy to make and it is one of the first words someone can say.
- Most consonants: South Africa - about 100-150 different sounds.
- Sets of vowels?
  - No. It's smaller.
  - Dutch has 13 vowels.
- Consonants look like there is different function than vowels - it is used to reveal meaning.
- Semitic language - you just need consonants to write sentences.
- Vowels - used more for grammars.
- There aren't much grammatical constructions.
- A, E, U are pretty much repeated in all languages.

## Sounds in systems

- Sounds are constituted of features.
- When a sound changes, a feature changes.
- Turkish:
  - `Kalip` - end of a word does not have a consonant.
  - `Kalib-a` - changed voicing.
- Even for languages like Hawaiian which have few consonants, there is an alignment of the consonants.
  - "K" and "T" are the same for Hawaiian.
- Path of acquisition/acquiring English: We start with "p" and "t".
  - People don't learn sounds, they learn manners of articulation.
- Interchanging sounds/speech errors:
  - "Brake fluid" vs "`blake fruid`".
  - "`Lemadon`" vs "Lebanon" - nasal change.
  - "Spaghetti" vs "`scagebi`".
- We have seen that place of articulation, manner of articulation, voicing are not just nice ways to describe the way we pronounce sounds, but they actually play a role in language as the atoms of language, which we call features.

## Sounds and language change

- We probably have different words, and also probably different sounds thousands of years ago. We might have different sets of consonants.
- How do we know if the consonants have changed? We don't have recordings of people hundreds of years ago, but we just think that is true?
- Evidence about how language sounded in the past:
  - Languages related to the language that you're studying. Ex: "Night" vs "Nacht". It could be that "Night" and "Nacht" were related before.
  - English spellings don't change, but the sounds more probably changed. By looking at spelling, we can most probably establish that English has one more consonant years ago.
- But WHY would the sound change?
  - Internally, a language changes its pronunciation over time.
  - Since children learn the language from their parents, they change it a bit (they are never perfect).
  - External (if the language comes in contact with another language). Example, if English person wants to say "Bach", instead of using the German consonant, they would attempt to replicate with "ch". People will get the closest sound in the table.
- Hawaiian word (few consonants, no T) for Christmas is very far from the actual Christmas word. `Kalikimaka`

## Interview

- Phonological acquisition - how do children acquire their sound?
  - Recognize the sound, and know which sounds are used where?
  - Early words sound far from how we do it: `guck` for "duck" etc. `boo` for "shoe". How do these deviations occur? Kids need to acquire the phonological grammar of their language, and they have to produce the word
  - Humans combine the sounds "k" "a" and "t" to make "cat".
  - You have to retrieve the words and the sounds. You should have stored them before in the memory, and you should have perceived those sounds before.
- What are the learning mechanisms that babies have?
- So if a kid got something wrong, where did they get it wrong?
  - Some errors are systematic.
  - Ex: the word "strike" can be pronounced as `tike` or `stike` because they haven't processed it yet.
- Why do people prefer sounds over sign languages? Maybe because we prefer to use language even if we don't see each other or something.

## Consonant Inventories

- The most important consideration in deciding on this set is to find groups of words which sound different from each other by the smallest degree sufficient to make them distinct words of the language.
- For example, the English one-syllable words pin, tin, kin, fin, thin, sin, shin are part of a set which differ by beginning in different ways, dim, din, ding, did, dig, dish are part of a set which differ by ending in different ways and pin, pen, pan, pun, pain, pine, pawn are part of a set which differ in the middle of the syllable.
- Several further decisions must be made, such as which consonants in different positions should be considered to be the same as each other. For example, speakers of English generally consider that words such as pip, tit, kick, bib, did, gig begin and end with the same consonant even though there are some easily recognizable differences between the sounds at the beginning and those at the end.
- For English, there is general agreement that the consonant inventory contains 24 consonants, though some linguists might decide there are one or two more or less than this.
- The range of resulting inventories extends from a low of 6 consonants to a high of 122. Rotokas (West Bougainville; Papua New Guinea) has only six consonants.
- !Xóõ (Southern Khoisan; Botswana) has 122 consonants, mainly because it has a very large number of different click sounds with which a word may begin.
- The more typical consonant inventory size is in the low twenties, with the mean for the 562 languages being 22.7, the modal value 22 and the median 21.
- Those with smaller than average consonant inventories predominate in the Pacific region (including New Guinea), in South America and in the eastern part of North America, with particular concentrations of “small” inventories in New Guinea and the Amazon basin.
-- Those with larger than average consonant inventories are particularly strongly represented in Africa, especially south of the equator, as well as in an area in the heart of the Eurasian landmass, but are most spectacularly concentrated in the northwest of North America.
  - The languages in this latter area belong to a number of different language families with no demonstrable genealogical relationship, including Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene, Salishan, Tsimshianic and Wakashan, among others.
  - There is no evidence that the predominance of large consonant inventories in this area is a consequence of direct borrowing of words between these languages although cultural contacts between the peoples concerned are in many cases intense and deep-rooted.

## Chapter Vowel Quality Inventories

- Vowels are the kinds of sounds that typically occur as the essential centers of syllables; in many languages the shortest possible word consists of just one vowel, as in the French word eau ‘water’, pronounced as the single vowel sound /o/.
- The English words seat, sit, sate, set, sat, sot, soot, suit show that English has at least 8 different vowel sounds. By considering further sets of words with other consonants, the full set of English vowels can be established (which will vary depending on the variety of English being considered).
- In many languages a vowel which is held for a longer time contrasts with a shorter version of the same vowel (or one similar enough to be considered basically equivalent). For example, in Tlingit (Na-Dene; Alaska), the word written t’a /t'a/ means ‘king salmon’, whereas t’aa /t'aː/ means ‘board, plank’.
- Diphthongs, such as the kinds of sounds heard between the consonants in the English words lied /laid/ and loud /laud/, involve movement of vowels from a starting position to a different finishing position. Again it is possible to consider such cases as single sounds with an inherent movement or to view them as the result of saying two different vowels in succession.
- **When vowel qualities are counted in this way in the sample of languages surveyed for this chapter, the average number of vowels in a language is just fractionally below 6. The smallest vowel quality inventory recorded is 2 and the largest 14.**
- Languages with small inventories are frequent in the Americas. The indigenous languages of the Americas quite often have four vowels in a set similar to that of Spanish except for missing an /u/-like vowel.

# Week 3

## Words and sentences

- Some languages like Turkish - words are very long.
- Chinese has short words.
- "Maria kills the cat."
  - Dutch: `Maria doodt de kat`.
  - `Apalai`: Jaguar kill they, father they.
- Morphology - studying the internal structures of words.
- Syntaxes: Study of sentence structure.
- What a word is in one language can be multiple words in another language.

## Morphology

- What does human language consist of?
  - "Words" like "the sun is shining"?
- How do you know "sun" is a word? Why is it four words?
- Criteria:
  - Spaces - A word is between spaces. This only works for written language (most languages, even English are spoken). Is "passion fruit" one word or two words? "Ice cream" - is that a word or two?
  - Meaning - A word is a meaningful concept. "Passion fruit" is a single concept. So what is "one concept"?
  - Pronunciation: A word is one form that cannot be interrupted.
    - Prosody - the way in which we pronounce words and sentences together.
    - Space between words is possible.
- "Uncovering"
  - `Un`  not a word (affix).
  - "Cover" - base.
  - `Ing` - not a word (affix).
  - Affixes and base = morphemes.
- Isolating languages - a word is exactly one morpheme.
  - Chinese - 1:1 morpheme and meaning.
- Agglutinative: A lot of morphemes, and they put the morphemes together. Turkish.
  - `el` - hand
  - `el-ler` - hands
  - `el-im` - my hand
  - `el-ler-im` - my hands.
- Fusional (Arabic)
  - Changes occur in the base as well. `kitab` - book. `kutub` - books. `katib` - writer.
- Poly-synthetic
  - Combine bases and affix endlessly.
  - Mohawk language: `wahonwatia'tawitsherhetkenhten` - this is an actual sentence.
- English is fusional, isolating, and agglutinative.
  - F - "sing sang sung"
  - I - affixes
  - A - The word "uncovering".

## Discussion

- Which languages have more words?
  - Maybe poly-synthetic since the existing words combine.
  - All languages can have a way to add and create new words, even though it seems like or it feels like these words
- Could you say that English, which has different concepts like Internet, which have different interests, can have more languages?
  - You could say that, but the smaller languages are very hard to pinpoint things to.
- How to know where the word boundaries are?
  - Really it's about being exposed to the word.
  - So how does a kid learn about where the word boundaries are?

## Syntax and word order

- Subject.
- Verb.
- Object.
- All of those orders (S-V-O, S-O-V, V-S-O) are in different human languages.
- Adjective-noun in English, noun-adjective in Spanish.
- Prepositions - Polish. Postpositions - Finnish. "Lisa with" vs "with Lisa".
- Typologists (study correlations in word orders).
  - There are tendencies for languages - `SVO` is usually `NA`.
  - `SOV` is usually `AN`.
- Question words
  - "What does John eat" - `SVO` moves to `OVS`.
