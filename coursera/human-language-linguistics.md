### Human Language and Animal Communication Systems

- Difference between human and animals:
  - Discrete infinity. The alphabet is limited (26 characters for English), but you can make infinite number of words/sentences. Apes have a discrete set systems of goals, but they cannot combine.
  - Displacement. We can talk about things in the past, on the moon, or even completely abstract things. Bees: Can communicate about space, but it's limited. They can only talk about honey they have seen.
  - Joint attention/shared intentionality. Humans work together as a team. We have to read each others minds a little bit. Some apes have joint attention, but they don't work together in this very complicated way in which humans can do so.

### Human Language Vs Other "Languages"

- What's different between languages and "languages", like computer languages?
  - Human languages have native speakers. They learn about the thing when they are infants.
  - One can speak about basically everything in it.
  - It is carried and recognized by a more or less well-defined group of human beings as their language.
  - Sign language falls under this. There are different sign languages. They have the same functionality, there are native speakers.
- People without language:
  - "Wolf children": Grew up without parents or language.
  - Physical/psychological abuse, the girl who was locked up when she was 20 months old until the age of 13. No interaction, except her dad barked at her like a dog. She was not able to figure out this system of combining all these words into infinitely many sentences.
  - Aphasia: the (partial) loss of language abilities as a result of brain language.
- So how old is language?
  - Since language is abstract, we can't reconstruct language of 50K or 100K years ago.
  - **Continuity-based theories:** languages are based on animal communication.
  - **Discontinuity theories:** something happened to make human language possible.

### Discussion with Marten and Inge: Language Diversity

- Language is a communication system.
- Every generation has to learn a language, and language is complicated. So when children learn languages, they do so differently.
- Was there one ancestor language? We know for sure that we came from East Africa. So it's probable that the language spoken there was the ancestor language of everyone.
- Do constructed languages (Elvish, etc.) qualify as language?
  - They are usually produced by linguists.
  - No, because there are no native speakers. There are no infants that learn these languages, but if for some reason some adult spoke Elvish to their kids, it could be worth studying. But there's no community for Elvish? Haha.

### Language Diversity and Ethnologue

- About 6K-7K languages in the world.
- Some possible differences:
  - Number of vowel sounds.
  - Information in one word (Turkish) or short words (Vietnamese).
  - Terms that exist for one language but nor for the other.
  - Genders.
- Language families:
  - Things like sister languages. French/Italian (Romance), German/English (Germanic).
  - Romance/Germanic fall under the same language family (Indo-European).
  - Other families: Dravidian (S Asia, ex: Tamil), Niger-Congo (sub-Saharan Africa, ex: Swahili).
  - Languages with no relation: Basque.
- Why can languages be so similar?
  - Reasons of contact. Spoken in the same area, and people borrow words from each other. Ex: "Internet", because many words are in contact with English.
  - All human languages have a similar scheme because they're all spoken by humans.

### Discussion with Marten and Inge: What do Linguists Do?

- Library, studying old languages lol.
- Bush, like exploring.
- Closet,
- Laboratory, like for brain waves?
- Street, studying the way in which language is used in everyday life.

### Interview with Dr. Victoria Nyst

- There are different sign languages.

# Week 2

- Phonetics: Physical and physiological aspects of sounds
- Phonology: Sounds as part of language, though same letters ("man" vs "man").
- Sounds:
  - Are a finite set of 20-200 vowels and consonants.
  - A sound like "clapping the hands" is not used in speaking.
  - Sign languages have a finite number of building blocks, too.
- English language: "th" is a sound that doesn't have a letter.
  - International Phonetic Alphabet: All different sounds for all different languages. Clapping is not included.
- All languages distinguish between consonants and vowels.
  - Airstream is not impeded for vowels.
  - In many languages - Every syllable has a vowel, not a consonant.
- There are more consonants than letters!

## Production of speech sounds

- How are consonants articulated?
- Place of articulation - where in the mouth are you producing the sound?
  - Lips (labia) = `"Puh, buh, muh"`
  - Alveolar (where you put the tip of your tongue). `"Tuh, duh, nuh, luh"`. If you put your tongue
  - Velar (back part of the mouth): `"Kuh, guh, nah"`.
  - `"Ah"` - sound produced in the throat.
- Manner of articulation
  - Stop/plosive: When exhaling air, I can stop the air temporarily. `"Tuh, puh, kuh"`.
  - Fricative: Closing the mouth but not completely so air can get through. `"Suh, fuh"`.
  - Nasal sounds: using the nose - "`Muh, nuh, luh`".
  - Sonorant: Let the air go unimpeded: "`Lah, ruh`".
- Voicing
  - "T" vs "D" - T has vocal cord vibration, D has none.

## Consonants of World Languages

- Consonants that occur in all languages?
  - 2 good candidates: "M" and "T", because it's simple to make (put "T" at top of tongue, and "M" is easy to see).
  - This is why the sound "Mom" is so easy to make and it is one of the first words someone can say.
- Most consonants: South Africa - about 100-150 different sounds.
- Sets of vowels?
  - No. It's smaller.
  - Dutch has 13 vowels.
- Consonants look like there is different function than vowels - it is used to reveal meaning.
- Semitic language - you just need consonants to write sentences.
- Vowels - used more for grammars.
- There aren't much grammatical constructions.
- A, E, U are pretty much repeated in all languages.

## Sounds in systems

- Sounds are constituted of features.
- When a sound changes, a feature changes.
- Turkish:
  - `Kalip` - end of a word does not have a consonant.
  - `Kalib-a` - changed voicing.
- Even for languages like Hawaiian which have few consonants, there is an alignment of the consonants.
  - "K" and "T" are the same for Hawaiian.
- Path of acquisition/acquiring English: We start with "p" and "t".
  - People don't learn sounds, they learn manners of articulation.
- Interchanging sounds/speech errors:
  - "Brake fluid" vs "`blake fruid`".
  - "`Lemadon`" vs "Lebanon" - nasal change.
  - "Spaghetti" vs "`scagebi`".
- We have seen that place of articulation, manner of articulation, voicing are not just nice ways to describe the way we pronounce sounds, but they actually play a role in language as the atoms of language, which we call features.
