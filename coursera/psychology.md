# Week 1

## History of Psychology
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology)

- Empiricism: Knowledge comes from experience.
- Even though human senses were fallible, the mind could be measured using the methods of science.
- Helmholtz: There is a psychological reality and a physical reality and that the two are not identical. (Sensory experience vs external reality).
- Wundt - 1875, experimental psychology in university. Self-reports to stimuli (introspection), elements of consciousness.
- Structuralism - where the mind is.
- America - William James - Functionalism - what the mind does.
- Cattell - mental abilities could be inherited and measured using mental tests. Identify those with superior intelligence.
- Gestalt psychology - the mind processes information simultaneously, rather than sequentially.
- Behaviorism - Through studying behaviours, the laws of learning could be derived, and that would promote and control behavior.
- Bartlett - constructive mind - people us their past experiences to construct frameworks to study new experiences.
- Binet - modern intelligence tests.
- Applied psychology - psychology for industry and engineering - designing kitchens, appliances.
- Psychology and society: Sex differences. Emotion did not influence women's decisions any more than men's. Menstruation did not negatively impact women's cognitive or motor abilities. Psychology of race and segregation.

## The Brain

- Phineas Gage - recovered from the accident. He was sort of okay, but his personality transformed (from efficient and capable to irreverent, profane).
- Astonishing Hypothesis - You  are just the behavior of a vast assembly of neurons, molecules. (Materialism)
- Dualism (vs Materialism) - Descartes believed that animals were material things, but humans are in part material and are in part psychological.
  - Argument 1: Humans are capable of capable and spontaneity of action. We are not machines that respond to the environment, our behavior is far complicated.
  - Argument 2: We don't feel like bodies. "I think, therefore I am". What do we know for sure? We can be wrong about the physical world (ex: The Matrix) or we might just be a brain in a vat. The only thing we can't doubt is that we are thinking.
- When you describe something, "my legs", "my arms" as if we own that body. We also think of body switching, body swaps. This is not a recent belief, this was in Kafka's Metamorphosis. Ex: being transformed into a pig, demonic possession. Minds without bodies like gods, angels.
  - This appeals to the survival or the self after the destruction of the body. You think of things like heaven/hell or reincarnation. The destruction of your body need not be the destruction of you. These all rest on the dualist perspective.

### Neurons

- The brain when you take it out of the head is just grey (red with blood). Roughly 100 billion in the human brain.
  - Sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons.
  - Neurons fire all or nothing. How does this work re: soft touch and hard touch? Neurons also code for intensity and frequency, not just "the presence of stimuli".
  - Psychopharmacology and drugs work by fiddling with the neurotransmitters - antagonistically or agonistically. Ex: curare (paralyzes motor neurons, can kill you if it paralyzes your heart), alcohol (inhibits parts of your brain), amphetamines (increases arousal), Prozac (increase dopamine and serotonin) to fight depression.
  - Clusters: the brain is resistant to damage, is extremely fast with parallel processing.

### Parts of the brain

- Subcortical structures/below the cortex.
  - Medulla: autonomic functions like heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, swallowing.
  - Cerebellum: balance, motor movements, mental/sensory tasks, automation of tasks.
  - Hypothalamus - hunger, thirst, sex, body temperature, regulation of functions.
- Cerebral cortex - fish don't have this, reptiles/amphibians have a small part of it.
  - Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe.
  - Things that are close in the brain are close in the body. How do we know which parts of the brain control what? We use MRI and check what damage to which parts of the brain affect people.
  - Apraxia: Unable to do an action - you can move your things but can't do the action.
  - Agnosia: Perception/can't recognize. Can describe the picture in parts but not what the picture is. Can't recognise faces.
  - Sensory neglect - you can block the left side of the world.
  - Aphasia - language.
  - Acquired psychopathy.
- This is an argument vs dualism.

## Our two brains/A bit of humility

- Left - written language, reasoning.
- Right brain - insight, imagination, art awareness.
- Right brain sees the left side of the world and vice-versa.
- Corpus callosum - what connects the left and the right side of the brain. It's actually quicker to see things on the right vs on the left, because there is a delay.
- Epilepsy - it's like an electrical storm in your brain. And when you cut the corpus callosum, it would be like you're two people (one can speak and one can't).
- If materialism is right, then there is no such thing as souls? If scientists are to speak honestly, it doesn't exist? To be humble about this, while the mind is a computer that can interpret quantitative and qualitative experiences, there is The Hard Problem of consciousness. The feeling of what things are cannot be simulated on a computer. Subjective experiences like "why do I feel this way given a sensory input". How do neurons give rise to feelings?
- So do we have morality, spirituality, free will?

## Readings - The Brain
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-brain)

- The brain uses 20% of the oxygen and calories we consume despite being just 2% of the total weight.
- If we have an abundance of brain fuel and neurons, how can we explain our limited cognitive abilities? Why can’t we do more at once? The most likely explanation is the way these neurons are wired up. We know, for instance, that many neurons in the visual cortex (the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information) are hooked up in such a way as to inhibit each other. When one neuron fires, it suppresses the firing of other nearby neurons.
- The two cerebral hemispheres can be further subdivided into four lobes: the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes.
  - Occipital lobe: vision.
  - Temporal lobe: auditory processing, memory, and multisensory integration (e.g., the convergence of vision and audition).
  - Parietal lobe: houses the somatosensory (body sensations) cortex and structures involved in visual attention, as well as multisensory convergence zones.
  - Frontal lobe: houses the motor cortex and structures involved in motor planning, language, judgment, and decision-making.
  - The frontal lobe is proportionally larger in humans than in any other animal.
- Split brain:
  - Because of the contralateral representation of sensory information, if an object is placed in only the left or only the right visual hemifield, then only the right or left hemisphere will see it.
  - Because language is very often localized in the left hemisphere, if we show the right hemisphere a picture and ask the patient what she saw, she will say she didn't see anything (because only the left hemisphere can speak and it didn't see anything).
  - However, we know that the right hemisphere sees the picture because if the patient is asked to press a button whenever she sees the image, the left hand (which is controlled by the right hemisphere) will respond despite the left hemisphere’s denial that anything was there.
- Grey vs white matter:
  - Gray matter is responsible for synthesizing proteins.
  - White matter - the axons of the neurons.
- Phrenology - the bumps in the skull affected the brain.

## Freud

- Freud affects everyday life. Freud was a cocaine and smoking addict.
- Penis envy: When a girl discovers that she doesn't have a penis, then she becomes closer to her father than her mother to compensate for the lack of a penis (Electra complex).
- His ideas - unconscious motivation (why do you feel and act in a way) and unconscious dynamics (conflict between the different systems in brain, like dreams, speech errors, jokes).
  - You might want to marry someone because of something else rather than "I love him". Freud says these motivations are unconscious.
  - Your unconscious is not a rational computer.
    - Id: animal part of ourself. Pleasure principle.
    - Ego: Understands reality and logic.
    - Superego: Internalisation of society's moral standards, and is responsible for guilt.
- Psychosexual stages:
  - Oral stage - the mouth is associated with sexual pleasure. This can mean they like eating or smoking.
  - Anal stage - anus is associated with pleasure, toilet training can lead to fixation. This can lead to someone being anal.
  - Phallic stage - pleasure in genitals. Excessive masculinity and the need for attention from females.
  - Latency - sexuality is repressed.
  - Genital - sexual feelings re-emerge.
- Repressed stuff - it spills out in dreams and in tongue. To repress these, you can have defense mechanisms.
  - Displacement - redirect shameful thoughts to more appropriate targets, like hating your dad becomes bullying another kid.
  - Sublimation - taking unacceptable desire to another activity - being mad and putting it to lifting weights.
  - Projection - attributing unacceptable impulse to someone else.
  - Rationalisation - reasoning away anxiety-producing thoughts - punishing kids "for their own good".
  - Regression - acting childish.
  - Reaction formation - replace threatening wishes with their opposites.
- Hysteria - "having amnesia to block things out". And when it's recovered, catharsis.
- So, which of his theories are really true?
  - Some of his theories aren't provable/falsifiable. Scientific theories can be proven wrong. If you can't falsify something, then it isn't science.
  - Very few of his claims have been correct. So why is he talked about? His grand idea of a dynamic unconscious is still intact.

## Thinking like a Psychological Scientist
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/thinking-like-a-psychological-scientist)

- Scientific theories:
  - Accurate - match real-world observations.
  - Consistent.
  - Scope - multiple data points.
  - Simplicity.
  - Fruitfulness - can make new testable relationships.
- Falsifiability - this distinguishes science from pseudoscience.
- Scientists aren't interested in what isn't, they want to know why things are the way they are.
- ***Because of these uncertainties, we do not say that a study—especially a single study—proves a hypothesis. Instead, we say the results of the study offer evidence in support of the hypothesis. Even if we tested this across 10 thousand or 100 thousand people we still could not use the word “proven” to describe this phenomenon. This is because inductive reasoning is based on probabilities. Probabilities are always a matter of degree; they may be extremely likely or unlikely.***
- Inductive - Given current observations vs historical patterns, this is what is going to happen.
- Deductive - given a general principle, if its truth applies to all circumstances, then is applies to this circumstance.

## B.F. Skinner

- Packaged ideas like the theory of behaviorism.
- Behaviorism
  - Emphasis on learning, no human nature. Any one is trainable to become any thing.
  - Anti-mentalism - Freud said crazy complex things, behaviorists said they want to do simple, observable science.
- Habituation - A decline in the tendency to familiar stimuli, due to repeated exposure. This is an adaptive mechanism to keep us focusing on new objects and events.
- Classical conditioning - Pavlov's dog - sometimes just the trigger (bell) without the food can make a dog salivate.
  - Before, start with neutral stimulus (bell) with no response.
  - During, add the neutral stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus (food).
  - At some point, just the neutral stimulus could cause the conditioned response.
  - Classical conditioning can create phobias.
  - Hunger reactions: Things like commercials or passing by restaurants can make you hungry.
  - Question: What's the optimal timing between conditioned and unconditioned stimulus? It's apparently if CS comes before the UCS, not at the same time.
- Instrumental/operant conditioning: The way you act in the world shapes your future actions.
  - Cats that practice can remember the actions that let it get its food. If an action brings a reward, that action gets stamped into the mind.
  - Positive vs negative reinforcement, and do it step by step.
  - Ex: training approximations of animal behavior to get the animal to learn things. Animals can work for poker chips.
  - Classical conditioning to associate patting with the head as a reward.
- Fixed ratio reinforcement (give reward after 100 times) and variable ratio reinforcement (like slot machine or social media).
- To make a behavior last, don't reinforce it all the time, reinforce it intermittently.
- Scientific assessment:
  - There are "innate" things, not everything is learned.
  - The way birds learn bird song is not the way humans learn singing.
  - Animals do get better at things, even without reinforcement and punishment. There is latent learning, which is learning without any sort of feedback.
  - Chomsky: There are things that you do without reinforcement. Skinner: Reinforcement is "you like it". Chomsky: So the purpose is so vague, that it doesn't make sense.

## Conditioning and Learning
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning)

- Pavlov's dog explains why people get anxious looking at a crowded bus, why the sound of a morning alarm is so hated, and even why we swear off certain foods we've only tried once.
- In humans, they associate a drug they've taken with the environment that they've taken in.
- Pavlov dog - not just salivation, but the secretion of gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and insulin also happen. For humans, even the feel of the couch in front of the TV can be a cue.
- Flavors associated with certain nutrients can become preferred without arousing awareness of the pairing.
- Erasing conditioned stimuli - this can happen if the CS is presented repeatedly without the US.
- Sometimes, the original learning can still go back. Even after you haven't seen a chalkboard for so long, seeing one once again can make you think about the agony of detention once again.
- Operant conditioning - the response always requires choosing one behavior over others - you go to the bar instead of staying at home and studying.
- **In general, a given reinforcer will be less reinforcing if there are many alternative reinforcers in the environment. For this reason, alcohol, sex, or drugs may be less powerful reinforcers if the person’s environment is full of other sources of reinforcement, such as achievement at work or love from family members.**
- Observational learning - this is like a child watching the behavior of other kids instead of asking the rules of the game.
- Social learning theory - those of higher status or authority can help reinforce learning in others.
- Parts of observational learning:
  - Attention - pay attention to what is observing in order to learn.
  - Retention
  - Initiation - can do it.
  - Must possess motivation to engage in observational learning.
- If an adult beats up a doll, children were more likely to behave aggressively towards the doll.
- If the adult receives punishment for being aggressive towards the doll, then the children would be less aggressive against it.

# Week 2

## Big questions about development

- Morality - are we "brutes" or are we "basically good"? Are we naturally prejudiced/racist? Our adult natures, are we set in stone when we were born? A 90-minute interview with 3 year olds do predict to some extent their future personalities.
- Knowledge
  - Empiricism - We start off empty and we learn and learn.
  - Nativism - Chomsky - We are born with rich powerful structural systems in our brain.
  - Constructivist - Constructivist - The idea of learning and interaction dealign with environment, makes us what we are.
- Piaget - was not really interested in children, but in the role of development in species.
  - Studying it by looking through children.
  - Schemas- there can be mental structures in the head, and these are frameworks that develop to help organise knowledge.
  - Assimilation: Taking new information and new experiences and matching it up with an already existing schema.
  - Accommodation: Existing schemas are changed, or new schemas are created, in order to fit the new information and new experience.

## Piaget's Developmental Stages

- Stage 1: Sensorimotor (ages 0-2).
  - Information gained through senses and motor actions.
  - The child perceives and manipulates but does not reason.
  - Object permanence is attained - "even if a ball is behind a screen, the ball continues to exist". This is why babies are amazed with peek-a-boo.
- Stage 2: Preoperational (2-7).
  - They can reason, but not at a high level.
  - Egocentrism - they literally cannot see the world from other eyes. A kid can draw 3 mountains, but they can't see how another person from the other side of the mountain draw it. "The way I see the world is how everyone sees it".
  - Lack of the concept of conservation - kids think when you pour water into a glass, they think there's more water now. They think that when you spread out M&Ms, there are more.
- Stage 3: Concrete operational (7-12).
  - Understands mental operations leading to increasingly logical thought - you can make some experiments/reason about things, they aren't common for them.
  - Less egocentric.
  - Inability to reason abstractly or hypothetically.
- Stage 4: Formal operational (12-adult).
  - Abstract/scientific reasoning.

## Scientific Evaluation

- He provided an interesting/falsifiable claim, and he had a rich theoretical framework. He also had striking findings.
- Limitation: Theoretical - what really does he mean when he says "development"? There's no "how" at a neurological, computational, and at a structural level.
- Limitation: methodological - children are not verbal, they are sensitive, so they'll say things to please an experimenter.

## Methods for studying infants/how are children different from adults?

- Brain scans.
- Sucking: Babies can suck - If the baby wants to suck their pacifier more if they hear their mother's voice or if they prefer their "native language".
- Looking: Babies can look. If you become bored, you don't want to look a things. Ex: if babies can distinguish colors, they they will perk up after you change the color of what they're looking at. Can they tell the difference between 2 things or 3 things?
  - We stare at things if they are surprising.
  - Babies do infer about the presence of things "behind an object".
  - Babies do get surprised if there is "something to block the thing behind it".
  - Babies can "add" and "subtract" - if you "add a toy" and it's supposed to happen, kids get bored. But if you do something else to change their perception, they stare at the thing more.
- Babies/morality - babies choose the "good puppet" about 70% of the time.
- From 4 1/2 to 5, kids can figure out that other people can think different things, they can deceive, they can trick, etc.
- Sally & Anne - kids can't figure out that people can believe things about the world that are false.
- The brain actually removes connections/prunes, it doesn't add.
- Parts of the brain are not fully developed until quite late in life (not in adolescence).
- Charlie can't unclench his mouth, but he can remove the finger with his hand.
- Open question - Are there are large scale changes between a kid and an adult, or are there specific modules/systems in our brain?
  - Social development/autism - roughly 1-2 in 1000, 10 in 1000 for autism spectrum disorder - is this a damaged module?
    - Lack of social connectedness, language impairment, and treating people as objects.
    - There are autistic individuals who fail at certain tasks, even if they are highly functioning.
- If there are modules, what are they?
- Could profound general differences between the minds of children and adults be an effect of learning language?
- Why study development? Even if you only care about adults, some questions about adulthood are answered by studying children.

## Research and methods in Developmental Psychology

- Involuntary/obligatory responses:
  - Young infants have little motor control - cannot hold their heads up, grab a toy, etc.
  - Ex: Habituation - if they are bored, they look away from a picture.
  - Violation of expectation paradigm - the drawbridge.
  - Solidity principle - "2 objects cannot occupy the same space at a time".
- Voluntary responses:
  - You have this under control.
  - 6-month infants remember 1 of 3 steps for 24 hours. Nine-month-olds remembers individual steps for 2-step sequence for 1 month.
- Psychophysiology:
  - Event-related potentials - fitting a participant with a stretchy cap. Children with autism process faces differently than typically developing children.
- Parent-report questionnaires
  - Child behavior checklist - ex: higher levels of maternal stress during pregnancy were associated with increased attention deficit/hyperactivity problems in children over 2 years later.
- Interview answers (by the kids).
- Longitudinal research - examine behavior over time/studying the kids as they age.
  - Risks: attrition, being better by being tested a lot (practice effect).
  - Cohort affect - history (ex: Facebook getting popular at the time the test was taken) can have an effect on the scores.
- Cross-sectional designs:
  - Participants of ages tested at the same point in time - they are age-related, not development-related.
- Sequential: different ages and over time.
- Challenges
  - Kids can't say their willingness to participate.
  - Recruitment: Expensive cause have to find the person.
  - Attrition - higher in kids.

## What is language/Basic facts about language

- `The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker, The Power of Babel by John McWhorter`.
- "The girl thinks the house is big" - can be said by any language in the world.
- Darwin: "Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, while no child has an instinct tendency to bake, brew, or write."
- There can be a society without architecture, clothing, but nothing without language.
- Creolization - a jargon - if you don't have common language with people you work together, you'll create a language for your own.
  - Children of these workers transform the "language" to an actual language.
- Every normal human has language, and language relates to creativity.
- Language is not about rote memory, it's about combining strings of words that haven't put together, and making something that makes sense.
- Abstract/unconscious rules (not grammar rules in school).
  - Ex: "The pig is eager to eat" - the pig will eat vs "The pig is easy to eat" the pig will be eaten.
  - "Bill knew John liked him" vs "himself" - you know that John likes either Bill or John already.
- Phonology/phonemes
  - There are 26 letters, but we have around 40 of them in English.
  - As a baby, it's hard to know which words exist/when they start/where they end.
- Morphology
  - There is no relation between the word "dog" and what it represents (a dog). Most words are like this.
  - Morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit. "Dog" vs "dogs" and "complain" vs "complained" - you don't need to know dogs and complained, they are combined with 2 morphemes.
  - English has roughly 80,000 morphemes.
- Syntax
  - "The infinite use of finite media."
  - We have symbols, and we have rules, and these rules have rules.
  - Consider "Fred, Barney, Wilma, Thinks, Likes" with rule "sentence = noun + verb + noun".
  - You have rules that can result in a new sentence: "Professor Bloom devoted way too much of his lecture talking about how I was amazed at the disturbed Mary when I told her that my roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese."
- The ambiguity of language: "Let him have it".
  - In a robbery, do you mean "let him be murdered" or "give the gun"?

## Language Acquisition

- Chomsky: See the development of language not as learning, but as growth.
- Language can be an innate thing, but there is a learning element to it.
  - Different languages can differentiate between "L" and "R" (phonemes). Same as morphemes (dog vs `chien`).
  - Syntax need to be learned for each language.
- Impairments in language - things can happen as an adult and as a child that can make you worse at understanding. There are smart people who cannot communicate.
- There are societies obsessed with getting a kid to learn to speak (flashcards) and some who don't care that much, but all kids learn to talk regardless.
- Feedback given by parent to kids re: talking - they don't matter.
  - We don't typically correct our kids' grammar.
- Development timetable:
  - When a child is born, they like listening to their own language.
  - They are sensitive to all phonemes - a baby can make distinctions that an adult can.
  - 7 months - babbling - deaf children babble with their hands.
  - 12 months - know word order.
  - 18 months - two word sentences and don't say many words. Function morphemes like "of, a, the" start to show up.
  - Past puberty - learning is harder, same with deaf people who want to learn sign.
- Learning English at 30 will make you not be as fluent who did so at an earlier age.

## Language and thought

- Reading is not universal - not all societies have.
- Do animals have language? They have different communication, but they aren't language.
  - Finite list of calls (monkeys)
  - No: phonology, morphology, syntax, names, recursion.
- Primates trained by humans?
  - Few "words".
  - Very slow learning
  - Limited ordering
  - No recursion.
  - `"Nim eat Nim eat", "Me eat me eat", "Tickle me Nim play"`
- Language processing: Your knowledge of language changes your perception of it. The things you think are gaps, you made them up.
  - Does the language you learn change the way you think? Ex: English propositions (in, on, under) vs Korean (whether something is firmly attached).
  - Is language necessary for abstract thought? 15-month olds can solve false belief tasks.
- Without language, we can't express thoughts/we can't think them.
  - Linguistic creatures know numbers, but they don't know 8 + 8 = 16. Without a symbolic system, they can't do complex math.

## Language and Language Use
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/language-and-language-use)

- Even when children who don’t have much language to begin with are brought together, they can begin to develop and use their own language.
- There is at least one known instance where children who had had little language were brought together and developed their own language spontaneously with minimum input from adults.
  - In Nicaragua in the 1980s, deaf children who were separately raised in various locations were brought together to schools for the first time.
  - Teachers tried to teach them Spanish with little success.
  - However, they began to notice that the children were using their hands and gestures, apparently to communicate with each other. Linguists were brought in to find out what was happening—it turned out the children had developed their own sign language by themselves.
- Common ground is a set of knowledge that the speaker and listener share and they think, assume, or otherwise take for granted that they share.
  - This way, common ground changes as we talk, gathering new information that we agree on and have evidence that we share. It evolves as people take turns to assume the roles of speaker and listener, and actively engage in the exchange of meaning.
- Audience design. Speakers design their utterances for their audiences by taking into account the audiences’ knowledge.
  - If their audiences are seen to be knowledgeable about an object, they tend to use a brief label of the object; for a less knowledgeable audience, they use more descriptive words to help the audience understand their utterances.
- To be sure that we coordinate, we have a conversation in small groups. The number of people engaging in a conversation at a time is rarely more than four.
  - By some counts, more than 90 percent of conversations happen in a group of four individuals or less.
  - Certainly, coordinating conversation among four is not as difficult as coordinating conversation among 10.
- When one person uses a certain expression to refer to an object in a conversation, others tend to use the same expression.
  - Furthermore, if someone says “the cowboy offered a banana to the robber,” rather than “the cowboy offered the robber a banana,” others are more likely to use the same syntactic structure (e.g., “the girl gave a book to the boy” rather than “the girl gave the boy a book”) even if different words are involved.
- Priming: Thinking about "rings" remind you about "marriage".
- 60-70% of everyday conversation turns out to be gossip.
  - Gossip—activities to think and communicate about our social world—is one of the most critical uses to which language has been put. Dunbar (1996) conjectured that gossiping is the human equivalent of grooming, monkeys and primates attending and tending to each other by cleaning each other’s fur.
  - Furthermore, by gossiping, humans can communicate and share their representations about their social world—who their friends and enemies are, what the right thing to do is under what circumstances, and so on. In so doing, they can regulate their social world—making more friends and enlarging one’s own group (often called the ingroup, the group to which one belongs) against other groups (outgroups) that are more likely to be one’s enemies.
- **Intriguingly, people tend to describe positive actions of their ingroup members using adjectives (e.g., he is generous) rather than verbs (e.g., he gave a blind man some change), and negative actions of outgroup members using adjectives (e.g., he is cruel) rather than verbs (e.g., he kicked a dog).**
- People tend to tell stories that evoke strong emotions.
- When stories travel through communication chains, they tend to become conventionalized.
- In other words, information transmitted multiple times was transformed to something that was easily understood by many, that is, information was assimilated into the common ground shared by most people in the linguistic community.
  - After the retelling of this story, much of the counter-stereotypical information was dropped, and stereotypical information was more likely to be retained. Because stereotypes are part of the common ground shared by the community, this finding too suggests that conversational retellings are likely to reproduce conventional content.

### Psychological Consequences of Language Use

- Thus, constructing a linguistic representation of another person’s emotion apparently biased the speaker’s memory of that person’s emotion.
  - Linguistically labeling one’s own emotional experience appears to alter the speaker’s neural processes.
  - When people linguistically labeled negative images, the amygdala—a brain structure that is critically involved in the processing of negative emotions such as fear—was activated less than when they were not given a chance to label them.
- Linguistic reconstructions of negative life events can have some therapeutic effects on those who suffer from the traumatic experiences.
- Language does not completely determine our thoughts—our thoughts are far too flexible for that—but habitual uses of language can influence our habit of thought and action.
  - For instance, some linguistic practice seems to be associated even with cultural values and social institution.
  - Pronouns such as “I” and “you” are used to represent the speaker and listener of a speech in English.
  - In an English sentence, these pronouns cannot be dropped if they are used as the subject of a sentence.
  - So, for instance, “I went to the movie last night” is fine, but “Went to the movie last night” is not in standard English.
  - However, in other languages such as Japanese, pronouns can be, and in fact often are, dropped from sentences.**
  - **It turned out that people living in those countries where pronoun drop languages are spoken tend to have more collectivistic values than those who use non–pronoun drop languages such as English. It was argued that the explicit reference to “you” and “I” may remind speakers the distinction between the self and other, and the differentiation between individuals.**

# Week 3

## From the world to the mind

- Successful perception involves educated, unconscious guesses of the world.
- Attention
- Memory - the key is organisation and understanding. And you can't trust your memory.

## Problems of Perception

- You see the world through your eyes, and you think that you are looking at the world with some annotations.
- You have an eye, light hits the retina, and they fire, and there will be an array of numbers.
- How do you know that the moon is far and not near? Or how do you know that a polygon is that, and not a square tilted to the back?
- We might have unconscious assumptions about the world works.

## Perception of brightness

- Coal vs snow is not just because "it's black".
- "Being in a shadow" makes things darker (according to the brain).

## Perception of objects

- Gestalt things

## Perception of depth

- `Müller-Lyer illusion` - the one with the two lines with arrows.
- `Ponzo illusion` - converging lines.
  - You think top line is longer, but you can't say why .

## Attention

- Sensory memory - what you see.
- Working memory - Associated with consciousness, what you see for a period of time.
- Long-term memory.
- Attention - sometimes effortless.
- Involuntary - if there is nothing else to listen to, someone talking will get your attention.
- Stroop effects - the one where the color is different from the text.

### Vision
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/vision)

- Photoactivation - the light energy becomes neural energy.
- Pupil then cornea/lens then project this to retina. Then, light is transduced into  neural energy by about 200 million photoreceptor cells.
  - Rods - more than cones - give us sensitivity to dim lighting and allow us to see at night.
  - Cones - allow us to see fine details in bright light and sensation of color. Around the central region of the retina.
- The nervous system analyses differences in light, and these differences get transmitted to the brain. The brain actually thinks that high light contrasts are the edges of things.
  - Evolutionarily, **Encoding the absolute amount of light in the world tells us little about what is out there.**
  - Contrast is so important that your neurons exaggerate those differences for you, lest you miss them.
- Your visual system must operate with billions of photons entering your eyeballs per second (day time) to hundreds (night time).
  - Rods - bleached during day time.
  - Cones - require more photons to fire, and they replenish faster than rods.
- Under bright light, your rods are bleached. When you move into dark environment, it will take about 30 minutes before they chemically recover (dark adaptation). This is why exiting a tunnel on a highway causes you to be blinded by the sudden light for about 1 second.
- Even though the sun is different from a night light, you don't experience the sun as "million of times brighter".

### Reconstruction

- Neurons project first into thalamus, then split to two and project towards two different parts of the brain.
- Reflexive eye movements - are in subcortical (evolutionarily older part) of the brain. These allow you to orient your eyes towards areas of interest/track objects as they move.
- Complex computations - allow you to visually experience the world - happen in the cortex, the newer part of the brain.
- Primary visual cortex (V1) - compute information about color, simple lines.
  -  Specialised brain areas - global-motion info, location/scenes, faces, letter/word processing.
- Prey have eyes on the side of the skull to see more.
- Predator have eyes in the same direction to reconstruct 3D.
- Why humans have 3 types of color photoreceptors, and mantis shrimp have 16?
  - Signal info about food, reproduction, health. We know slight changes in skin tone, and when can detect if someone is embarrassed, aroused, or ill.
- Red, blue, green cones, and you can't create "reddish-green" (opponent process theory of color).
- Color-blindness - missing one of the cones in the retina.
  - Not all cultures categorise colors in the same way.
  - The Berinmo tribe in New Guinea, for instance, appear to experience green shades that denote leaves that are alive as belonging to an entirely different color category than the sort of green shades that denote dying leaves.
  - Russians, too, appear to experience light and dark shades of blue as different categories of colors, in a way that most Westerners do not.
- For example, when you move your head in one direction, your eyes reflexively move in the opposite direction to compensate, allowing you to maintain your gaze on the object that you are looking at.
  - This reflex is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex.
  - It is achieved by integrating information from both the visual and the vestibular system (which knows about body motion and position).
  - You can experience this compensation quite simply.
  - First, while you keep your head still and your gaze looking straight ahead, wave your finger in front of you from side to side.
  - Notice how the image of the finger appears blurry.
  - Now, keep your finger steady and look at it while you move your head from side to side. Notice how your eyes reflexively move to compensate the movement of your head and how the image of the finger stays sharp and stable.
  - Vision also interacts with your proprioceptive system, to help you find where all your body parts are, and with your auditory system, to help you understand the sounds people make when they speak.

## Attention
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/attention)

- Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others.
- Attention in the context of this type of search task refers to the level of sustained attention or vigilance one can maintain. In contrast, divided attention tasks allow us to determine how well individuals can attend to many sources of information at once. Spatial attention refers specifically to how we focus on one part of our environment and how we move attention to other locations in the environment. These are all examples of different aspects of attention, but an implied element of most of these ideas is the concept of selective attention; some information is attended to while other information is intentionally blocked out.
- Shadowing/2 conversations - can only determine if a pitch changed.
- Unless a task is fully automated, some researchers suggest that “multi-tasking” doesn't really exist; you are just rapidly switching your attention back and forth between tasks.
- The effect of a cell phone conversation on performance (such as not noticing someone’s brake lights or responding more slowly to them) is just as significant when the individual is having a conversation with a hands-free device as with a handheld phone; the same impairments do not occur when listening to the radio or a book on tape
- Moreover, studies using eye-tracking devices have shown that drivers are less likely to later recognize objects that they did look at when using a cell phone while driving.
- These findings demonstrate that cognitive distractions such as cell phone conversations can produce inattentional blindness, or a lack of awareness of what is right before your eyes.

## Memory

- Losing memory = Jason Bourne? Not like a guy who doesn't understand how to do things again.
  - Explicit - consciously you know this - your name, etc.
  - Implicit - you might forget that you've been to a place but you sort of know your way around.
  - Semantic - facts
  - Episodic - episodes of your life
- Encoding (getting into head), storage, retrieval.
- Recall - freely recounting what you experienced.
- Recognition - from a set of options, which was it?

## Memory

- Sensory input -> Sensory memory.
  - "Well you're not listening to me" - you can say what they said because your sensory memory got it.
- Short term memory -> You can hold it in your head, but you can lose it. 7 +- 2.
- An expert in a field may know something more than you for the field they are good at.

## Learning

- Rehearsal and repeating things is not enough.
- Depth of processing - the deeper you think about something, the easier it is to remember.
- Mnemonics.

## Remembering

- Retrieval cues.
- Compatibility principle - because of cues, you remember things when you remember them in the same context in which you learnt them.
- If you learnt scuba words in a boat, you'll remember them better on a boat.

## Failures of memory

- Memories are physical things, which decay.
- New things come in, interfering with old memories.
- Change in retrieval cue (change house).
- Learning of a language transform how your memory works.
- Retrograde amnesia - losing your memory for some period of time prior to an accident.
- Anterograde amnesia - can't create new memories.
  - Clive Wearing - it feels like you just woke up for the first time.
- People with Anterograde amnesia can learn new things, but they might not know how they learned those new things.

## False Memories

- Leading questions can make you think of a new memory.
- Hypnotic regression - if a person can't remember, they make things up.
- You can create false memories when you try to reconstruct things.
- Flashbulb memories - you can remember where you are on Sept 11, 2001 - these are usually not accurate.

## Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval)
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/memory-encoding-storage-retrieval)

- Another type of memory is episodic memory—the ability to remember the episodes of our lives.
- Semantic memory is our storehouse of more-or-less permanent knowledge, such as the meanings of words in a language (e.g., the meaning of “parasol”) and the huge collection of facts about the world (e.g., there are 196 countries in the world, and 206 bones in your body).
- Collective memory refers to the kind of memory that people in a group share (whether family, community, schoolmates, or citizens of a state or a country). For example, residents of small towns often strongly identify with those towns, remembering the local customs and historical events in a unique way.
- Psychologists have long pinpointed distinctiveness—having an event stand out as quite different from a background of similar events—as a key to remembering events.
- In addition, when vivid memories are tinged with strong emotional content, they often seem to leave a permanent mark on us. Public tragedies, such as terrorist attacks, often create vivid memories in those who witnessed them. But even those of us not directly involved in such events may have vivid memories of them, including memories of first hearing about them.
- Because humans are creative, we are always going beyond the information we are given: we automatically make associations and infer from them what is happening. But, as with the word association mix-up above, sometimes we make false memories from our inferences—remembering the inferences themselves as if they were actual experiences.
- We can't know the entirety of what is in our memory, but only that portion we can actually retrieve. Something that cannot be retrieved now and which is seemingly gone from memory may, with different cues applied, reemerge.

## Forgetting and Amnesia
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/forgetting-and-amnesia)

- Usually, encoding failures occur because we are distracted or are not paying attention to specific details.
- Similarly, it has been well documented that distraction during learning impairs later memory.
- It has been known since the pioneering work of Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913) that as time passes, memories get harder to recall. Ebbinghaus created more than 2,000 nonsense syllables, such as dax, bap, and rif, and studied his own memory for them, learning as many as 420 lists of 16 nonsense syllables for one experiment. He found that his memories diminished as time passed, with the most forgetting happening early on after learning.
- More recently, some memory theorists have proposed that recent memory traces may be degraded or disrupted by new experiences (Wixted, 2004). Memory traces need to be consolidated, or transferred from the hippocampus to more durable representations in the cortex, in order for them to last.
- Retrieval hints can bring back to mind seemingly forgotten memories.
- Competition between memories can also lead to forgetting in a different way. Recalling a desired memory in the face of competition may result in the inhibition of related, competing memories. You may have difficulty recalling the name of Kennebunkport, Maine, because other Maine towns, such as Bar Harbor, Winterport, and Camden, come to mind instead.
- Finally, some memories may be forgotten because we deliberately attempt to keep them out of mind. Over time, by actively trying not to remember an event, we can sometimes successfully keep the undesirable memory from being retrieved either by inhibiting the undesirable memory or generating diversionary thoughts.
- **Is forgetting ever good? Most people would reason that forgetting that occurs in response to a deliberate attempt to keep an event out of mind is a good thing. No one wants to be constantly reminded of falling on their face in front of all of their friends. However, beyond that, it can be argued that forgetting is adaptive, allowing us to be efficient and hold onto only the most relevant memories.**

### Amnesia

- Functional amnesia involves a loss of memory that cannot be attributed to brain injury or any obvious brain disease and is typically classified as a mental disorder rather than a neurological disorder.

## Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/eyewitness-testimony-and-memory-biases)

- There is now a wealth of evidence, from research conducted over several decades, suggesting that eyewitness testimony is probably the most persuasive form of evidence presented in court, but in many cases, its accuracy is dubious. There is also evidence that mistaken eyewitness evidence can lead to wrongful conviction—sending people to prison for years or decades, even to death row, for crimes they did not commit.
- This phenomenon is called the misinformation effect, because the misinformation that subjects were exposed to after the event (here in the form of a misleading question) apparently contaminates subjects’ memories of what they witnessed. Hundreds of subsequent studies have demonstrated that memory can be contaminated by erroneous information that people are exposed to after they witness an event.
- Other studies have shown that misinformation can corrupt memory even more easily when it is encountered in social situations (Gabbert, Memon, Allan, & Wright, 2004). This is a problem particularly in cases where more than one person witnesses a crime. In these cases, witnesses tend to talk to one another in the immediate aftermath of the crime, including as they wait for police to arrive.
- It is hard for the legal system to do much about most of these problems. But there are some things that the justice system can do to help lineup identifications “go right.” For example, investigators can put together high-quality, fair lineups. A fair lineup is one in which the suspect and each of the foils is equally likely to be chosen by someone who has read an eyewitness description of the perpetrator but who did not actually witness the crime.

# Week 3

## Evolution of Emotion

- Brain is the origin of mental life.
- Where does the brain come from?
- Paley: "The watch looks constructed, and our body is constructed" - **argument from design**. This makes sense because things people build (ex: camera) look like what nature builds.
- Problem with creationism
  - Pushes back the question i.e. "so why study this?"
  - There is evidence for evolution and that it had occurred.
  - There is occasional poor design (eye has a blind spot, the urethra takes a longer path than is necessary).
- People knew about evolution long before Darwin, but his discovery is how the complex parts of the body came from.
- Camouflage: Darwinian argument is that some animals just randomly better at blending in with the environment.
- The eye was not created at once, and there are different "eyes" from a no eye to a fully developed eye.

## Why Evolution Matters

- Ultimate causation - the reason why something has evolved.
- Proximate causation - what the user wants.
  - People eat not because of "utility" but because it feels good?
  - Evolutionarily, "I love my kids" because those who do spread their progeny.
  - Psychologically, you can love your kids even if they don't bear children.
- Misconception: Everything we evolve/adapt exists for a purpose.
  - Hiccups, lower back pain, self-pity have no "evolutionary purpose".
  - Good to figure out which of our traits are adaptations, and which are accidents.
  - Ex: Why do we love television or chocolate?
  - Why do we love art, humor? Is this adaptation or it's just an accident?
  - William James - "Why do we smile when pleased and not scowl?"
- Things that look "natural to us" but are actual adaptations.
  - Why does poop smell bad?
  - Why does chocolate taste good?
  - Why do we love our children?
  - Why do we get angry when people hit us?
- Misconception about emotions: You don't need emotions to do things (ex: science fiction robots). Emotions are fundamental to human life - we don't see them any more as noise in the machine, rather as products of evolution, and they're there for a reason.
- **Emotions set goals and priorities. Plainly, our emotions are shaped by cultural contexts. Depending on who you are and where you live, your emotions will be different, they'll respond to different things. But just as we'd expect from an evolutionary perspective, they have universal roots.**

## Facial expressions

- Darwin: fascinated with facial expressions.
- Face - age, identity, sexual signals, feelings, emotions.
- Pre-literate culture - the common story for a fear face was a wild pig and you not having a weapon.
- Facial expressions
  - Serve as social signals.
  - We are more prone to smile when happy, and we want others to know it.
  - Athletes can be stoic, but when getting the medal, they are smiling to the audience.
  - You can be happy but not smile if you are by yourself.
- Happiness smile (Duchenne smile) with the eyes - real smile. Fake smile - turning your mouth outwards, but that is it. Happy couples have more sincere smiles.
  - Coy smile - appeasement smile/"related to a desire to affiliate". Ex: baby smiling sheepishly.
- Fear - can be a social emotion because you can be afraid of other people. Ex: spiders, snakes, heights, storms, large animals, darkness, blood, strangers, humiliation, deep water, and leaving home alone.
  - But why do we not have a fear of cars, or electric outlets, if they are dangerous?
  - Even people who have never seen a spider or snake fear them. This is more evolution-like rather than conditioning type.

## Kinship

- Why is kindness "evolutionarily good for us"?
- Intuition is that free riders would take advantage, yet altruism thrives.
- Dawkins: We are evolved altruists, but we are not indiscriminate altruists.
- Animals who care for itself and its offspring would be more evolutionarily successful. "An animal is merely the gene's way of making another gene."
  - Kin selection - If a gene increases the chance that the bearer of that gene will survive, then the better the chance that gene survives.
  - Pure selfishness is untenable.
- Animals have evolved to be nice to kin.
- Humans have a long period of dependence prior to sexual maturity.
  - What are the Psychological mechanisms of childcare of how parents respond to children?
    - Wired to listen to distress calls, finding babies cute.
    - Baby-faced adults are perceived to be naive, helpless, kind.
    - Cupboard theory (Skinner) - baby favors mom because of milk.
    - Innate attachment (Bowlby) - positive force to mom for comfort, negative force with fear of strangers.
  - What are the psychological mechanisms underlying how children respond to parents?

## Prisoners Dilemma/Nice to non-kin

- Reciprocal altruism - "scratch my back and I scratch yours".
- Shunning is a powerful punishment.
  - You need: recognising cheaters, remembering who they are, and holding memory across time.
- Prisoner's dilemma.
- One-shot prisoner's dilemma - doing it and never meeting the person ever again.
- Evolutionarily: So, we feel gratitude and liking for people who cooperate with us, which motivates us to be nice to them in the future, we feel anger and distrust to those who betray us, which motivates us to betray or avoid them in the future, and we feel guilt when we betray someone who cooperates with us. This motivates us to behave better in the future.

## Irrationality and Culture

- Even for a one-shot ultimatum game, people normally reject them out of spite.
- The usefulness of irrationality
  - A rational person is easily exploited.
  - A person with a temper has an advantage: "Mess with me and I'll kill you".
  - If they are super irrational, then you won't deal with this person.
  - **In chronically feuding and warring societies, an essential manly virtue is the capacity for violence. To turn the other cheek is not saintly but stupid. Or contemptibly weak.**
- The importance of reputation depends on the culture.
- Cultures of honor:
  - Can't rely on the law, resources are easily taken, and reputation for excessive violent retaliation is essential to keep your resources.
  - Ex: Warriors, cowboys.
  - They accept gun laws, corporal punishment, forgiving towards crimes of honor (re: killing someone who insult you), higher rate of violence only in certain circumstances/where honor is being questioned.
- Being raised in one culture makes you more aggressive when insulted than in another culture.

## Affective Neuroscience
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/affective-neuroscience)

- In humans, emotions and their associated neural systems have additional layers of complexity and flexibility.
  - Compared to animals, humans experience a vast variety of nuanced and sometimes conflicting emotions.
  - Humans also respond to these emotions in complex ways, such that conscious goals, values, and other cognitions influence behavior in addition to emotional responses.
- Across species, emotional responses are organized around the organism’s survival and reproductive needs.
  - Emotions influence perception, cognition, and behavior to help organisms survive and thrive.
- Specific emotions are not located in a single structure of the brain. Instead, emotional responses involve networks of activation, with many parts of the brain activated during any emotional process.

### Desire - Neural Systems of Reward Seeking

- When the appetitive system is aroused, the organism shows enthusiasm, interest, and curiosity.
- These neural circuits motivate the animal to move through its environment in search of rewards such as appetizing foods, attractive sex partners, and other pleasurable stimuli.
- When the appetitive system is underaroused, the organism appears depressed and helpless.
- Research in both humans and nonhuman animals shows that the left frontal cortex (compared to the right frontal cortex) is more active during appetitive emotions such as desire and interest.
  - Suffered damage to the left frontal cortex: developed depression, whereas those with damage to the right frontal cortex developed mania.

### Liking: The neural circuits of pleasure and enjoyment

- “Liking” (e.g., enjoyment of a sweet liquid) can be measured in babies and nonhuman animals by measuring licking speed, tongue protrusions, and happy facial expressions, whereas “wanting” (desire) is shown by the willingness to work hard to obtain a reward.
- Brain regions for liking are sensitive to opioids and endocannabinoids.
  - Stimulation of other regions of the reward system increases wanting, but does not increase liking, and in some cases even decreases liking.
  - Distinction between desire and enjoyment: for addiction, particularly why individuals often continue to frantically pursue rewards such as cocaine, opiates, gambling, or sex, even when they no longer experience pleasure from obtaining these rewards due to habituation.

### Fear: The neural system of freezing and fleeing

- The role of the amygdala in fear responses has been extensively studied.
- The visual cortex sends the information on to the amygdala, provoking a fear response.
- **However, the thalamus also quickly sends the information straight to the amygdala, so that the organism can react before consciously perceiving the snake.**

### Rage: The circuits of anger and attack

- Anger can be evoked through goal frustration, physical pain, or physical restraint.
- In territorial animals, anger is provoked by a stranger entering the organism’s home territory
- The neural networks for anger and fear are near one another, but separate.
- The anger circuits are linked to the appetitive circuits, such that lack of an anticipated reward can provoke rage.
- In addition, when humans are angered, they show increased left frontal cortical activation, supporting the idea that anger is an approach-related emotion.

### Love: The neural systems of care and attachment

- The emotions that motivate nurturing behavior (e.g., maternal care) are distinguishable from those that motivate staying close to an attachment figure in order to receive care and protection (e.g., infant attachment).

### Grief: The neural networks of loneliness and panic

- When infant humans or other infant mammals are separated from their mothers, they produce distress vocalizations, or crying. The attachment circuits are those that cause organisms to produce distress vocalizations when electrically stimulated.
- Opiate drugs and nicotine artificially produce feelings of pleasure and gratification, similar to those normally produced during positive social interactions.
- Panic attacks appear to be an intense form of separation distress triggered by the attachment system, and panic can be effectively relieved by opiates.

### Evolutionary Theories in Psychology
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/evolutionary-theories-in-psychology)

- In the case of dating, doing something like offering a gift might represent more than a nice gesture.
  - Just as chimpanzees will give food to mates to show they can provide for them, when you offer gifts to your dates, you are communicating that you have the money or “resources” to help take care of them.
  - The receiver of the gift evaluates not only the gift but also the gift-giver's clothes, physical appearance, and many other qualities, to determine whether the individual is a suitable mate.

### Sexual Selection Theory

- Intrasexual competition - among members of the same sex.
  - Ex: Plumage of peacocks make it easy to hunt them, but better for sexual selection.
  - Even though large antlers make it harder for stags to run through the forest, they provide a higher chance of attracting a mate.
  - Humans: Sports.
- Intersexual selection - if members of one sex are attracted to certain qualities in mates—such as brilliant plumage, signs of good health, or even intelligence—those desired qualities get passed on in greater numbers, simply because their possessors mate more often.

### Sexual Strategies Theory

- For women, even the minimum investment is significant: after becoming pregnant, they have to carry that child for nine months inside of them.
-For men, the need to focus on making wise mating decisions isn't as important. That is, unlike women, men 1) don’t biologically have the child growing inside of them for nine months, and 2) do not have as high a cultural expectation to raise the child.
- Men express a desire for a larger number of sex partners than women do.
  - They let less time elapse before seeking sex.
  - They are more willing to consent to sex with strangers and are less likely to require emotional involvement with their sex partners.
  - They have more frequent sexual fantasies and fantasize about a larger variety of sex partners.
  - They are more likely to regret missed sexual opportunities.
  - And they lower their standards in short-term mating, showing a willingness to mate with a larger variety of women as long as the costs and risks are low.
- The qualities women and men generally look for when choosing long-term mates are very similar: both want mates who are intelligent, kind, understanding, healthy, dependable, honest, loyal, loving, and adaptable.
- **Modern women have inherited the evolutionary trait to desire mates who possess resources, have qualities linked with acquiring resources (e.g., ambition, wealth, industriousness), and are willing to share those resources with them. On the other hand, men more strongly desire youth and health in women, as both are cues to fertility. These male and female differences are universal in humans.**

### Error Management Theory

- "Better to be safe than story."
- If during our evolutionary history we encountered decisions like these generation after generation, over time an adaptive bias would be created: we would make sure to err in favor of the least costly (in this case, least dangerous) option (e.g., walking around the leaves).
- Visual descent illusion: jumping of a ledge seems easy in theory, but it gets so high when you're actually there.
- Auditory looming bias: an ambulance seems closer when it's coming toward you, but suddenly seems far away once it's immediately passed.
- It's been shown in the laboratory with participants engaging in actual “speed dating,” where the men interpret sexual interest from the women more often than the women actually intended it.
  - In short, EMT predicts that men, more than women, will over-infer sexual interest based on minimal cues, and empirical research confirms this adaptive mating bias.

## Social animals

- Social priming: Holding warm coffee makes other people think you are warm, and cold if holding cold coffee.
  - "Favorite letter" related to your name letter.
  - Those who move to Georgia have G in their name.

## Self

- The Spotlight Effect: We think people are looking at us.
- Dominant emotion for young people = embarrassment.
- Regret when people die - things that they didn't do. And it's more because they were thinking about what people were going to think of them.
- How do you compare to everyone else? Most people would think they are doing much better than expected. (Lake Wobegon Effect)
  - Why? Feedback given to us is often more positive.
  - Being a "great" driver differs depending on who they ask.
- Self-serving bias: We attribute to ourselves positive traits rather than negative traits.
  - Positives are because of us.
  - Negatives are a result of external factors.
- Cognitive dissonance theory: What we do makes sense.
  - Internal inconsistency is unpleasant, and we want to reduce that feeling.
  - Insufficient justification - people paid lower for a boring task say they are fun, just because it sucks if they think that they did a boring task for so few money.
  - Hazing: A humiliating experience makes you more invested in the group - this makes things "worth it". Therapists want you to pay, because you'll value the therapy more.
  - If you paid for something, you'd think you have to love it.
- Problem with paying kids to read: they'd "read to get paid" rather than actually reading.

## Attribution

- A claim about the cause of someone's behavior.
- Seeking a reason for the occurence for events/behaviors.
- Fundamental attribution error.
  - Even people asking near-to-impossible questions are seen as smarter than people failing to answer the same question.
  - Professors are thought to be smart, because they talk about things.
  - Person bias: Seeing actors as the characters they play. When they play a doctor in television, the natural tendency is to attribute the actor with accomplishments.

## Liking

- Familiarity: The more you see something, the more you like it.
  - Proximity/being physically close to a person influences who you marry or you become friends with.
- Similarity.
- Attractiveness - even thought to be smarter or more moral.
- First impressions - really, really have a big influence on things. We form first impressions very quickly - even in 5 seconds.
- Pygmalion effect - the intentions of another person transform you. "The difference between a lady and a flower-girl is the way they are treated."

## Psychology of Groups

- All animals collect information about individuals, and they generalise info on new individuals based on the current information.
- "Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances."
- We break people into gender, age, race, etc.
- Categorising people - you wouldn't ask a baby for directions.
- Stereotypes are often positive and accurate.

## Social Categories

- Stereotypes are not always accurate.
  - Confirmation bias
  - If all you know about so-and-so social groups are from the media, then you will have a different impression.
- We take groups seriously, even if the groups are arbitrary (different color shirt teams).
- We tend to think people should be judged as individuals, not as group members.
- Criminal profiling re: males do more crime than females.
- Levels of stereotypes
  - Public - Ex: perception about blacks over the years.
  - Private - People use ethnic slurs/racist things when they are on the computer.
  - Implicit - Even below the level of consciousness, we have biases against certain races - even for fractions of second.
  - Group membership matters, even when we think it shouldn't. Even if we have implicit biases, we should figure out a way to not have those biases. We should use our heads to override our hearts.

## An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/an-introduction-to-the-science-of-social-psychology)

- In studies of conversations between both strangers and close friends—conversations occurring in research laboratories and in coffee shops—mobile phones appeared to distract people from connecting with one another. The participants in these studies reported lower conversation quality, lower trust, and lower levels of empathy for the other person.
- A classic study of life stress found that the most stressful events in a person’s life—the death of a spouse, divorce, and going to jail—are so painful because they entail the loss of relationships. We spend a huge amount of time thinking about and interacting with other people, and researchers are interested in understanding these thoughts and actions.
- Social psychology feels so close to home because it often deals with universal psychological processes to which people can easily relate.
  - For example, people have a powerful need to belong.
  - In a study of the most and least happy people, the differentiating factor was not gender, income, or religion; it was having high-quality relationships.
  - Even introverts report being happier when they are in social situations.
  - People who feel lonely or isolated are more vulnerable to depression and problems with physical health.

### Social Psychology is a Science

- High quality research often involves the ability to control the environment, as in the case of laboratory experiments.
  - The research laboratory, however, is artificial, and what happens there may not translate to the more natural circumstances of life.
  - This is why social psychologists have developed their own set of unique methods for studying attitudes and social behavior.

### Attraction

- Interestingly, when rating the faces of strangers, white people, Maasai, and African-Americans were in general agreement about which faces were better looking.
- Not only that, but there was high consistency in which specific facial features were associated with being good looking.
- Ex: smooth skin.
- The researchers found that Maasai tribal people agreed about the faces of strangers—but not about the faces of people they knew!
  - Two people might look at the same photo of someone they knew; one would give a thumbs up for attractiveness, the other one, not so much.
  - It appeared that friends were using some other standard of beauty than simply nose, eyes, skin, and other facial features.
- When the university students rated strangers, they focused on actual facial features, such as skin smoothness and large eyes, to make their judgments (whether or not they realized it).
  - But when it came to the hotness-factor of their friends, these features appeared not to be very important.
  - Suddenly, likable personality characteristics were a better predictor of who was considered good looking.
  - People tend to be attracted not just to muscles and symmetrical faces but also to kindness and generosity.
  - As more information about a person’s personality becomes available, it becomes the most important aspect of a person’s attractiveness.

### Attitudes

- Prejudice refers to how a person feels about an individual based on their group membership.
  - Someone with a prejudice against tattoos may feel uncomfortable sitting on the metro next to a young man with multiple, visible tattoos.
- Discrimination occurs when a person is biased against an individual, simply because of the individual’s membership in a social category.
  - When people are instructed to have empathy—to try to see the world through another person’s eyes—it gives them not only more empathy for that individual, but also for the group as a whole.

### Peace & Conflict

- Researchers were curious as to whether people from cultures of honor would overestimate the likelihood of violent reactions in others.
  - People from honor cultures did not differ from others in their personal likelihood of responding aggressively.
  - They said they would expect their peers—other people from their culture —to act violently even though they, themselves, would not.

### Social Influence

- None of us can escape social influence.
  - Social influence is the heart and soul of social psychology.
  - Conformity and obedience.
- Persuasion: Good for tips - server show chocolates, ask person to get one, then went back and gave another chocolate - increased tips/reciprocity.

### Social Cognition

- Social cognition is the term for the way we think about the social world and how we perceive others.
- When we make educated guesses about the efforts or motives of others, this is called social attribution.
  - We are “attributing” their behavior to a particular cause.
  - For example, we might attribute the failure of a date to arrive on time to car trouble, forgetfulness, or the wrong-headed possibility that we are not worthy of being loved.

## The Psychology of Groups

- People respond negatively when their need to belong is unfulfilled.
  - College students feel homesick but not when they have a socially satisfying group.
  - Ostracism/deliberate exclusion from groups is highly stressful and can lead to depression, confused thinking, and even aggression.
- Although any kind of companionship is appreciated, we prefer those who provide us with reassurance and support as well as accurate information.
  - In some cases, we also prefer to join with others who are even worse off than we are.
  - **To maintain a sense of self-worth, people seek out and compare themselves to the less fortunate. This process is known as downward social comparison.**
- Groups/collective self-esteem.
  - If we are in the better group, we can take pride in our superiority.
- Groups tend to form whenever “people become dependent on one another for the satisfaction of their needs”.
  - The advantages of group life may be so great that humans are biologically prepared to seek membership and avoid isolation.
- Competition: Cyclists were faster when they competed against other racers than when they raced alone against the clock.
- Facilitating effects of an audience usually only occur when the task requires the person to perform dominant responses, i.e., ones that are well-learned or based on instinctive behaviors.
- If the task requires nondominant responses, i.e., novel, complicated, or untried behaviors that the organism has never performed before or has performed only infrequently, then the presence of others inhibits performance.

### Social Loafing and Teamwork

- First, when people work together they must coordinate their individual activities and contributions to reach the maximum level of efficiency—but they rarely do. Three people in a tug-of-war competition, for example, invariably pull and pause at slightly different times, so their efforts are uncoordinated.
- When sales personnel work in groups with shared goals, they tend to “take it easy” if another salesperson is nearby who can do their work.
- Group cohesion is the integrity, solidarity, social integration, or unity of a group.
  - In most cases, members of cohesive groups like each other and the group and they also are united in their pursuit of collective, group-level goals.
  - Members tend to enjoy their groups more when they are cohesive, and cohesive groups usually outperform ones that lack cohesion.

## Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping

- Historical biases were widespread and institutionalized. It was considered acceptable to openly disparage entire groups of people and to pass laws that restricted or harmed these groups.
- Blatant biases (also called “explicit biases”) are conscious beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing to admit, which express hostility toward other groups while unduly favoring one’s own group.

### Social Dominance Orientation

- Social dominance orientation (SDO) describes a belief that group hierarchies are inevitable in all societies and are even a good idea to maintain order and stability.
- People with a social dominance orientation are more likely to be attracted to certain types of careers, such as law enforcement, that maintain group hierarchies.
- **SDO is not just about being personally dominant and controlling of others; SDO describes a preferred arrangement of groups with some on top (preferably one’s own group) and some on the bottom.**
- **Although research has shown that people higher in SDO are more likely to be politically conservative, there are other traits that more strongly predict one’s SDO. For example, researchers have found that those who score higher on SDO are usually lower than average on tolerance, empathy, altruism, and community orientation.**
  - In general, those high in SDO have a strong belief in work ethic—that hard work always pays off and leisure is a waste of time.
  - People higher on SDO tend to choose and thrive in occupations that maintain existing group hierarchies (police, prosecutors, business), compared to those lower in SDO, who tend to pick more equalizing occupations (social work, public defense, psychology).
- The point is that SDO—a preference for inequality as normal and natural—also predicts endorsing the superiority of certain groups: men, native-born residents, heterosexuals, and believers in the dominant religion.
  - This means seeing women, minorities, homosexuals, and non-believers as inferior.
  - Understandably, people from the first list of groups tends to score higher on SDO, while those from the second group tend to score lower.
  - For example, the SDO gender difference (men higher, women lower) appears all over the world.
  - **At its heart, SDO rests on a fundamental belief that the world is tough and competitive with only a limited number of resources.**

### Right-wing Authoritarianism

- Returning to an example from earlier, the homeowner high in SDO may dislike the outgroup member moving into her neighborhood because it “threatens” one’s economic resources (e.g. lowering the value of one’s house; fewer openings in the school; etc.).
- By contrast, those high in RWA may equally dislike the outgroup member moving into the neighborhood but for different reasons.
- Here, it is because this outgroup member brings in values or beliefs that the person high in RWA disagrees with, thus “threatening” the collective values of his or her group.
- RWA respects group unity over individual preferences, wanting to maintain group values in the face of differing opinions.
- Calls for national unity and patriotism that do not tolerate dissenting voices are an example.
