# Week 1

## History of Psychology
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology)

- Empiricism: Knowledge comes from experience.
- Even though human senses were fallible, the mind could be measured using the methods of science.
- Helmholtz: There is a psychological reality and a physical reality and that the two are not identical. (Sensory experience vs external reality).
- Wundt - 1875, experimental psychology in university. Self-reports to stimuli (introspection), elements of consciousness.
- Structuralism - where the mind is.
- America - William James - Functionalism - what the mind does.
- Cattell - mental abilities could be inherited and measured using mental tests. Identify those with superior intelligence.
- Gestalt psychology - the mind processes information simultaneously, rather than sequentially.
- Behaviorism - Through studying behaviours, the laws of learning could be derived, and that would promote and control behavior.
- Bartlett - constructive mind - people us their past experiences to construct frameworks to study new experiences.
- Binet - modern intelligence tests.
- Applied psychology - psychology for industry and engineering - designing kitchens, appliances.
- Psychology and society: Sex differences. Emotion did not influence women's decisions any more than men's. Menstruation did not negatively impact women's cognitive or motor abilities. Psychology of race and segregation.

## The Brain

- Phineas Gage - recovered from the accident. He was sort of okay, but his personality transformed (from efficient and capable to irreverent, profane).
- Astonishing Hypothesis - You  are just the behavior of a vast assembly of neurons, molecules. (Materialism)
- Dualism (vs Materialism) - Descartes believed that animals were material things, but humans are in part material and are in part psychological.
  - Argument 1: Humans are capable of capable and spontaneity of action. We are not machines that respond to the environment, our behavior is far complicated.
  - Argument 2: We don't feel like bodies. "I think, therefore I am". What do we know for sure? We can be wrong about the physical world (ex: The Matrix) or we might just be a brain in a vat. The only thing we can't doubt is that we are thinking.
- When you describe something, "my legs", "my arms" as if we own that body. We also think of body switching, body swaps. This is not a recent belief, this was in Kafka's Metamorphosis. Ex: being transformed into a pig, demonic possession. Minds without bodies like gods, angels.
  - This appeals to the survival or the self after the destruction of the body. You think of things like heaven/hell or reincarnation. The destruction of your body need not be the destruction of you. These all rest on the dualist perspective.

### Neurons

- The brain when you take it out of the head is just grey (red with blood). Roughly 100 billion in the human brain.
  - Sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons.
  - Neurons fire all or nothing. How does this work re: soft touch and hard touch? Neurons also code for intensity and frequency, not just "the presence of stimuli".
  - Psychopharmacology and drugs work by fiddling with the neurotransmitters - antagonistically or agonistically. Ex: curare (paralyzes motor neurons, can kill you if it paralyzes your heart), alcohol (inhibits parts of your brain), amphetamines (increases arousal), Prozac (increase dopamine and serotonin) to fight depression.
  - Clusters: the brain is resistant to damage, is extremely fast with parallel processing.

### Parts of the brain

- Subcortical structures/below the cortex.
  - Medulla: autonomic functions like heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, swallowing.
  - Cerebellum: balance, motor movements, mental/sensory tasks, automation of tasks.
  - Hypothalamus - hunger, thirst, sex, body temperature, regulation of functions.
- Cerebral cortex - fish don't have this, reptiles/amphibians have a small part of it.
  - Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe.
  - Things that are close in the brain are close in the body. How do we know which parts of the brain control what? We use MRI and check what damage to which parts of the brain affect people.
  - Apraxia: Unable to do an action - you can move your things but can't do the action.
  - Agnosia: Perception/can't recognize. Can describe the picture in parts but not what the picture is. Can't recognise faces.
  - Sensory neglect - you can block the left side of the world.
  - Aphasia - language.
  - Acquired psychopathy.
- This is an argument vs dualism.

## Our two brains/A bit of humility

- Left - written language, reasoning.
- Right brain - insight, imagination, art awareness.
- Right brain sees the left side of the world and vice-versa.
- Corpus callosum - what connects the left and the right side of the brain. It's actually quicker to see things on the right vs on the left, because there is a delay.
- Epilepsy - it's like an electrical storm in your brain. And when you cut the corpus callosum, it would be like you're two people (one can speak and one can't).
- If materialism is right, then there is no such thing as souls? If scientists are to speak honestly, it doesn't exist? To be humble about this, while the mind is a computer that can interpret quantitative and qualitative experiences, there is The Hard Problem of consciousness. The feeling of what things are cannot be simulated on a computer. Subjective experiences like "why do I feel this way given a sensory input". How do neurons give rise to feelings?
- So do we have morality, spirituality, free will?

## Readings - The Brain
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/the-brain)

- The brain uses 20% of the oxygen and calories we consume despite being just 2% of the total weight.
- If we have an abundance of brain fuel and neurons, how can we explain our limited cognitive abilities? Why can’t we do more at once? The most likely explanation is the way these neurons are wired up. We know, for instance, that many neurons in the visual cortex (the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information) are hooked up in such a way as to inhibit each other. When one neuron fires, it suppresses the firing of other nearby neurons.
- The two cerebral hemispheres can be further subdivided into four lobes: the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes.
  - Occipital lobe: vision.
  - Temporal lobe: auditory processing, memory, and multisensory integration (e.g., the convergence of vision and audition).
  - Parietal lobe: houses the somatosensory (body sensations) cortex and structures involved in visual attention, as well as multisensory convergence zones.
  - Frontal lobe: houses the motor cortex and structures involved in motor planning, language, judgment, and decision-making.
  - The frontal lobe is proportionally larger in humans than in any other animal.
- Split brain:
  - Because of the contralateral representation of sensory information, if an object is placed in only the left or only the right visual hemifield, then only the right or left hemisphere will see it.
  - Because language is very often localized in the left hemisphere, if we show the right hemisphere a picture and ask the patient what she saw, she will say she didn't see anything (because only the left hemisphere can speak and it didn't see anything).
  - However, we know that the right hemisphere sees the picture because if the patient is asked to press a button whenever she sees the image, the left hand (which is controlled by the right hemisphere) will respond despite the left hemisphere’s denial that anything was there.
- Grey vs white matter:
  - Gray matter is responsible for synthesizing proteins.
  - White matter - the axons of the neurons.
- Phrenology - the bumps in the skull affected the brain.

## Freud

- Freud affects everyday life. Freud was a cocaine and smoking addict.
- Penis envy: When a girl discovers that she doesn't have a penis, then she becomes closer to her father than her mother to compensate for the lack of a penis (Electra complex).
- His ideas - unconscious motivation (why do you feel and act in a way) and unconscious dynamics (conflict between the different systems in brain, like dreams, speech errors, jokes).
  - You might want to marry someone because of something else rather than "I love him". Freud says these motivations are unconscious.
  - Your unconscious is not a rational computer.
    - Id: animal part of ourself. Pleasure principle.
    - Ego: Understands reality and logic.
    - Superego: Internalisation of society's moral standards, and is responsible for guilt.
- Psychosexual stages:
  - Oral stage - the mouth is associated with sexual pleasure. This can mean they like eating or smoking.
  - Anal stage - anus is associated with pleasure, toilet training can lead to fixation. This can lead to someone being anal.
  - Phallic stage - pleasure in genitals. Excessive masculinity and the need for attention from females.
  - Latency - sexuality is repressed.
  - Genital - sexual feelings re-emerge.
- Repressed stuff - it spills out in dreams and in tongue. To repress these, you can have defense mechanisms.
  - Displacement - redirect shameful thoughts to more appropriate targets, like hating your dad becomes bullying another kid.
  - Sublimation - taking unacceptable desire to another activity - being mad and putting it to lifting weights.
  - Projection - attributing unacceptable impulse to someone else.
  - Rationalisation - reasoning away anxiety-producing thoughts - punishing kids "for their own good".
  - Regression - acting childish.
  - Reaction formation - replace threatening wishes with their opposites.
- Hysteria - "having amnesia to block things out". And when it's recovered, catharsis.
- So, which of his theories are really true?
  - Some of his theories aren't provable/falsifiable. Scientific theories can be proven wrong. If you can't falsify something, then it isn't science.
  - Very few of his claims have been correct. So why is he talked about? His grand idea of a dynamic unconscious is still intact.

## Thinking like a Psychological Scientist
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/thinking-like-a-psychological-scientist)

- Scientific theories:
  - Accurate - match real-world observations.
  - Consistent.
  - Scope - multiple data points.
  - Simplicity.
  - Fruitfulness - can make new testable relationships.
- Falsifiability - this distinguishes science from pseudoscience.
- Scientists aren't interested in what isn't, they want to know why things are the way they are.
- ***Because of these uncertainties, we do not say that a study—especially a single study—proves a hypothesis. Instead, we say the results of the study offer evidence in support of the hypothesis. Even if we tested this across 10 thousand or 100 thousand people we still could not use the word “proven” to describe this phenomenon. This is because inductive reasoning is based on probabilities. Probabilities are always a matter of degree; they may be extremely likely or unlikely.***
- Inductive - Given current observations vs historical patterns, this is what is going to happen.
- Deductive - given a general principle, if its truth applies to all circumstances, then is applies to this circumstance.

## B.F. Skinner

- Packaged ideas like the theory of behaviorism.
- Behaviorism
  - Emphasis on learning, no human nature. Any one is trainable to become any thing.
  - Anti-mentalism - Freud said crazy complex things, behaviorists said they want to do simple, observable science.
- Habituation - A decline in the tendency to familiar stimuli, due to repeated exposure. This is an adaptive mechanism to keep us focusing on new objects and events.
- Classical conditioning - Pavlov's dog - sometimes just the trigger (bell) without the food can make a dog salivate.
  - Before, start with neutral stimulus (bell) with no response.
  - During, add the neutral stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus (food).
  - At some point, just the neutral stimulus could cause the conditioned response.
  - Classical conditioning can create phobias.
  - Hunger reactions: Things like commercials or passing by restaurants can make you hungry.
  - Question: What's the optimal timing between conditioned and unconditioned stimulus? It's apparently if CS comes before the UCS, not at the same time.
- Instrumental/operant conditioning: The way you act in the world shapes your future actions.
  - Cats that practice can remember the actions that let it get its food. If an action brings a reward, that action gets stamped into the mind.
  - Positive vs negative reinforcement, and do it step by step.
  - Ex: training approximations of animal behavior to get the animal to learn things. Animals can work for poker chips.
  - Classical conditioning to associate patting with the head as a reward.
- Fixed ratio reinforcement (give reward after 100 times) and variable ratio reinforcement (like slot machine or social media).
- To make a behavior last, don't reinforce it all the time, reinforce it intermittently.
- Scientific assessment:
  - There are "innate" things, not everything is learned.
  - The way birds learn bird song is not the way humans learn singing.
  - Animals do get better at things, even without reinforcement and punishment. There is latent learning, which is learning without any sort of feedback.
  - Chomsky: There are things that you do without reinforcement. Skinner: Reinforcement is "you like it". Chomsky: So the purpose is so vague, that it doesn't make sense.

## Conditioning and Learning
[Reference](https://nobaproject.com/modules/conditioning-and-learning)

- Pavlov's dog explains why people get anxious looking at a crowded bus, why the sound of a morning alarm is so hated, and even why we swear off certain foods we've only tried once.
- In humans, they associate a drug they've taken with the environment that they've taken in.
- Pavlov dog - not just salivation, but the secretion of gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes, and insulin also happen. For humans, even the feel of the couch in front of the TV can be a cue.
- Flavors associated with certain nutrients can become preferred without arousing awareness of the pairing.
- Erasing conditioned stimuli - this can happen if the CS is presented repeatedly without the US.
- Sometimes, the original learning can still go back. Even after you haven't seen a chalkboard for so long, seeing one once again can make you think about the agony of detention once again.
- Operant conditioning - the response always requires choosing one behavior over others - you go to the bar instead of staying at home and studying.
- **In general, a given reinforcer will be less reinforcing if there are many alternative reinforcers in the environment. For this reason, alcohol, sex, or drugs may be less powerful reinforcers if the person’s environment is full of other sources of reinforcement, such as achievement at work or love from family members.**
- Observational learning - this is like a child watching the behavior of other kids instead of asking the rules of the game.
- Social learning theory - those of higher status or authority can help reinforce learning in others.
- Parts of observational learning:
  - Attention - pay attention to what is observing in order to learn.
  - Retention
  - Initiation - can do it.
  - Must possess motivation to engage in observational learning.
- If an adult beats up a doll, children were more likely to behave aggressively towards the doll.
- If the adult receives punishment for being aggressive towards the doll, then the children would be less aggressive against it.
