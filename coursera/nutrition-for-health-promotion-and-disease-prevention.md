1.5 – Focus on Protein
Roles
* Chemical reaction catalysts, hormones, maintains fluid and pH balance, grow, maintain, repate body tissues, provide energy
* Amino acids – building blocks
Using Protein for Energy
* When we do not consume enough calories to meet needs, body proteins are broken down since amino acids are not stored
Sources
* 1 cup milk = 8 g protein
* 1 egg= 6 g protein
* 3oz meat = 20+ g protein
* 1 slice bread =2 g protein
* 1/2 cup legumes = 6-10 g protein
* 1/2 cup rice, cereal, pasta = 2-3 g protein
* 10-35 % total calories should be from protein
* 0.8 g protein/kg weight (men)
Research
* Red meat intake = higher risk of coronary heart disease
* Low-carb + high protein – higher risk cardio for increased protein consumption
Side Effects
* High cholesterol, gout, strain on kidneys
Tips
* Olive or canola oil
* 1/4-1/2 cup of nuts
* Add olives to pasta, pizza, salad
* Dip bread in olive oil and vinegar
* Eat fatty fish such as salmon two-three times a week.
* Egg-white omelet using olive-oil, veggies, low-fat cheese
 
1.9 – Determning Individual Nutrient Needs
Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) 2010
* Balancing calories
* Enjoye our good, but eat less
* Avoid oversized portions
* Foods to Increase
* Make half your plate fruits and vegetables
* Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk
Calories Needed?
* Difference between us is because of weight, health conditions, etc
* Indirect calorimetry – measuers the amount of heat energy produced by an indiv by the oxygen produced/co2 eliminated
Harris-Benedict Equation (HBE)
* Most widely used equation
* Determine resting metabolic rate (RMR)
* RMR multiplied by activity factor/injury factor
* HBE predicts RMR within 10% of measured RDR in 69% of individuals
* More likely to overestimate needs that underestimate
* Cornell calculator
Men: RMR = 66.47 + 13.75(W) + 5(H) - 6.76(A)
Women: 655.1 + 9.56(W) + 1.7(H) - 4.7(A)
W = weight in kg
H is height in cm
A is age in years
Mifflin-St.Jeor Equation
* Most reliable for overweight/obese individual
* www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html
Calories per kilogram
* To lose weight – 20-25 calories per kg body weight
* To maintain weight – 25-30 calories per kg body weight
* To gain weight – 30-35 calories per kg body weight
Macronutrients
* Carb: 45-65%
* Fat: 20-35%
* Protein: 10-35%
Application
* 40 year old male, new dx T2 Diabetes
* 5'8", 200 lbs
* BMI: 30.4
* Desired outcome: weight loss
* Using 20-25 * 200, you need 2050 kcal/day
* Sample breakdown
* 55% carb =  281 g
* 25% fat = 57g
* 20% protein = 102.5g
1.10 – Dietary Supplements
US
* DSHEA act
* Supplements = category of foods vs drugs
* Supplements do not have to be proven to be sold
* Some supplements have 1000%, 2000% percent, etc.
Concerns
* May have amount of leads
* Have to check for current supps that are being used
Supplement savvy
* "Natural" means nothing
* "High-potency", "pharmacy-grade", "prescription-strength"
* Self-diagnosing is harmful
* More expensive supplements != better quality
* Some may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medications
Contradicture
* Vitamin K can reduce ability of blood t
* Going above the tolerable upper intake levels means you get harm
* "Promotes joint health" – Glucosamine – no benefit
* "Improves memory, focus" – Ginkgo evaluations of memory
* Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
* Twice-daily doses of 120 mg ginkgo extract did no better than placebo to slow cognitive decline over 6 years
* "Prevents aging"
* Resveratrol – antioxidant found in red wine
* Works in mice but no tests in humans
* Experiments in humans use 1 g/day = 667 bottles of red wine
* No long-term efficacy & safety of resveratrol
Who needs?
* Calorie restrictive – vitamin.mineral supplement
* Vegans, no dairy –B12, Ca, Vit D
* Infants, children – Fluoride, Vit D, Iron
* Pregnant women – 400 mcg folic acid
* Older adults – Vit B12
* Darker skin – Vit D
* Cigarette smokers – Vit C
* Alcohol abuses – B vits
* Medication – may interfere with normal vitamin/mineral metabolism
In Summary
* Just because you don't need a prescription doesn't means a supplement is harmless
* Changing diet/exercise is harder than popping a pill
* Most individuals can get nutrients from foods alone
 
2.2 – Therapeutic Lifestyle Change
Traditional
* Drugs/Lifestyle
Levels
* Total cholesterol <200 mg/dL
* LDL choles < 100mg/dL
* HDL choles <60 mdL
Risk factors
* Non-modifiable – Heredity, age, sex
* Diet, overweight, physical inactivity
* Men higher up to 50
Overweight
* Excess weight/less exercise raises LDL levels
* Excess weight/less exercise raises tricglyceride levels
* Excess weight/less exercise lowers their HDL levels
* Losing weight can help lower LDL & TG, increase HDL 
Diet
* Saturated, Trans fat, and cholesterol affect it
* Cholesterol = from animals only
TLC Diet
* 7% total calories
* 25-35% total calories
* Chol = <200 mg/day
* Sodium<2400 mg
* Calories: Healthy
It does decrease LDL
* 14 g sat fat = magic number
* 2 1/2 oz cheese
* 3 tablespoon lard
* 6 oz cooked ground beef
* 2 tbsp butter
Eggs?
* 1 egg = 186 mg cholesterol
* 7eggs/week
Niacin for cholesterol
* Can decrease cholesterol levels but may have this thing called niacin flush
2.3 – Dietary Fats and Heart Disease
Location of body fat
* Those who had more abdominal visceral fat had stiffer arteries than those with less
* Better to have fat in the butt/thigh area vs middle
Saturated fatty acids
* Meat, cheese, full fat dairy, ice cream, butter
Rankings of sat fat
* Regular cheese, pizza, grain-based desserts, diary, chicken, sausages, burgers, beef and fat milk
* The ones who consumed the most meat = 5 oz (3 oz = 1 computer mouse) = higher change to die of heart disease or cancer
* Lean meat – poultry and fish
* Fat doesn't get cooked off from margarine
* Poultry fat: thigh > wing > drumstring > breast
* Ground turkey or chicken may mean meat + skin. Check if it is breast only
* Reducing saturating fat has to be accompanied with
* High-fiber
* Whole grains
* Fruits
* Vegetables and lentils
Whole Milk
* Has a good amount of vitamins/minerals but there is 5 g saturated fat
* Trans fats – Junky snack foods/fast food 
Research diets
* South Beach, Ornish = less LDL but Atkins higher LDL
2.3 Readings
Harvard Fats and Cholesterol: Out with the Bad
* Good fats: vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, fish
* Bad fats: read meat, butter, cheese, ice cream
* Low fat diets sometimes are higher in refined carbohydrates and starches
2.4 – Essential Fatty Acids
* Essential because body cannot make them
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
* EPA: Fatty fish, salmon, herring
* DHA: Sardines – DHA: brain dev't
* Eat fish at least 2 times per week (if no CHD)
Fish oil
* No effect on dementia
Omega-6 Fatty Acids
2.5 – Dietary Fiber
High total dietary fiber intake linked to 40% lower risk of coronary heart disease and lower diabetes risk
* Plant matter that is indigestible in humans
* Soluble fiber associated with lower CVD (cardiovascular disease) risk
* Viscous soluble fibers modestly less LDL
* Dissolves in water – oats have the highest proportion of any grain
* Oatmeal, oat bran, beans, peas, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, strawberries, apple pulp
Soluble Fiber improves hyperlipidia by
* Delays gastric emptying
* Since they take longer to digest, they play a role in satiety and weight control
* Increases excretion of bile acids
* Binds with bile acids and remove from the body,  which stimulates liver to increase uptake from circulation to replenish supply, causing your HDL to decrease
* Decrease cholesterol synthesis
* Some soluble fibers, oligosaccharides are fermented in the lower gut, and may inhibit liver from producing cholesterol
* Promotes motility in gut and increases stool bulk
Men need higher fiber needs (38 grams) – may reduce colon cancer
How to eat 30g Fiber per Day
* Whole wheat toast – 3g, Pear – 5g, Berries – 6g, Lentil soup – 8g, Cup berries – 6g, Cup of carrots –3g
2.6 – The Mediterranean Diet
7 Countries Study

Principles of the Med Diet
* Plant-based diet with herbs & spices for flavor
* Limited red meat intake, focus on fish & poultry
* Low processed food intake
* Moderate daily and wine
* Olive oil
Med Diet Pyramid
* Be active, share with your family
* Fruits, grains, vegetables (whole grains)
* Little protein from fish/seafood
* Very limited: meat and sweets
* Not a low fat of the diet, but low saturated fat
* Alcohol – moderate consumption of wine (1-2 glasses of wine per day)

* Diabetic neuropathy – diabetes can cause numbness, tingling, and pain in the feet and increases the risk of skin damage due to altered sensation
Management
* DM is a chronic disease which cannot be cured except in very specific situations
* Management concentrates on keeping sugar levels close to normal
3.2 – Physical Activity and Weight in Diabetes
* Overweight: BMI 25-29
* Obese: BMI 29 and up
* The food that you eat turns into sugar
* Bigger fat cells impede your insulin from delivering sugar
2002 study

4.2 – Cancer Prevention
Cancer Statistics
* Lung, breast, colorectum, stomach, prostate, liver, cervix, esophagus, bladder, lymphoma
* Too many risks both globally, nationally, and locally
* 33% of cancers can be prevented
* As national income rises, obesity goes up
Recommendations
* 5 f/v a day
* Keep salt down
* Keep red meat down
* Not so many sweets
* Fiber/foods of plant origin
* Physical activity (150 minutes/week)
* Limit alcohol, processed meats, irradiated foods
* Weight loss
* Try to get your nutrition through diets alone
Notes
* Antioxidants: The body uses certain compounds in foods and chemicals made in the body called antioxidants to help protect against damage to tissues
4.3 – Diet and Cancer
Recommendations
* Eat at least 5 servings (400 oz) of a variety of non-starchy fruits/vegetables per day
* Eat unprocessed cereals and legumes
* Limit red meat (18 oz/week) (3oz = 1 deck of cards)
* Alcohol: 1/day for women, 2/day for men
* Salt – Avoid! Less than 6 g
* Avoid sugary drinks/consume energy-dense foods sparingly
* Maintain decent weight
4.4 – Antioxidants and Phytochemicals
* Phytochemicals: Wide variety of chemicals produced by plants
Polyphenols
* Include large subgroup called flavonoids
* Isoflavones: soy products, red clover, garbanzo – may mimic actions of female action estrogen
* Other polyphenols: act as antiox
* Cruciferous veggies: broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower
* Quercetin: in apples, onions, teas, red wine
* Ellagic acid: Raspberries, blackberries, strawberries
* Carotenoids: Dark yellow and dark orange f/v: Carrots, yams, cantaloupe, squash
* Lycopene: Cooked tomatoes, red peppers, pink grapefruit
* Lutein
* Allyl sulfides: Garlic/onions
4.5 – Diet and Colorectal Cancer
Risk Factors
* Convincing: Red meat, excess body weight, alcohol intake increases (male), physical activity increases
* Probable: alcohol intake increase for female
* Limit red meat to <18 oz (500 g) per week (3 oz = 1 deck of cards or 1 computer mouse)
* Heme iron in red meat may serve as a catalyst in the gut to generate free radicals, damaging DNA
* Carcinogens are formed during high heat cooking; processed meats often cooked at high heat
* Meat consumption is increasing everywhere
Fiber and Colon Cancer
* 10% risk reduction in colorectal cancer for each 10 g of fiber eaten per day
* Suggested that fiber from whole grains and cereals contributes more to reduction vs fruits and vegetables
* Nobody is arguing the fact about increasing your fruit and vegetable intake anyway
Calcium and Colorectal Cancer
* Calcium intake not related to total ca in men
* Males & females: dairy food & calcium was inversely associated with cancer of digestive system/colorectal cancer.
Exercise and Colon Cancer
* Men who engaged in sports or exercise at least 5 times per week had 20% lower risk colon cancer than men who rarely or never exercised
* 20% higher risk for men who watched TV or videos for 5-6 hours a day than men who didn't
Fiber and Colon Cancer: Following the Scientific Trail
* Some studies show an effect while some do not
* Cohort studies (studies taken over a period of time) suggested that fiber intake had very little, if any, link with colon cancer.
4.6 – Diet and Prostate Cancer
Prostate Cancer Risk Factors
* 2nd most common cancer (14% of all new cancer in men)
* Median age of diagnosis: 72
* Asian/Hispanic at lowest risk
* Higher incidence in N. America, Carribean, NW Europe, Australia
* Family history, diet, obesity, exercise, prostatitis, genetics all have links
Lycopene
* Can reduce risk of prostate cancer
* Recommends at least 5 portions a day of f/v
* Other studies show no link
Selenium
* Probable evidence that Se supplements use reduces prostate cancer risk
* Overall evidence on supplements and cancer is inconsistent
* Se content depends on the Se content of the soil
* Brazil nuts, oatmeal
Diet and Prostate Cancer
* Probable evidence that diets high in Ca increase risk
* Limited evidence that processed meat, milk, and dairy products increase risk
* Limited evidence that legumes – including soy – and foods with vitamin decrease risk
* Cruciferous vegetables – reduce risk
* Omega-3 fatty acid intake: increase intake associated with negative risk
 
Nutrition Impact of Prostate Ca
* Fetal incontinence
* Cryotherapy: Urinary fistula
* Radiation: Acuty cystitis
* Hormonal therapy: Diarrhea, nausea, hot flashes, osteoporosis, weigth gain
Selenium/Vitamin E supplements
* SELECT: Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer
* Both Selenium at Vitamin E didn't lower risk the prostate cancer vs placebo
Research: Milk and Prostate Ca
* At least 2 glasses non-fat milk had 23% > risk prostate cancer
* No link with low-fat milk
* Milk increases levels of insulin-like growth factor-1
* Higher levels of IGF assoc with increased potency of prostate cancer
Research: Calcium & Prostate Ca
* Higher risk of fatal prostate cancer for 1500-1999 mg Ca/day compared to those who got less than 750 mg/day
* Either food or supplement
Summary
* Lose, don't gain excess weigth
* Don't exceed recommended levels:
* Se: 55 mcg
* Vit E: 33 IU
* Ca: 1200 mg
* Zn: 11 mg
* Consume cooked tomatoes or tomato sauces along with other vegetables
4.7 – Diet and Breast Cancer
Breast Cancer Risk
* 2nd most common
* Age (increases risk)
* Alcohol (increases)
* Breastfeeding (decreases)
* Family (only 5-10% of all cases)
* Inactivity (post-menouposal)
* Excess weight increases risk
Research: Breastfeeding & Breast Ca
* Lower both for with familial and non-familial
* 4-6 months of breastfeeding
Soy Foods
* May increase or may decrease
* For breast Ca survivors looking to decreaes reliance on animal foods, soy foods are safe
* General guidelines are to avoid soy supplements
Fiber
* 5 % reduction in breast cancer for each additional 10 grams fiber per day consumed
* Inverse association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk.
Ca
* Osteoporosis is a concern
* Because of chemo, higher risk for osteo for women
* At most 1500 mg Ca and 400-800 IU VitD per day
Breast Ca Preventability
* Estimates that 38% of breast ca in the US could be prevented if women
* Maintain healthy weight
* Be physically active
* Drink less alcohol
* Breastfeed their babies
4.8 – Diet and Breast Cancer (Guest)
Prevention
* Maintain a healthy weight
* Exercise regularly
* Eat plant-based diet
* Breastfeed
Problems after diagnosis
* Nausea/fatigue
* Overweight/obesity 
* No answers figured out, part of it is the fatigue and the reduced activity levels
Soy food
* Contain isoflavones which is similar to estrogen
* Either at risk or decreasing or post-
* Safe to consume 1-2 servings of whole tofu a day
* Several human studies verify that
* No to soy supplements (nothing to say that soy prevents breast ca)
Breast ca survivorship
* Healthy breast ca survivor: weigth management is important
* Focus not just on cutting calories but eating healthier foods
* Switch to whole grains, limit red meats, watching portion sizes
* Alcohol: limit (even 1 drink  a day) (3 or more drinks per week = higher reoccurence)
* Consuming 2 1/2 veg + 30 minutes exercise = decreased mortality
4.9 – Alcohol and Cancer
Alcohol & Cancer Link
* Esophagus, mouth/throat, pre/post-menopausal in men, bowel cancer in men, probable in women, liver, colorectal, damages DNA cells during alcohol breakdown
* Produced carcinogenic compounds
* Raises levels of some hormones such as estrogen
Alcohol & Non-cancer Risk
* Heart disease, hypertension, stroke, osteoporosis, malnutrition, pancreatic inflammation, brain damage, liver cirrhosis, accidents, birth defects
Alcohol Research Considerations
* All studies of alcohol & cancer is just observational
* Can't prove cause & effect
* Can't precisely say where risk threshold is
* Can be strongly suggestive
Research: Alcohol & Breast Ca
* Women drinking 3-6 drinks/week were 15% more likely to develop breast ca than non-drinkers
* For women who drank 6-19 drinks/week,  increased risk was 20%
* More than 19 drinks/week, 50%
4.10 – Debunking Diet & Cancer Myths
Complimentary Health Practices (CAM)
* 40% of cancer survivors report using complementary practice
* (Natural products, deep breathing, meditation)
Why CAM in Cancer Care?
* Help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain and fatigue
* Comfort themselves and ease stress
* Feel they are doing something to treat their own cancer
Dietary Supplements
* Very unclear about benefits for lowering risk or improving outcomes after diagnosis
* Herbal supplements can act like drugs in your body
Megadosing
* 10 x RDA
* Excess Vit C = copper deficiency
* Excess P = impair Ca absorption
* Excess Vits A, D, K = toxic (non-fat soluble)
* Excess Vit E = all-cause mortality
Myths
* Natural products are best – the word "natural" means nothing (non-legally enforceable)
* Plants contain many chemicals and compounds
* Plant-based products may in theory be helpful, but how does that translate to the supplement?
* Sugar feeds cancer – Not true, sugar can only increase risk in that it contributes to excess weight gain
* Milk and dairy cause cancer – Low amounts of Ca (200 mg/day) and milk may protect vs breast cancer
* Ca at levels > 1500 mg/day may possibly increase prostate cancer risk
* Microwaving food in plastic wrap – There are no dioxins in plastic.
* Avoid food contact with wrap if microwaving.
* Reusing plastic water bottles – None of this information has ever been published
* Superfoods – There is no one super food or something.
4.11 – Nutrition Needs in Cancer
Cancer Affects Nutrition Status
* Brain & Nervous System: Chewing & swallowing difficulties, headaches, altered taste (dysgeusia) and smell, difficulty with self-feeding
* Head & Neck: Swallowing difficulty, aspiration, inflamed mucosa, dry mouth, altered taste or smell
* Esophagus: Swallowing difficulty, aspiration, obstruction, GERD, inflamed mucosa
* Stomach: Anorexia & early satiety, less HCl Production & kess IF production, delayed stomach emptying, dumping syndrome, malabsorption, nutrient deficiencies
* Intestine: Inflamed mucosa and bacterial overgrowth, obstuction, lactose intolerance, malabsoption, bile insufficiency, nurient deficiencies, fluid & electrolyte imbalances
* Pancreas: Lower digestive enzyme secretion, bile insufficiency, malabsorption, nutrient deficiencies, hyperglycemia
Metabolic Changes in Cancer
* Protein: Higher protein turnover rate and lower muscle protein synthesis, body will break down its own muscle
* Lipids: Faster breaking down
* Unintended weight loss: (10% body weight over 6 months) Anorexia occurs in 15-25% of patients at the time of diagnosis
Nutitional Needs
* Calories
* Obese: 21-25 kcal/kg
* Sedentary: 25-30 kcal/kg
* Slightly hypermetabolic: 30-35 kcal/kg
* Severely hypermetabolic: >35 kcal/kg
* Protein
* Normal: 1.0 g/kg
* Non-stressed 1-1.5 g/kg
* Bone marrow trasnplant 1.5 g/kg
* Extreme wasting or hypermetabolism 1.5-2.5 g/kg
* Fluid: 30-35 ml/kg
To add calories/protein, add
* Butter/margarine
* Condiments like mayo
* Cream and whole milk
* Nuts
* Beverages between meals
* Cheese
* Eggs
* Meats
* Oral supplements between meals
 
4.12 – Nutrition Tips for Cancer Management
Most common nutrition problem
* Really dependent and the side effects are varied
* Some eating challenge (nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite)
Recommendations
* Eat smaller meals throughout the day
* Separate liquids from solids
* To combat alternate tastes, eat colder food and avoid animal meat (less metal), drink milk
* Don't eat your favorite foods before you have your chemotherapy, the favorite food might get associated with nausea
* To counteract weight loss, eat more often, and drink more nutritious liquids such as smoothies and low-fat dairy alternatives
* Focus on more nutrition-dense foods
* Supplements: tricky because they may interfere with the chemo or radiation, although taking a normal multivitamin may work
* 100% case by case basis
* Side effects persist after the chemotherapy etc (may take months)
* Post-cancer survivors: most motivated group ever  (huge asset)
* Start small and measurable goals
* Try to maintain weight throughout treatment
* Think of food as fuel or medicine
 
5.1 – Defining Obesity (Notes)
Facts
* 1.4 billion adults are overweight, 200M men and 300M women obese
* WHO definition: BMI > 25 = overweight, BMI > 30 = obese
* 2.8 M adults die each year from being overweight/obese, 44% of diabetes, 23% of CAD, and 7-41% of some cancers attributable
Causes
* Increased intake of energy-dense foods high in fat, salt, and sugars bu low in vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients
* Decrease in physical activity due to increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work
Consequences
* Increase risk for: CAD, diabetes, muscle/skeletal disorders, cancers (endometrial, breast, colon)
* Problem for low-middle income countries: both infectious and noncommunicable disease risk factors are there
How can it be reduced?
* Limit energy intake from total fats
* Increase consumption of f/v, legumes, whole grains, nuts
* Limit sugar intake
* Engage in regular physical activity
* Achieve energy balance/healthy weight
5.2 – Energy Balance
Excessive body weight
* Psychiatric/psychological problems
* Cardiovascular
* Asthma
* Gestation problems
* Arthritis
Energy in and energy out (calories eaten vs calories burned)
* Intake:
* Protein
* Fat
* Carbohydrates
* Alcohol
* Output:
* Basal Metabolism (greatest contributor)
* Thermic Effect of Food
* Physical Activity – 15-30%
* Thermogenesis (very small, food to keep body temp stable)
* Exercising on a regular basis increases your basal metabolism
Resting Metabolism (Resting energy expenditure)
* Lean body mass
* Male has greater >%LBM
* Body temp (fever increases)
* Age (2% in REE for every decade after 30 years)
* Energy restriction
* Genetics (some predesposition here)
* Endocrine (hypothyroid)
Storage of Excess Calories?
* Any excess calorie can be stored as fat
* No storage mechanism for protein, it is stored as fat (if excess calories)
Metabolic Fitness
* Not what's your BMI but what's going on inside internally
* Need low triglyceride, HDL, bp
 
5.3 – Metabolic Syndrome
What is
* A group of risk factors
* Increases risk of
* Coronary artery disease
* Stroke
* T2 diabetes
Criteria Need to have 3 to have metabolic syndrome
* Males > 40 inches waist circum
* Females > 35 inches waist circum
* High bp (130/85)
* Hight sugar >110 mmHg
* Trigly > 150 mmHg
* More dangerous for people who get fat in the abdominals as opposed to those in the thighs
* Increases risks for the risk of heart attack in both men and women
5.4 – Pediatric Obesity
* 1:6 US children obese, 1:3 overweight/obese
* Since 1980, childhood obesity has tripled
* As countries' weight increases, more tendency to be obese
BMI-for-age
* BMI for children takes age into account
* Underweight: <5th per
* Healthy: 5th-85th
* Overweight:85th-95th
* Obese: 95th onw
Effects
* Higher T2 Dia
* Higher CAD
* Higher bone/joint problems
* More likely to be obese adults
* Higher risk of cancer in adulthood
Approach
* School-based nutrition
* Wellness programs in communities
* Nutrition assistance programs
* Food marketing to children
* Screen time
* Safe neighborhoods and built environment
* Access to sugar-sweetened beverages
Harvard's Healthy Wt Checklist
* Eat well
* Stay active
* Limit screen time (1-2 hours per day, children <2 no screen)
* Get enough sleep
* Good behavior during pregnancy
5.5 – Eating Disorders (Jessica Setnick)
Characteristics of people with eating disorders
* No discrimination
* Hard to diagnose
* Personality: perfectionism, lack of confidence, change in mental stability
* At the core, causes are unknown (something brain related but might start from a stressful thing)
* Some diseases are consequences from eating disorders
* Eating disorders are more common in places with more people
* To deal with: Set aside time to talk with the person, don't blame them but observe them
5.6 – Sugar and Chronic Metabolic Disease (Robert Lustig)
* How can we explain obesity for babies?
* Ex: schizophrenia was seen as a personality disorder for 100 years, turns out it was dopamine problem
* Insulin blocks the signal that conveys satiety. By blocking the satiety receptor we just recur the problem of too much food eaten.
* Global insulin levels have increased.
* No change in genes but change in diet
* Glucose – you die without this, body actually creates if you lack this
* Galactose – you die without this
* Fructose – Not regulated by insulin
* Overwhelming energy from fructose (sweetened beverages) makes the liver overload and create liver fat. This can lead to CAD, diabetes, cancer...
* HFCS (high fructose corn syrup = problem!
* Fruits: High fiber = low fructose
* Processed food is fiberless food. Fiber decreases shelf life which is a problem. Eat the fruit, don't eat the juice.
* Two kinds of fiber = you need both, adds a layer which prevents nutrients from getting absorbed by the body, so you eat but don't get fat
* As long as you turn a fruit into a smoothie, you destroy the soluble fiber.
Sugar metabolic effects
* Sweet stuff – Fructose
* Drives mitochondrial dysfunction
* Acts on the brain to promote continued consumption by increasing reward
* Part of brain which emphasizes reward (where drugs act)
* More chronic exposure means higher reward, and you get higher tolerance.
How to fix
* EAT REAL FOOD.
* The highest concentration of sugar = cannot be eaten.
* There is a threshold for the sugar intake.
* Need to get the fucking sugar out of the food.
* Not all calories are the same.
NO STUDY EVER SAYS THAT EXERCISE DOES NOT CAUSE WEIGHT LOSS. EXERCISE MAKES YOU LOSE FAT AND INCREASE MUSCLE, RESULTING IN NO WEIGHT CHANGE. DIET CAUSES WEIGHT LOSS.
5.6 Notes
* We are fatter and more are fatter
* Total caloric intake is higher for both male and female
* Not due to food but due to imbalance in our homeostasis saying that "hey you're full already"
* Our fat from calories has gone down
* Drinking 6.5 oz of coke every day = 8 lbs/yr
* Drinking 12 oz = 16 lb/yr
* Coke has salt (diuretic) to increase thirst, just hidden under the sugar
* Removed vending machines, lower obesity prevalence
* HFCS = super super sweet (100 times sweet)
* Easier to break down fructose bounds
* HFCS = same as sugar, both dangerous
* It is not just empty calories it is a poison by itself.
* 3 winds
* Nixon wants to make food cheaper
* HFCS invented in 196 and American market 1975
* Juice causes obesity T_T
* Keys vs Yustig
* Keys: fat = increased CVD?
* Not just fat, in fact it is sugar
* LDLs: 2 types, dense LDL blocks the arteries while non-dense = okay
Adulteration of food supply
* Addition of fructose
* We took out fiber because it causes decreased shelf life
Fructose is not glucose
* 7 times more likelier than glucose to change the colors
* Fructose does not suppress satiety hormone
* Chronic fructose promotes the metabolic syndrome
What happens when you take in glucose
* Of 120 cal 96 to body 20 to liver
* Liver stores glucose as glycogen
* Liver can take any amount of glucose because it is safe
* Liver and glucose tells you to stop eating
What happens when you take in fructose
* Example is a juice (this is sucrose which is half fructose and half glucose
* Only the liver can metabolize fructose.
* Fructose does not use insulin.
* Fructose eventually become uric acide which causes gout and hypertension
* As sugar consumption goes up, uric acide and BP goes up
* Sports drinks contain HFCS because they can replete the glycogen faster
* Fructose makes you fat
* A high sugar diet is a high fat diet.
* 6 days to see the effect of a high HFCS diet
* Asahan mo na if you eating fructose would FUCK WITH YOUR BRAIN
Clinic intervention
* No sugared liquids–only water and milk
* Eat your carbohydrate with fiber
* Wait 20 minutes for second portions (to get that satiety in)
* Buy your screen time minute-for-minute with physical activity
* The more sugar beverages the less intervention worked
Why is exercise important?
* Not to lose weight its just too weak to lose a significant amount of weight
* It improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity
* Reduces stress and resultant cortisol release
* It makes the TCA cycle run faster, and detoxifies fructose etc
Why is fiber important in obesity
* Sugarcane is actually healthier lol (it has fiber)
* Reduces the rate of intestinal carbohydrate absorption, reducing insulin response
* Increases speed of transit of interstinal contents to ileum, to induce satiety
* Inhibits absorption of some free fatty acids to the colon, which are metabolized by colonic bacteria to short-chain fatty acids which suppress insulin
McD's menu items with no HFCS
* French fries, Hash browns, Chicken McNuggets, Sausage, Diet Coke, Coffee, Iced tea
Realizations
* Keys was not checking the fat but checking the fructose :)
* Diets won't work if you eat a ton of fructose
* US won't be able to export food if HFCS is outlawed
Summary
* Fructose (sucrose vs HFCS) consumption has coincided with the obesity epidemic
* Not all calories are equal. Fructose =/= glucose.
* You are not what you eat; you are what you do with what you eat.
5.7 – Surgical Weight Loss
* Diet after surgery = liquid protein supplement. 64 ounces needs to be sipped all day long.
* Progress to soft protein, ground beef, flaked  fish, etc
* Need to have 50% to 70% protein
* People might think they are hungry when they are just dehydrated.
5.8 – Health at Every Size
* Weight is almost always the standard for measuring health.
* Even if you have the same BMI and weight you may be healthy or not healthy.
* BMI is actually very inaccurate (nearly 50%) for studying health.
Myth: Fat Causes Disease
* Several diseases are associated with obseity, but this doesn't mean that fat causes disease.
* A LOT of factors come into play, not just overweightedness. In fact, dieting itself could cause health problems.
* Not just about weight. You can be fit even while obese.
* Hit fitness levels as opposd to weights.
Socioeconomic Status
* Poverty is much more strongly associated with T2D than weight.
* Insulin resistance that underlies T2d causes weight gain.
Myth: Diet, exercise, or surgery are effective for sustained weight loss
* No exercise, diet, or sugary study has ever demonstrated long term maintenance of weight loss for any but a small minority.
* People generally gain the weight back.
* Body is "used" to a certain weight.
* Body slows down your metabolism. Fuck you, body.
Health at every size
* Weight neutral
* Support body acceptance
* Encourage nourishing lifestyle habits.
* Intuitive eating
* Joyful movement
* Meaningful work
* Supportive relationships/community
* Stress management.
* Supports development of stereotype management skills
* Committed to social justice, institutio nal and cultural change
 
6.2 – Nutrition Digestion and Absorption
What does the GI Tract Do?
* Receives food
* Separates nutrients from food
* Transports nutrients via blood
* Excretes indigestible waste
System
* Mouth: Starts both physical/chemical digestion
* Stomach: Churns the food
* Liver: Bile (important to digest fat)
* Pancreas: Bicarbonate (neutralize intestinal contents from the acidic stomach), digest carbo, protein, fat
* Gallbladder: Stores bile and releases into small intestine
* Small intestine: Absorbing nutrients
* Large intestine: Water and minerals are absorbed
* Peristalsis: Alam na yan
The Stomach
* 2 sphincters – Lower esophageal sphincter and pyloric sphincter
* Primary nutrients absorbed: Water, alcohol, minerals (Cu, I, Fl, Mo)
* More of mechanical mixing rather than digestion
The Stomach's Gastric Juices
* HCl – Denatures protein/activates pepsin
* Pepsin – Digests protein
* Gastric lipase – Digests fat
* Mucus – Protect stomach from digesting itself
Small Intestine
* Main site for digestion/absorption
* Bolus after stomach = chyme
* Duodenum – Ca, K, Mg, Fe, Cu, Vit A, D, E, K, thia, ribo, nia, biotin, folate
* Jejunum – Same as duo but has lipids, carbs, proteins
* Ileum – Mg, C, B12...
* Important to check to know which part of gut process nutrients to know which nutrient you are deficient if you get gut damage
The Large Intestine
* Colon+rectum
* Water, vitamins/minerals are absorbed here
* Intestinal microflora break down fiber, synthesize B and K
6.3 – FODMAPS Approach to IBS Management
* IBS = Irritable Bowel Syndrome
* FODMAPS = Foods that contain compounds that contain carbs that are poorly absorbed in the guts
* Carbs that increase pressure in the gut that increase GI disease
* Presence of FODMAPs does not necc result in higher rates of IBS but approach to minimizing FODMAPS represents a dietary approach to reducing IBS
FODMAPs in foods
* Fructose > glucose: honey, apples, pears, mango...
* Fructans: wheat, rye, onion
* Galactans: Cabbage, legumes
* Lactose: milk
* Polyols: Fruits, prunes, mushrooms, lychees
Low FODMAP: Nutrition Concerns
* Calcium, Vitamin D (fewer milk,drink lactose-free milk)
* Fiber intake: (oatmeal, oat bran, rice bran, strawberries, blueberries, orange, spinach)
* Most fiber-rich foods = FODMAPs food
Research: Low FoDMAPs
* Low F reported positive results vs standardized group
6.4 – Celiac Disease and the Gluten-free Diet
* CD: Gluten makes villus atrophise. People will have difficulty digesting nutrients.
* Prevalence: 1:100 in US & Europe but only 1:4700 diagnosed
Symptoms
* Variable: some are sensitive and some are not
* General irritable bowel
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Itchy skin
* Infertility
* Intestine actually heals itself
Diagnosing Celiac
* Biopsy of small intestine
* Eat gluten before the antibody test to not produce a false negative
Micronutrient Effects
* Concern about Fe, Ca, folate
* Lactose intolerance
* Def in fat-soluble vitamins, B12
What is Gluten?
* Found in wheat, rye, barley.
* Processed oats (sometimes add gluten), raw oats don't have
Gluten Free Diet
* Beans, cereals, corn, f/v, meat (no bread), milk-based, oats, rice
* None CD people find that they lose weight when they go on a gluten free diet
6.5 –Diets for Diverticular Disease
* Diverticulosis vs Diverticulitis
* Diverticula = gaps in colon
Risk factors
* History of constipation
* High red meat intake
* Low fiber intake
* Low physical activity
* Obesity
Diverticulosis
* Goal is to prevent inflammation and diverticulitis
* High fiber diet recommended
Diverticulitis (inflamed diverticula)
* Nothing by mouth and bowel rest until bleeding resolves
* Progress to clear liquid diet and may require supplemental nutrition
* Gradually increase dietary fiber etc
 
6.6 – Constipation, Intestinal gas, Diarrhea
Constipation: Causes
* Lack of dietary fiber
* Fiber supplements without adequate fluid
* Obesity, physical inactivity
* Pregnancy, disease state
* Medications
Constipation & Dehydration
* Increase fiber intake and water (proportional)

* 1 ml fluid/calorie or 25-30 ml/kg body weight
Constipation: Other Approaches
* Physical activity
* Probiotics & prebiotics
* Bulk-forming agents
* Psyllium
* Calcium polycarbophil
* Methylcellulose
Intestinal Gas
* Swallowing of air
* Breakdown of certain undigested foods by bacteria in the colon
* Causes: Either simple sugars, starches, and fiber
Simple sugars that cause gas
* Fructose
* Lactose
* Raffinose (found in dried beans, cabbage, Brussel sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, whole grains)
* Sorbitol (fruits and artificial sweeteners)
Gas From Fiber
* Soluble fiber
* Not digested by the body but fermented by bacteria in the colon
* Slowly increase fiber by a few grams/day (if you bump it rapidly then the bacteria would increase)
 
Additional Precautions
* Avoid
* Chewing food quickly
* Drinking straws
* Gum
* Tobacco
* Improper denture fit
* Carbonated drinks
* Try
* Small frequent meals
* Avoid fatty fried foods
* Physical activity
Diarrhea
* Rapid weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, acid-base imbalances
* Long period = malabsorptive disorder
* "Loose watery stools" or "> 200 ml stool"
* 2nd leading cause of death < 5 years
* Oral rehydration solution (ORS): Mix with water to replenish electrolytes
Causes
* Food can cause but most probably infection
* Beans, high fiber/fat, alcohol, lactose, fructose, caffeine, sorbitol
Dietary Management
* Restore normal fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance
* Slow gut motility
* Thicken consistency of stool
* Repopulate gut with normal flora
* Eventual stimulation of GI tract w/o exacerbating symptoms
The BRAT Diet
* Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Tea/Toast
* No scientific evidence
 
6.7 – GERD Peptic Ulcer Disease and Hiatal Hernias
Gerd
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (food from stomach goes back to esophagus)
* Avoid foods that lower the sphincter pressure

Peptic Ulcer Disease
* Caused by Helicobacter pylori, aspirin, and other pain relievers
* Occur not from foods or stress
* Symptoms: Pain and bleeding
* Treatment: Antibiotics
* Reduced appetite, unintentional weight loss
Management:
*  Small, frequent meals
* Avoid high-fat fried foods
* Drinking milk aka "sippy diet" doesn't work it exacerbates it
Hiatal Hernia
* Part of the stomach slips above the esophagus.
* Avoid high-fat foods, eat small/frequent meals, avoid lying down, lose weight
6.8 – Food Allergies
* Human immune system's abnormal response to a food protein
* Intolerance = side effects but you aren't going to die. You can die from an allergy.
Big 8 sources: Milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nut, fish, crustacean shellfish
Symptoms
* Tingling sensation in mouth
* Swelling of tongue/throat
* Difficulty breathing
* Hives/vomiting
* Ab cramps, diarrhea
* Drop in blood pressure
* Loss of consciousness
* Death
Diagnosis
* Skin prick or blood test, test vs individual's history
Prognosis
* Children may outgrow allergies to milk, egg, soy, and wheat
* Peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish = lifelong :(
FALCPA
* Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, put in plain language
 
6.9 – Dysphagia
* Disruption of swallowing
* Indicator of one or more disorders
Causes
* Stroke
* Nervous system disorder
* Age
* Head injury
* Cleft palate
* Cancer of head/neck/chest
* Dementia, memory loss, cognitive decline
Phases
* Oropharengeal: Problem transferring food from mouth & pharynx to esophagus
* Can be result of problem with tongue, swallowing reflex, mouth tissues
* Can't swallow or coughs when swallowing or regurgitation of contents
* Results in bad breath, hoarse voice, speech disorder
* Esophageal: Problem transferring from esophagus to stomach
* Food is "stuck" in esophagus
* Can be result of esophageal stricture, tumor or pressure from surrounding area
* Achalasia: Weakens LES
Management
* Either pureeing, altering, etc of food
* Thicker liquids (patients might choke)
* Speech therapy helps patients relearn or strengthen
6.10 – Probiotics and Prebiotics
* Probiotics
* Friendly bacteria, supports growth/repopulation of health gut flora
* Prebiotics
* Nondigestible food ingredients
* Feed the good bacteria in the system: oats, fruits, grains, veggies
* Because antibiotics kill good bacteria some people add probiotics to their diet
Sources
* Yogurt, tempeh, miso, kimchi
* Supplements
Recommended Dosing
* Different based on person to person
* Largely unregulated
