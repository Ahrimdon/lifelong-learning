# Principles of Game-Based Learning

## Empowered Learners

Nobody does anything unless they think what they do matters.

AGENT or Co-design Principle: The learning must feel like an agent in what they matter. Even in playing a game, you are co-designing the game because what you do in a game affects a game. What you do affects the game state. To be a successful player, you have to be a successful designer.

__Customization:__ If there isn’t a way to customize the learning experience, then it lowers the sense of “mattering” and agency. Good games allow people to do things in different ways. Good games also invite you to try a new style!

__Identity:__ When you are asked to learn algebra, everyone should have the right to ask "why should I learn this and what sort of people use this". The beginning of learning is "who am I going to be and what am I going to get when I learn this". Games are very good at creating identity: they give you an avatar, clear goals, clear roles, and a clear sense of what you are going to be. Learning should be an invitation to become a new type of person.

__Manipulation:__ They allow you as a player to manipulate the game world in a VERY fine way, there is a lot of control. When humans feel they can manipulate something in a very fine way, they almost feel as if their body has gone to that space. This is why people jump when they jump in Mario. In fact, the game offers you tools to truly involve your mind and body, and humans offer good tools.

## Problem-Based Learning

Learning in school is sometimes about passing tests and getting stuff in your head, which is not that good since in real life, you actually need to solve problems.

__The Fish Tank:__ When trying to fix problems, you have to deal with complexity. To study the Mississippi river, you can get a small fish tank to make things less complex. Games do this always.

__Sandboxes:__ This is an opportunity to be in a safe place but it feels that you are in a dangerous place. So you can try stuff without being judged by others. Learners need time to explore before they can level up.

__Problem Solving:__ School today is not about solving problems but about learning facts. You can get test passes but it doesn't correlate to being actually able to use them to solve problems. If you use formulas and formulas as TOOLS for solving problems, then you get both: retention of the fact and problem solving. Games are just problem spaces with excellent tools to solve shit. A game also has a good win state.

__Well-Ordered Problems:__ The method of sequencing the problems affect how we think about how to solve the problems. Sometimes this leads to creative solutions. This is game level design. 

__Pleasantly Frustrating:__ Learning for human beings is best when it is pleasantly frustrating: you feel a challenge, but you know that with effort you can solve it. The frustration is not stressing you because you know you can solve it, eventaully. When you are at the _regime of confidence_, you feel good, especially when you are at the edge of this area.

__Information Just In Time and On-Demand:__ Language/information is effective when it is given just in time or on-demand. "Get it when you need it, get it when you can use it, and repeat it." "I need a book right now." Verbal information should be just in time and on-demand, not in big blocks.

__Cycle of Expertise:__ Give a person a challenging problem, and they practice it over and over until they can do it and it becomes routine knowledge. When you give a person a new problem, they have to rethink and figure out new knowledge, and then they have to practice that, slowly. That's why games have boss battles. Everything you know before doesn't work anymore.

## Deep Understanding: Knowledge has to be stored deeply in your head.

__Situated Meaning/Meaning as Action:__ You are given words in school. But how do words get meaning? In school, we think that words get meaning by other words (dictionary). People really understand a word when they can associate a noun or an action. It’s easier to understand things by experiencing them.

__Systems Thinking:__ Most problems have to deal with complex systems. We're trying to understand how many variables interact in separate ways. Games are very good because it is a complex system. In fact, good players try to build a model in their head of "how does this game work and how do I get to game the goals and think of something that the designer didn't think of." Model-based reasoning is the foundation of scientific thinking.

__Skills as Strategies:__ We know that you master some basic skills and practice them. The problem with school is that these drills are boring and unengaging. You want the person to be accomplishing something, but they need to practice skills over and over again.

## Closing

What teaching is supposed to be is designing learning for other people. Teachers and game designers are designers of learning.

Games are not the only tool. We want to learn, how do we design good learning. Learning involves resources, mentors, text...

# 1.1-1.2: Welcome to Video Games & Learning

Games are actually good problem solving mechanisms, and that learning doesn’t just happen in the classroom. They are more than just a media or resource, but something you learn within and through interacting with.

Good games are possibility spaces in which we get good at doing new kinds of things and becoming new kinds of people.

Good learning within games enables us to become knowledge producers, and give us ideas and knowledge.

Sometimes, playing games means you get to learn stuff which you wouldn’t know before (pirate games give you pirate ideas). __So with modern technology, why couldn’t we make experiences around “being a…” (such as being a pirate)?__

Games also have this idea of removing the boring parts and give you a direction of what’s going to happen.

# 1.3: Games as Well-Defined Problems

__Games are well-defined problems:__ There’s a way of solving this and there’s a way to solve this.

Computational cognitive science: You model how people solve the problem using a computer and symbolic processing.

With complex tasks such as writing an essay, it’s harder to apply computational models. The social and material context becomes a wrapper to solve a problem.

Our brain solves problems differently when it is able to have tools to assist it (we solve algebra differently when we are alone versus when we have a calculator versus when we have a computer).

Games provide a compelling reason to measure the “social and material contexts”.

There are several configurations that are possible when you want to solve the problem of “killing a boss”. Tank + DD + DD + healer?

What does it also mean to be a good tank or healer? It’s not just knowing the right configuration, it also means that you have to be known socially.

We have to consider not just the well-defined problems, but the ill-defined problems of interpretation.

# 1.4: Games as Designed Experiences

Models such as Tauren druids = “what the heck is this, what does I mean to be this type of character”. You also have a lot of participation with other people and there is actually a real social sphere.

Games encourage you to be a part of organizations (social).

Games also encourage you to produce knowledge (it allows you to become more productive). We want kids to be playing games where they can participate in social guilds, and then taking the role of designer.
 
# 1.5: Games & Learning Trajectories
 
All of these advanced things are based on social contexts (mentors, party members, friends).We need to be thinking of people in a given social context.
 
The things we do in games also affect what we think we are good at in life.
 
# 2.2: Game Design for Learning

## Phases

* Concept Phase
	* What are the learning goals? Who is the audience? What is the game going to look like? 
	* Use visuals to communicate content. (Ex: we have to make sure that the game is gender-neutral).
	* Build on what players already know, and user test with the target audience.
	* Work directly with the content experts (game designers become experts on the content).
* Design Phase
	* Marry game mechanics and story to learning goals.
	* Content learning embedded in gameplay.
	* Gameplay is problem solving to overcome obstacles.
* Prototyping Phase
	* “Did we get the content right?”

# 2.3: Game Design Science

Ex: Lake Mendota (real lake) might become eutrophic. So in the game, as a player, you go there in 2020, when it is no longer swimmable. You’re a middle school kid, not a scientist, but you use scientist-type stuff. There is also a lake simulator.

“Preparation for future learning”: Playing games might mean that when you encounter something about the game’s context, you are better equipped to learn about the context (in this case lake).

Exp: Kids were split into 2 groups: the control was shown a research packet and then asked to play, while the experimental was asked to play then shown the research packet. There were decidedly higher scores for the experimental group.

# 2.4: Playtesting and Game Design

__If you’re not willing to let someone play with your thing, then you’re not able to know if it’s good or not.__ Even just paper prototyping just lets you get something out. Ideas have to be compelling even at pen and paper.

Sometimes, you can’t ask why they didn’t like the game. You can’t design from statistics. You design from the heart.

People hate “brick walls”. What we do is to make the people just progress slowly.

Failure should be entertaining. If the game laughs with you, you feel better. “While you are here, enjoy yourself.”

Games for learning should feel like learning.

__If I’m asking how can I make this fun, I’m asking the wrong question. If I’m asking where is the fun in this, I’m asking the right question.__

#2.5: Situated Learning & Place-Based Games

Mentorship: Learning is not the transfer of ideas from one to the other.

Games are a joint activity. There’s no video game that is alone. Games are problem-solving elements and are very social.

Concept is the method of beating the game.

Ex: (IPhone) What if the screen is tiny, but the physical world is the actual game world?

Ex: (Place-based) Games can be used to re-engage the player into the local context.

# 2.6: Control and Customization

Why do kids find environments such as Minecraft or The Sims powerful (in the way that some ways adults didn’t)? __They have freedom in these environments.__ They have control over the virtual places when they didn’t in physical places. Customization is limited in the physical world.

This is very empowering for kids. Adults are privileged because we can do things to change our surroundings.


# 3.1: Week 3

Novice physics students categorize things on basic features ("does it have a pulley or does it have a plane") while expert teachers categorize on deep structural features such as "did it use the same equation for force to solve it.

If you're not a game player, you most probably see surface features (color or "does it contain a gun") but game players see structural features. (These are significant in terms of their experiment.)

# 3.2: Games as Third Places

MMOGs (but most games in particular) function as third places especially for the youth. 

Putnam (2000) said that media is displacing civic and social institutions, there is a decline of trust over the years, and media (TV, games) helps reinforce this image.

Oldenburg's thid place: the first place is the home, the second place is work, and the third place is a place where you can engage socially where you are not encumbered by your identity at home (as a family member) and as work. He writes about "third place" as the people's own remedy for stress, loneliness, and alienation".

The city structure in America is suburban-city center with not that much city centers so it is less easier to meet people you won't normally meet. Then in the name of efficiency, schools and workplaces have repetitive tasks and people are arranged in cubicles/rows.

Oldenburg: _The home entertainment industry thrives in the dearth of the informal public life among the American middle class... demand for all manner of electronic gadgetry to substitue vicarious watching and listening for more direct involvement is high._

Characteristics of a third place according to Oldenburg:

* __Neutral ground.__ People there are not obligated to be there financially etc.
* __Leveler.__ _"It didn't matter what you drove to the arcade. If you suck at Asteroids, you suck."_ It's what you can do, not how rich you are.
* __Conversation is the main activity.__ Yes.
* __Accessibility & accomodation.__ MMOGs are available 24/7.
* __The regulars.__ Usually the clan members. 78% of MMOGamers join a clan.
* __A low profile.__ Games, even if it still has fanciful graphics, can be homely when people leave the game for newer games.
* __Mood is playful.__ Self-exp.
* __Home away from home.__ Seamon (1979)'s 5 defining traits: rootedness, feelings of possession, spiritual regeneration, feelings of being at ease, and warmth. Rootedness: People actually care for each other (guildmates).

# 3.3: Games as Third Places: Games as Social Capital

Bonding vs. bridging. Bonding is with your close friends and family, with close intimate support, they are often with people who are like you. Bridging is you get to share ideas with your random friends, these are people who are probably not people you lean on for support. These relationships are where you run in to different kinds of people (other social class, other race, other geographical location).

In online research, there is a tendency for people to look for sources that agree with our world view. In games, you actually get to interact with other people that may not share the same world views.

# 3.4: Apprenticeship

## Features of Apprenticeship + Lineage

Context: Myr is helping Jellybean which is a super newbie.

* Engage in joint participation. Myr guides Jellybean on surviving.
* Highly valued & routine activity. Myr signals to Jellybean that getting Mithril is important.
* Mutually understood goal and activity.
* Master scaffolds learning (structure at the start then lessen as the apprentice gets better): Myr knows what to do.
* Sequences instruction. After learning how to avoid an orc, Jellybean is taught how to collect drops.
* Repeated opportunities for practice & situated feedback: Myr tells Jellybean she is successful.
* Focuses learner's attention on key aspects of context.
* Master entruts more control to the learner.
* Information given "just in time", no quizzes.
* Myr keeps activities
* __Master elf's actions are tied to a particular set of values.__ The master enculturates the apprentice into both practice and the ideology of how to be an elf. What's imporant?
	* Procedural dexterity: keyboard mechanics.
	* Mentorship
	* Efficiency: No wasted motion.
	* Virtual material good: No losing mithril.
	* Equal distribution of opportunity: "If you see someone go in one room, go to another room because everyone is doing the same thing anyway."

_Meritocracy in games: There is this interesting idea that everyone has an equal right to success. How well you do in the game is equal to what you do with the opportunity that you are given._

MadamSin thinks that in the game, she doesn't have to worry about how he looks because he is short and small (and nothing like a leader in real life). In real life, she is an illegal immigrant working as a welder. In the game space, she isn't judged by her looks. (Implied lookism, racism, wealthism.) Everyone has the opportunity to do whatever. Whereas in the outside world, not everyone has the same opportunity.

# 4.1: Welcome to Week Four

Nodes: Half people half games. People: 0-30, games: 2-45. People have different idiosyncratic stuff. Game nodes are more frequent than people nodes. The node that organizes the network is split between people, games, and games+people.

# 4.2-4.3: The Curse of Cognitive Specificity/Vision

Shawn Green's research focuses on how to teach people to perform perceptual and cognitive tasks better. This is good for people who have impaired vision, or for people who are in jobs that need visual skills.

Humans are really greate learners in visual tasks. Subjects only get better at exactly what you train them on though. If you're good at comparing vertical lines, you aren't necessarily that good at comparing horizontal lines.

Chess experts remember chess positions 14-16 times better than the normal person, but only if the position is an actual chess position. If the pieces are random, then chess experts are no better than normal people in memory retention. This is bad when you want to train surgeons or air force pilots.

Action video games (FPS, car racing) have fast motions, many transient events, have a high perceptual load, and a huge amount of peripheral processing (keeping track of things not in the immediate field of vision).

Methodology: Since they want to make sure that the act of gaming increases their skill level, their control group is people who play Sims for 8 hours/week, and their experimental group is people who play action games inthe same time. Playing these games DO improve skill levels in terms of vision and cognitive abilities.

Action games __improve low level vision__ (ex: comparing 2 pixels and their greyness). This can have applications both for the military and for people who have lazy eyes/poor vision.

They also __improve visual acuity (2 lines (!) on an eye chart) and visual attention__. This can help when you are driving (because most of the time, accidents happen when something just appears, or at an intersection with a lot of visual noise).

# 4.4-4.6: Multitasking/Speed of Processing/Summary

It takes 250ms longer to figure out alternating color changes-shape changes than for just color changes or just shape changes. Since we commonly multitask almost always, this 250ms adds up a ton in a day to day basis.

People who train on action video games reduce switch costs by half. Prospective surgeons trained on action games are better at simulators rather than those trained on chess games. Action game expertise is actually more predictive of skill levels rather than the number of surgeries or duration of previous training.

Action video games increase reaction times (12%) without a cost inaccuracy. This is relevant to aging, in fact it is opposite to aging where reaction times slow down. 7-10 year olds who play action games can have the same type of visual capabilities as adults who don't play action video games. (This could help dyslexic children, too.)

Training on action video games increase reading speed. They are able to improve information available and these make it easier for kids to learn reading.

So what are the underlying mechanisms that promote these improvements? People who play action video games suppress visual noise better, given the same amount of signal.

# 5.1: Welcome to Week Five

What does it mean to learn history through Civilization (or board games) vs. learning through a book?

Ex Results: People who play action games do track multiple things more accurately than the rest.

# 5.2: Literacy: Constellation of Literary Practices

There is this perception that games make us violent (when violence is going down over ), that there is a social divide between readers and non-readers, and electronic media is torpid.

"Interactive electronic media, such as video games and the Internet, foster shorter attention spans and accelerated gratification."

Since video games are "replacing the activities in the lives of young people", why not see what people are actually doing while playing games?

Games themselves require reading and writing!

"afk g2g too ef ot regen no poms" => "Just a second, I need to go to the eleven forest because I don't have mana potions."

Acknowledges the intact activity structure -> coordinates the other participants who remain -> displays to community that he is a "veteran" (poms is short for potions of mana which was in the beta version, it was changed to mana potions, the speaker displays that he is a beta veteran).

This sentence shows shared values & practices (the language), shared activities, and displaying identity.

Literary Shit

- Official Discussion Boards
- Fan Fiction
- Unofficial Fandom (Fan-created material, these are usually treated with respect)

# 5.3/5.4/5.5: Fan Fiction & Why Kids Write/Nature and Quality of Game-Rased Texts/Game Reading vs. School Reading

The writing of OrientKinght (high school kid) was so good that it was selected to be put on the official web site. Before it was released, he circulated the fiction around with the guild leaders (so the leaders would think they were cool).

MMOG literacy practices meet/exceed national reading, writing, & technology standards. The kids that write the stories, it's part of playing the game for them. Games are reorganizing, not replacing, the gaming for the kids.

Text resources used by gamers: Information (46%, culled from the game API itself + user discussion, average reading level is for 12th-grade, higher than some magazines, 4% academic words), discussion forums, group organization, mods, fan fiction.

MMOs: max is 18% female. "Games are the contemporary equivalent of traditional boys' play spaces" and yet only 65% graduate high school. Boys read about 2 grades below grade level.

They found out that the boys had a decent literary level when reading game texts, so what was the difference? When we control for difficulty of text, there was no difference between their reading style for game-based and school-based.

When participants chose topic, participants' abilities were up to 8 grades above their level (they were reading texts that were 4 grades above their own level). And supposedly struggling readers were also able to perform nearly as good as normal readers.

Why? It wasn't because they had prior knowledge about the topic itself. It was because the kids were correcting themselves (self-correction) when they were reading something that they liked.

Bottom line, interest is part of performance, and we have to shift from games as means for accomplishing my (teacher's) educational goals to education as means to accomplish their (kids') goals.

# 5.6/5.7: Social Studies/ Historical Problem Spaces

SS has the longest tradition of research!

Civilization is a brilliant game for this. Instead of having everyone memorize different names and maps, how about simulating things: ancient Mesopotamia and America, Iron Age Asia, Industrial Age Europe.

Making Civ a multiplayer game transforms the lab into a place where the students asked about "what is monarchy", "what does the great wall do". They began to understand simulation ("trade monarchy to help your economy", "be worried about Egypt attacking for your horses")

Roles of mentors: general apprenticeship model.

Developing expertise: A kid hates history, then played as Scandinavia, and then they learn about how the ancient Vikings really lived. They did a mod contest, and the winner was a guy who wanted to model the Iraq war.

Newbies -> Basic Knowledge -> Systemic Expertise -> Desire to mod -> Scenario Design -> Community Leadership.

40 hours to get to expert, 40 hours to get to the end.

When video games are based on historical themes, then you can figure out what the past was like. And you can figure out how people solved problems in the past. Simulation games are good when thinking about how to solve problem spaces. The power of historical simulation is that you get to make decisions about different spaces. Too many times do we think of the past as "it happened", but you can study about real peoples with real lives and made real choices, given their resources. And we get to discover that people just want to solve problems with the best tools that they have.

# 5.8: Scientific Reasoning

Camping a boss: people began reasoning the correct team composition to take a boss monster down. They created Excel spreadsheets and formed mathematical models to support their arguments.

What part of forums have scientific habits of mind?

- _Scientific discursive practices:_ Social knowledge construction, build on others' ideas, use counterarguments, use data/evidence, explain data in an alternate way
- _Model based reasoning:_ An attempt to reverse-engineer the code built in the game. Systems based reasoning, understanding feedbak, model based reasoning, model testing and prediction, mathematical modeling, mathematical computation.
- _Tacit epistemology_: Trying to understand things in terms of science. Absolutist, relativist, evaluative.

Is this talk productive? Yes (86% of the forums was focused on social knowledge construction and problem solving).

Do they use scientific discourse? 37% build on others' ideas, 27% offer counter-arguments.

Do they use data? Yes, 28% was making claims based on evidence.

Are they using model-based reasoning? Yes. 58% was understanding the system, 41% for understanding feedback, 11% was focused on understanding the model. The models focus on testing and prediction (5%). 4% mathematical modeling, 1% mathematical computation as a form of proof.

Epistemology: 65% evaluative ("I see your point here, but..."), 30% absolutist, 5% relative.

Compare this to 1991 study about Americans: 15% evaluative, 50% absolutist, 35% relativists.

When science lessons are actually implemented, kids believe that there is just one right answer, and that's what the teacher has. This is not what science is!

It turns out that the online communities discuss games scientifically. So when you create a game, you want to make them have some component that encourage the players to engage in forums.

# 5.9/5.10: Computational Literacy/Information Literacy

A lot of people playing/modding Minecraft end up learning programming JavaScript. To even set up a server needs some computational data. Taking this into the classroom makes you facilitate things more.

Board games, especially cooperative ones make people come together and compute strategies. Modding the game dynamics also cause people to change how they think.

Information Literacy: You start by seeking information, evaluating, interpreting, synthesizing, and disseminating it. Because gaming communities are interested, they produce a ton of information: videos, fan fiction, online walkthroughs.

As you get closer and closer to expert, you get to have more complicated information seeking pattern.

# Readings 5.1: Videogames and Learning

2010: Consumer spending on games = $25.1B, surpassing music ($15B) and box oiffice movies ($10.5B).

Majority of sales = children. E = 56%, E10+ 18%, Teen 21%.

Video games are engaging: their interactivity and design principles are at the of their appeal.

Games afford opportunities for learning assessment that are rich: learning analytics, ethnographies of gamers.

Existing online distribution channels and popularity demonstrate they can scale up to entire schools and school districts.

## Current Challenges and Trends

Situational and contextual factor: videogames need to be implemented with good teachers. Game-related learning takes place not only within the videogame technology itself but also and perhaps more crucially through the activities and materials engaged in outside, but in relation to the videogame.

Overly narrow focus on the videogame technology itself may be a poor way to conceptualize how learning is enhanced.

# Readings 5.2: Gaming in the Classroom

## Why bring electronic games into the classroom?

- It's user-friendly educational technology (increases engagement, helps to personalize instruction).
- Kids love games.
- They are familiar tools for kids (they know how to learn through new media).

__Computer games simulate the brain to produce dopamine. Dopamine helps orient attention and encourage the creation of connections between neurons. These connections are the physical basis for learning.__

## Why do games motivate kids?

- Students are active when they manipulate objects and variables.
- Students have control over their actions.
- Students are engaged in experiential learning.

# Readings 5.3: How Video Games are Changing Education

## Skills Video Games Develop

- Problem Solving Skills & Negotiation
- Judgment, Analysis, & Strategic Thinking
- Communication Skills & Networking
- Narrative Skills & Transmedia Navigation
- Non-linear Thinking Patterns
- Improved Attention, Vision and Cognition

# 6.1: Week Six

For n=134, 6% academic words (we don't want it too high because it causes too many unknown words), Fry reading level = grade 10.

# 6.2: Technology Inside vs. Outside of Classrooms

The tech that most kids learn about the world flourish outside of schools and are banned in school. How do we connect their technologies?

Cheryl is a good student who knows the different technologies (Wikipedia, Facebook learning group, Khan Academy) and she uses it to amplify learning in the classroom. She is able to use digital media to give her power over the class.

John uses the same technology (music, MMORPG) to compete with the classroom.

### Digital divide is about technology practice, not technology access.

Cheryl learns how to use technology from people around her. Cheryl lives with people who have information technology jobs who use IT to solve problems. John is surrounded by people who use IT for entertainment. When schools take no stand on the appropriate use of technologies, they recreate the social divide that results from the differences in the way our classes use IT in the workplace.

# 6.3: Interest Driven Learning

Games are very well-designed for learning and for capturing interest. Games are an easy context to look at what it means to see when kids are engaged in the subject matter.

She wants to create a bridging third place between school and games. Structured stuff, it's not going to work. What they did was resourcing: she just played next to them and encouraged them to read graphic novels. It worked! When kids care about the text, they correct themselves.

Rather than treat kids' interests as a means toward your education goals, treat your educational materials as a means towards yheir goals. Teaching would look more like community organizing: what would you as the community want to accomplish?

# 6.4: Games as Gateway Drugs

Games can be a gateway to more complex problems. In WoW, the economics of buying and selling can teach kids real-life macroeconomics and business ethics.

The more you let them play, the more you break down the experience and look for learning experiences. Ex: Playing Assassins' Creed makes you an expert in Florence lol. Games connect and enhance real-life experience.

# 6.5: Learning as Cheating the Game

Students are actively asked to figure out ways to cheat. Cheats are: reading strategies, preparing for common questions, focusing on things that might be in the finals. When the kids are creating a cheat, they have to think of how the game was made, and figuring out what's the best way of beating it.

Even if you attempt to cheat, you have to understand something about percentages, fractions, etc. Kids understand and know why it is useful for them to increase their social status/salary by knowing this stuff. They want to know about percentages.

We find that we create a lot of value when kids make more connections between stuff they knew in everyday life and the new environments where they are encouraged to explore and try new identities.

# 6.6: Transformational Play

We want to reconnect people with content and context. The way that we want to present content has to be related with the context of how it is presented, and games allow it. When I preload the world, I can get feedback. What's powerful about games is that even in the classroom, a ten year old can become an enviromental scientist or a doctor, and many times the ways to do this are more rewarding and accomodating than what the real world would allow.

In this game, we have a river dying, and a ranger needs help. Immediately, the student is put into a role. The game designer is trying to pass over an intention to the player, which the player will adopt. The player will want to solve the problem once he sees the significance of the problem. The rest of the gameplay is about realizing this role.

Learners are protagonists in a new world, and there are consequences. And if the learners fail, they can just try again.

__We want to change what success means. In school we get a naked view of the concept, but we lose its meaning. We have to develop a set of understanding of what it, the concept is. And games give us a set of tools which we use to solve these problems.__

# 6.7/6.8: Games for Assessment

Problem: There is a big gap between the time of assessment and the time of learning. We don't know if the kids are understanding the content, or how to take the test.

When you play a game, the performance of the task is the assessment. If you do the activity well, then you've done the activity well. The emphasis on performance based assessment means that we could use games as the next generation of tests.

Playing video games for 1-2 hours per day were actually correlated with higher grades.

# Readings 6.1: Do Educational Video Games Actually Work?

## Benefits

- 91% of school-aged children are familiar with video games.
- The more comfortable a child is with technology, the better equipped he or she will be to stay on top of it.
- Games break down tasks, allow learners to control their navigation, and can adapt to the pace of the learner.
- Games improve visual-spatial skills.
- Some video games encourage kids to be helpful and friendly.
- 70% of teachers say that games increases student engagement.
- 60% of teachers say games help personalize instruction.

## Concerns

- They may forget the skills learned in the game when they're tested later.
- Violence in video games can contribute to social behavior problems: peopel feel more hosetile after playing in simulated real-life, violence situations.
- Some teachers and schools believe that other classoom necessities like books should be prioritized before wants like video games.
- Some parents don't want their kids playing games at school if they play it at home already.
- It's hard for a teacher to monitor every student and make sure each on is on a gaming level
