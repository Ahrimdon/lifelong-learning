## 1—TED Stanford: A Crash Course in Creativity

- Self: Knowledge, imagination, attitude
- Outside world: Culture, habitat, resources

####Imagination
- For some reason imagination is not taught to us. They ask us what 5+5 is, but they don't ask us what ?+?=10 is.
- Reframing the problem. The question you ask is the framework by which we base our answers on. We find things funny because jokes reframe things in the middle.
- Connecting and combining. Chindogu Japanese inventions—they may not be useful but they are also not useless.
- Challenge assumptions. We usually find the first right answer.  Ex: making stuff from trash.

#### Knowledge
- Before we can bring ideas to life, we need a depth of knowledge. This not only comes from books but this also comes from paying more attention.
- Ex: students went on a "Stanford Safari" and were able to learn new things from different perspectives that they didn't know before.

#### Attitude
- You need the drive and motivation. Most people imagine themselves as puzzle builders who want to solve this puzzle.
- Creative people are quiltmakers. They leverage every resource to find something creative.
Creative people need to be in environments that foster creativity.

#### Habitats
- It's not just the people but it's also the physical space. Kindergarten is colorful but the space that we are in tell a story about our lives.
- Imagination can be helped by a good habitat.

####Resources
- Unfortunately we think only of money. We have to look at the natural resources and the cultures that we built.
- The more we know, the more resources we have/can have.

#### Culture
- The background music of any community. Different music gives different moods.
- Culture is the collective attitudes of a community.

## 2—The Power of Paying Attention
- People who identify themselves as lucky see things that are beyond what you're supposed to see. 
- Focused observation and commitment to really seeing what's happening is an important key to innovation.
- Ideo interviewed people asking them why they were giving blood. They were asked to tell their reasons why they gave blood.

#### Reading—Excerpt from Ingenius Chapter 4
- The more data you collect, the more patterns you see, and the more boldly you can act.
- Steve Blank (entrepreneur) found that the registration cards of customers can be used to improve the graphics cards of a company called SuperMac.
- He called the people about the flaws of the graphics board and they were able to fix things re: product positioning and pricing. The companies market share increased from 10 to 70 percent.
- David Friedberg found that a lot of businesses are influenced by the weather. He left Google and started a company that sells insurance to protect businesses from weather-related losses.

## 2—Tom Kelley, IDEO

#### Innovation Made Personal
- Young people have so much and so many opportunities in front of us.
- Harness your potentials for innovation, remember that "every child is an artist, the problem is how to remain an artist when you grow up (Picasso)".
- Gordon Mackenzie was prepared to teach each art class individually (kindergarden then first-grade then second-grade then third....), the kindergarden kids all raised their hand and when they were becoming older they didn't identify themselves as artists.
- People were apprehensive of being judged by the other kids.
- It's okay to be an artist, an innovator, a design thinker, even if it causes other people to raise their eyebrows.

#### Thinking Like a Traveler
- IDEO, fostering lifelong creativity depends on instituting good, healthy mental habits. Be hyper-aware of your environment, and notice the common and everyday with new eyes.
- Think like a traveler, when you go to a distant city, there's a piece of your brain that is hyper-aware and you notice everything different. The bills are different, the shoes are different, the clothes are different and when you are travelling, there is a part of your brain that turns on. Turn on that part when you are tinking about stuff.
- When you graduate you will see people who have ten times your experience and they'll try to impose their ideas on you. You have to think about your ideas and use them.
"The real act of discovery consists not of seeing new lands but seeing with new eyes."

#### Field Observations with Fresh Eyes
- They want to go out there and check out how to improve kids' toothbrushes.
- Every kid's toothbrush has a logical assumption where parents have big hands, kids have little hands, so make the parent's brush smaller.
- Wrong because kids hold the brush differently, they fisted it. What IDEO did was to have fat toothbrushes for kids, and it worked, their client sold the most toothbrushes for 18 months.

#### Treat Life as an Experiment
- Not everything is successful, by the definition of experiment.
- Instead of thinking of reading a 300 page book, think that you read it 10 pages at a time, and eventually you'll finish it.
- WD-40: "Water Displacement 40 because the first 39 formulas didn't work".
- James Dyson: 5128 failed prototypes for the vacuum cleaner.

#### Cultivating an Attitude of Wisdom
- Have a healthy balance of knowing something and distrusting enough of what you know to improve more.
- Don't think "I know enough, I don't need to learn more". Caesar was killed, right.
- It's not what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that ain't so. (Mark Twain)
- In 2001, Best Buy saw this company MusicLand, and they were upstaged by Napster. They thought they knew about the market. BestBuy lost a billion dollars because they were overconfident of their knowledge in the market.
- BB's own employees itself knew that Napster was better.

#### Using your whole brain.
- Alternate applying your left and right brains.
- Use your "tortoise mind", this is something that works at the back of their minds.
- Growing ideas take time, we can't accelerate the process of stuff.
- The science of epiphany: there is no aha moment, you've just been thinking about a problem for weeks, months, or years.
- You need to take some time to daydream.

#### Do what you love. You'll be better at it.
- You'll put in the extra effort to be better at the thing you love.
- Ask yourself "what are you good at"? The problem with the answer is that you think that you should only do the thing that you are good at.
- Ask yourself "what are you born to do"? When are you in a state of flow? There were people who were happiest when they were solving equations.
- Ask yourself, "what would people pay you to do"?
- Ask yourself, "who are you going to work with"? If you work with haters, you'll hate your work.
- Think of the intersection of the four of these areas and you'll know what you want to do.
- The hardest thing to solve is the "what were you born to do" because it's easy to find things you are competent at and things that can be paid.
- He wrote down "when was I at a state of flow"? He found that he was happiest when he was teaching and when he was doing systems. That's why he taught systems.

## 3—Framing and Reframing Problems
_If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended upon the solution, I would spend the first fifty-five minutes determining how to frame the problem. For once I know the proper question to ask I can solve the problem in less than 5 minutes.  – Albert Einstein_

- The frames we create affect what we see and how we think. There are different ways to change the framing etc.
- Ask yourself, "why are you doing this"? Reframing is very important.
- Tokyo experiment where they can QR code the thing and order online then they will have the delivery when they get home.

#### TED Derek Sivers: Weird, or just different?
- In Japan, they don't have street names, they have block names. The numbers of the house are numbered according to the order they were built.
- They also have doctors who are paid when you are healthy, not when you are sick.
- In  WAfrica, the beat ends with "1".
- When something is true, assume that someone also believes the opposite to be true.
Powers of Ten (1977)
- Every ten seconds they zoomed 10x meters wider.
- Rhythm of activity and non-activity.
 
#### Creative Teams
- We usually aren't able to work for a team until we enter the workforce.
- Six thinking hats
- White—Logical
- Green—Creative
- Red—Intuitive
- Blue—Organized
- Black—Cautious/Devil's Advocate
- Yellow—Optimistic
- Individuals have a tendency to wear different hats depending on their fields.

#### Mechanics
- Star person
- Easy to practice doodling, doodle whenever you want
- Mechanically better to draw parallel and orthogonal lines
- Try star people instead of stick people
- The Sketchnote Handbook
- Visual Mettings
- The back ofthe napkin

## 4—Connect and Combine

- Everyone builds on the foundations of others.
- "Good artists copy, great artists steal."
- Regional Advantage Angela Saxenian: Silicon Valley is robust because of the cross-pollination of ideas between individuals and companies.
- Not that much of culture clash.
- Innovation almost always requires social interaction.
- Ex: Bangladesh people had a higher heart disease chance because of the lowering elevation of the land.

## 4—Humans: Why They Triumphed

- Collective Intelligence: What determines the inventiveness and rate of cultural change of a population is the amount of interaction between individuals.
- Neanderthals have brains bigger than us, but they hardly invented new foods and farms.
- It is possible to be intelligent and imaginative (Neanderthals buried thier dead) yet not experience cultural and economic progress.
- The sophistication of the modern world depends on the collctive enterprise.
- Once human progress started, it was no longer limited by the size of human brains. Intelligence became collective and cumulative.
- Trade and urbanization are the grand stimuli to invention, far more important than governments, money or individual genius. 
- The rate of cultural and economic progress depends on the rate at which ideas are having sex.
- Once human beings started swapping things and thoughts, they stumbled upon divisions of labor, in which specialization led to mutually beneficial collective knowledge.
- Australia's dry and erratic climate never allowed hunter-gatherers to reach high enough densities of interaction to indulge in more than a little specialization.
- Where population falls or is fragmented, cultural evolution may actually regress.

## 4.1—Question Assumptions
- When you ask people to line up by birthday, at first they would be hesitant, but after someone raised their hand to show their month, everyone followed suit.
- Little do they know that they could have used any other possible way such as using the floor as a timeline, writing their bdays, getting a director to organize them, etc.
- Most people run the trap with sticking to their first solution.
Brainstorming
- Always better to put people together but brainstorming guidelines are not that intuitive.
Knowing the rules isn't difficult, learning how to use them effectively is.
- You can think of the worst ideas and throw it to another team.
Setting the stage
- Who is in the room? You want to get different points of view represented.
- How is the problem framed?
- What space are you using? Create a space that fosters idea generation.
- Brainstorm standing up! It increases the energy of the group
Guidelines
- Everyone contributes: Everyone has a pen and sticky notes
- Everyone builds on the ideas of others

## 5.1—Attitude: Mastering a Creative Mindset
- "9 strikeouts for 1 grand slam"
- If you aren't throwing away a large percentage of your ideas, you aren't exploring enough of your options.
- "Failure is my constant companion, success is an occassional visitor."
- Two distinct mindsets
- People driven by a strong fear of failure
- People driven by a strong fear of missing an opportunity
- Take small chances first to build confidence.
Whether you think you can or you can't, you're right.
–Henry Ford
