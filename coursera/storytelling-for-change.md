> Great stories happen to those who can tell them. - Ira Glass, US writer and storyteller

#### Example Storytelling by Jacqueline Novogratz

> I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old. My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least I thought it was beautiful. And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy. And I wore it whenever I could, thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.

> Until one day in ninth grade, when I was standing with a number of the football players. And my body had clearly changed, and Matt Mussolina, who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz. (Laughter) And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater. We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously, my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again.

> Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid. I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes, when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old -- running toward me, wearing my sweater. And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible. But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater.

> I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth. We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know. I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be. That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia, and moved its way into the larger industry, which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia. Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing. And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry. Not to say that it shouldn't have, but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses.

#### Why Storytelling is Important

> Stories are how we think. They are how we make meaning of life. Call them schemas, scripts, cognitive maps, mental models, metaphors, or narratives. Stories are how we explain how things work, how we make decisions, how we persuade others, how we understand our place in the world, create identities, and define and teach social values.” - Dr. Pamela Rutledge

For over 27,000 years, since the first cave painting were discovered, telling stories has been one of our most fundamental communication methods and researchers have said that our brains are hard-wired to listen to and tell stories. Moreover, storytelling is a skill that transcends language, culture and geographical boundaries. It is universal and relevant in almost every communication situation.

#### Stories, Important to You and Your Change Initiatives

Personal stories allow you to share something of yourself with others and in so doing you:

- Create a connection with your listeners by showing you have things in common
- Give others an insight into who you are and your personal experiences
- Demonstrate your vulnerability (“chinks in your armor”) that make you more “human” – it’s difficult to form a relationship with a perfect person!
- Capture the essence of your message in a way that is personal to you and more easily understood by your audience

#### What Sorts of Stories Can You Tell?

- Tell Who I Am: Stories about moments that made you who you are or that clarified your values.
- Tell Who We Are: Stories about values of your organization or community, i.e. what makes up the DNA of your organization or community?
- Teach a Lesson: Stories that show how you learned something through failure or success, how you mastered a social or work skill, or how you overcame resistance to change
- Motivate Change: Stories that shed light on what’s wrong with the present situation, i.e. share dangerous mistakes from the past, establish the case for change, create a vision for the future
- Change the Frame: Stories that allow your audience to see a problem through a different lens or from a different perspective, that help to diffuse or change the emotional climate of a situation

#### REVIEWING YOUR PRESENTATION

• Identify a presentation you need to make in the near future (ideally in the next 1.-6 weeks)
•W  ho would be the audience? It could be an audience of one of of many people. Why would they be listening to you and what would they want to hear?
• What is the key message of your presentation that you could support with a personal story?
• What is the outcome you would like to achieve as a result of this presentation? What would your audience think, feel or do differently as a result of your presentation?”
