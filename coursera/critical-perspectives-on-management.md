## 0: Before We Begin

The first two weeks are drawn from the same reading. We're going to go back 2000 years ago and look at how the Romans managed to bring grain to the city of Rome which was a, a very large city.

The first week we're actually going to use that that topic to discuss the very fundamentals of what a market is and what a firm is in the context of a, of a market.

Why does the Roman green trade matter to us. It probably surprised you to see that the Romans had this kind of tax credit policy in order to encourage certain kinds of of trade. So if you predicted that a market that doesn't have information cannot actually bring green to Rome.

What's the precondition for capitalization, knowing something about the returns your capital is going to generate. That question was relevant 2,000 years ago. That question is still relevant today.

And we're going to be looking at the mechanism that firms use called the force distribution ranking scheme. We're going to be evaluating it to see what kinds of outcomes it generates for firms informed by actually the Roman case that we have still before us.

Since the 1930s, the average life expectancy of a firm has fallen by more than half. So there seems to be any number of reasons why, perhaps you might end up with sub-optimal outcomes as a result of a scheme like this.

It's a critical question for our general capitalist economy. And it's a critical question we will be considering over the rest of this class, indeed.

True wisdom consists of knowing you're not wise. The true knowledge is knowing that you do not know. And the point about that is then, there's never a point where you stop asking questions. There's never a point where you stop interrogating the world around you. You should never be satisfied with the answers at hand, must always be maintaining a kind of critical perspective on things.

You can imagine a lifetime spent going around annoying people by questioning everything you know is not perhaps the way to win friends and influence people, but as a methodology I think it's fundamental and critical. Certainly it is the methodology, the methodological impulse that informs our class.

## Reading on the Roman Grain Train

#### INTRODUCTION

- Rome is 1M by 1st century CE. It was the largest city ever until London surpassed it in the 19th century. The Colosseum seats 50K. 10K people bathe daily in the bathhouses.
- The average Roman needed a daily requirement of around 3K calories a day, or 3B calories daily. 629 tons/wheat/day, 412 tons/wine/day, 119 tons/olive oil/day, 117 tons/honey/day.
- Transporting shit via land was very expensive, and the only economical way to transport goods in quantity over any longer distance is by boat. This is why all large cities in the pre-modern world are port cities.
- Even though that was the case, no other European city can grow beyond 100K residents. Rome was able to do it becase of the political, military, economic, and social conditions that were created as the Roman Empire started to expand aggressively.
- The containers, _amphorae_, were often marked with information about the goods being transported.
- Each province developed specialized production: Baetica (modern Andalusia) and Tunisia specialized in olive oil, Greece/Italy/Spain/France specialized in wine, Egypt/Africa specialized in wheat. Wheat was usually 80% of the caloric intake of an average Roman.

#### THE GRAIN TRADE TO THE CITY OF ROME

- To provide healthy yields, wheat requires both suitable soil and sufficient rainfall. So nothing on Italy and anywhere else asides from NAfrica and the Nile delta.
- Wheat requires a minimum rainfall of 400 mm. Less and the entire crop would fail.
- Wheat is heavy and bulky to move about. Merchants who shipped grain had to ensure that their ships were sufficiently strong to withstand wheat pressure.
- Wheat "breathes" after it is harvested. Unless it is kept cool and dry it fosters conditions for mold/fungi to develop, causing the grain to rot.
- It is actually cheaper to send a shipload of grain the entire length of the Mediterranean than to cart it overland over 100km.
- It is important to maintain controls by carefully counting the sacks delivered, measuring the amounts and determinng the quality.
- We have specialized workers (counters, measurers) and supervisors to manage the process.
- There was a physical infrastructure that was devoted to the storage and delivery of grain.
- What needed to exist?  A system, with farmers, dockworkers, sailors, ship-owners, merchants, and financiers. Engineering for the ships, ports, and roads. Lawyers to draw up contracts. Judges to adjudicate during moments of dispute. A monetary system to allow long distance trade to flourish. A bureaucracy to ensure the stability of supply. A highly complex supply chain.

#### ROMAN TRADE

- Roman empire drew upon the surplus resources from the territories it conquered. Taxes were paid in cash.
- They shifted from taxation to monetary payments, which spawned the dev't of markets, increasing division of labor and growth in the Roman world.
- Land grants were given to the Roman citizens. These financed the trade that brought goods from the periphery to the center.
- While the overall pattern of trade weighted in the direction of Rome, the peripheral regions (Britain, Libya, Syria) expanded a few centuries later.

#### THE HARVESTING OF GRAIN

- Under Roman rule, Egypt was largely peaceful and prosperous. Egypt was the breadbasket of the Roman world. 
- Although Egypt is very dry, predictable seasonal variations in river height meant that farmers on the banks of the Nile could easily irrigate their crops using a technique known as basin irrigation.

#### FINANCING AND ORGANISING THE GRAIN TRADE

- There was a network of private merchants who found a profitable business importing tons of grains into Rome.
- These came from those who had disposable wealth: a small, powerful elite divided into several social classes.
- Some came from the Knights, originally wealthy families that could afford to provide cavalry for the Roman army.
- Freedmen were the glue of the Roman economy. These were former slaves, freed either by hard work, or else because they were freed by their owner. Many of Rome's most successful merchants were from slave families who, upon gaining their freedom, turned to trade.
- The operations (_societas_) were like modern corporations. Partners provided the capital, and the companies existed legally, signed contracts, maintained accounts, and paid dividends.- Companies owned or subcontracted ships, they had accountants, they employed (directly or indirectly) workers at both ends of the supply chain, and they may had a physical infrastructure. The ships were designed and optimized to carry grain.
- There were also government decrees, which lay out various financial incentives for ship-owners to build their ships to carry grain for Rome.
- The Roman grain corporations also employed a network of agents: local buyers, logistical staff, and overseers.
- Finally, individual grain merchants banded together to form what looks much like a modern-day trade association.
- We can presume that much of the structural and organizational (or cross-organisational) behaviour of the grain merchants was driven by one central concern that we might think no longer has much relevance: the problem of information.

#### INFORMATIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND THE ROMAN MARKET

- No modern communications tech then. Ther was a courier service (_cursus publicus_) that was established, but it was expensive, confined to state use, and was limited to the speed of a horse travelling over the Roman road system.
- Market information existed exclusively in a local context.
- Roman firms had a hierarchical structure to manage operations. The problem though, was the principal agent problem (how do you get agents to act in the interest of the principal as opposed to themselves). Coordinating the buying and selling was hard because of the time/distance problems.
- Key points:

	- Contracts. Binding legal documents.
	- Quality control, weights, measures meant there awas verification throughout the points of the supply chain.
	- Grain merchants had some sort of insurance from the state.
	- There was a paper trail (receipts) throughout the process.

> Given to Didymus by Posidonius, master of eight boats carrying 40,000 artabae20 in the Neaspoleos administration, I have received and had measured out to me the amount ordered by you, in accordance with the order of his excellency the procurator Neaspoleos, from public granaries of the said village at the river Tomis (a specified amount of) wheat, produce of the year (specified), unadulterated, with no admixture of earth or barley, untrodden and sifted, which I will carry to Alexandria and deliver to the officials of the administration safely, free of all risk, and damage by ship. This receipt is valid, there being three copies of it, of which I have issued two to you.21

- How about internal information within the firm? Trust and the freedmen loyalty to the family who they got freedom from. The owner-slave relationship was critical to the best interests of the stakeholder given the available information. The Romans' reputation was used to guard against moral hazard.

#### THE ROLE OF THE STATE

- The state had two focal points that determined its interest and involvement in the grain trade: the army and the metropolis of Rome.
- Three interventions: investment, incentivisation, and distribution.

	- Rome's main port, as Ostia, was rebuilt to accommodate more ships and to increase the dockside storage capacity.
	- Through various decrees, the gov't promoted the construction of larger ships, by granting special tax privileges.
	- The state also recognized the status of grain merchants, who, as I noted above, protected their collective interest by banding together into _collegia_, or associations.
	- By promoting the construction of larger ships, the state also played a role in deferring the upfront capital costs that were needed in order to respond to the city’s and the army’s need for growing supply.
	- Finally, the Roman government was the single largest purchaser of grain. Gov't wheat subsidized 30-40% of the city's population.By the Imperial period, there were almost 300 public bakeries in the city.

- Although it has been pointed out that the scale of private trade was larger than that paid for by the public purse and destined for state granaries, the fact that the state was by far the single biggest player means that it surely had a disproportionate effect on the market environment. State actions like subsidising larger ships, granting monopoly guarantees, providing portside facilities, and setting prices must have played a dominant role in determining the disposition of the market as a whole. Grain was too essential a commodity to be left entirely to free market forces.

#### SEVERAL REMARKS BY WAY OF A CONCLUSION

- The system collapsed in the third century (ca. 250 AD), when the food supply was disrupted and collapsed.
- Once Rome ceased to be the main consumer of available surplus, other parts of the Empire started to expand. 

## 1.1: The Roman Grain Trade: Introduction

What is it about the city of Rome being a million people that should be worth our attention? 

- Transportation. Big challenge.
- Interlinked state with corporate and business interests via policies.
- Size matters because of teh nature and the length of time that Rome was able to sustain that population. That's like half a millenium. We're looking to get to be that optimally efficient.

## 1.2: The Problem of Informaton

It's a, it's essentially a market in which there is a persistent informational uncertainty. There are informational asymmetries, that is to say that parties to transactions in this market have unequal levels of information.

And yet, the market did function, and it functioned spectacularly well, despite not having what we would think of as this enabling condition: enough information to entice capital to enter the market to get it functioning.

How did the Romans manage to generate an optimally efficient or near optimally efficient market absent what we would identify as a core enabling condition, without which we would predict the market couldn't function?

If we can give the market information, we can get that market to function, because a market that has information is a market then, that can function.

Where does the information start in this market? What's the beginning point of information in this market? It's the seed of grain that the farmer plants in the ground. Because that seed carries with it a certain amount of price information, so you know how much it costs to put in the ground and the labor and so on.

So if we start with, does it start, I should add, does it start with the population in Rome that wants bread? Based on that then you know how much bread you need to produce. Okay, so if you don't have the hungry Romans, you don't know how much bread to produce. Well Oh, no, but it's always need that triggers the production. The need that triggers production, where
is the need in our hypothetical market, where does the need start?

So actually, the problem, if we were to think, okay, the information starts with a hungry population in Rome, that actually presupposes the functioning of the market. Problem is we're not there yet, we don't have a market that functions, because we've predicted that a market that doesn't have information cannot actually bring grain to Rome.

So it starts then with the grain that goes in the ground, and the need that attaches to that, which is the need of a farmer, him or herself. And so if the farmer grows the grain and produces enough for himself or herself and adds a little extra supply, at that point, now we have surplus agriculture and it starts to move into the market.

It's already at the point where they, they are the ones who are exchanging information, so the information is the right information. Yeah they have, essentially all of the knowledge that they need, in order to eliminate for potential problems in that transaction, right?

The farmer knows how much he needs to sell the wheat for, the grain for. The person who's collecting it knows how much she is willing to pay, and so, when they come to, when they're parties to that transaction, they have good information, which means that there is transactional efficiency in that information.

And then as the grain moves off the farm into the cart, it carries with it that good information. And as if we imagine simply moving up our supply chain and we'll use the case of Egypt here because it was the one that was in, outlined in the case.

If we follow that supply chain along, at every moment where there is a transaction, so when Georgianna sells it to Antonio sells it to Amaranth and so on, every time they're engaging in a transaction, what is the nature of information in that transaction, good or bad?

Good. Why? Quantity, price, quality. You are not constrained into the transaction. (Different buyers and sellers exist at every point in the supply chain.) Because you assume the risk for your part in the chain, then you have to make sure that your good is of sufficient quality, and it is exactly what's ordered.

Because it's subject to locally competitive forces, if the farmer is asking too much for the grain, you could simply go to another farmer. And if the donkey and cart operation is asking too much, you find somebody else and so the locally competitive forces further reinforce the efficiency of the market and so you have transactional relationships which are characterized by good information in a locally competitive environment, which suggests you have a efficient market indeed, right?

Lastly, what is the problem of the Roman who buys the bread? Price. It can be too expensive because of so many intermediaries. How do you solve the problem of transaction costs?

If the problem of the market is a lack of information, isn't the best way to solve then for the information, to solve for that problem of information, simply to introduce a transactional environment where information is passed efficiently along from person to person to person. But the market can only extend out as far as those transactions costs allow, which in this case might be, who knows, somewhere on the upper Nile.

Beyond that, it's simply too expensive and there is no market. So as we've seen, when we saw for the problem of information in the market, we do so at the expense of unacceptably high transaction costs. Meaning, that the market cannot function, since the cost using the market to move to grain to Rome is simply too high.

The paradox of the market is it doesn't have enough information. We have given the market now the information that it needs, but we have done so with the expense of unacceptability high cost, which means we are now closer to solving the central dilemma: how did the Romans manage to get this market working?

## 1.3: The Problem of Transaction Costs

How did the Romans solve then for this transaction cost problem; what did they do?

Competition. Competition between merchants, and the government was also involved.

So what's the problem we need to solve for now? Drive down transaction costs by competition, through recording the same transaction? One of the ways to do it might be through competition, so you can strain the ability of individual intermediaries to, to overcharge.

So you try and optimize the price mechanism, as we call it. Would that be sufficient, though, given the number of intermediaries that we've pointed out here?

Even if we introduce optimally efficient circumstances in each one of those locally, in those local transactional environments, would that be sufficient to drive down transaction costs enough to let our hungry Roman have his morning bread?

A kind of vertical integration in a way, by creating a company. What do we call vertical integration? A company, a firm.

Why does a firm exist? answer that he came up with, now we call it the Transactional Theory of the Firm. The firm is merely an organizationally efficient response to a market transaction problem.

So, when you have a market, the cost of using it which is high, so there is a high cost of using the market, organizing operations through a firm, coordinating the activities of all those entrepreneurs under the umbrella of the firm allows you systematical to reduce the transactions costs of that market.

It is cheaper to put your donkey and cart man on salary and have him go around and collect the surplus grain, than it is to pay them individually every single time that there's a transaction, simply systematically reduces the cost.

It's a dominant theory, that at a very basic level a firm is merely than an organizational response to a transaction cost problem. And our case in Rome, I think, illustrates that very clearly, 'because that's what the Romans did.

That's why they developed essentially, a firm driven response to using the market. Entrepreneurial driven response to using the market, leads to unacceptably high transaction cost. When you move it to a firm, so that is to say, when you domesticate many of those transactions under the umbrella of a single organization, you create efficiencies. It becomes cheaper and that reduces the overall cost of using the market.

It was estimated that the additional cost of moving grain from, I believe it was Spain to Rome, so that is to say, all of the attendant costs in of, of the supply chain, added only 16% to the cost of the product. Which, if we think about the time period, is a pretty remarkable achievement, to be able to reduce the cost of using the market to only 16% of the value of the good.

So the question then is how were the Romans able to derive a firm driven response. What was it that they had? What could they do that allowed them to use the firm as an efficient response to this market dilemma? And as we know, the problem with a firm is what? What happens, as soon as you have a firm, you may get transactional cost efficiencies, but you get it at the expense of something else. What do we call that?

Bureaucracy. Moral hazard. The divergence of interests between the people who own the company or supply the capital, and the interests of the people who are charged with going out and generating the rents that that capital is seeking. Known in the literature as the principal-agent problem. In very broad way, we might simply say that a firm is merely a principal-agent problem that has been more or less effectively solved.

But it's a very serious problem right, the principal-agent problem? Because if I give somebody a whole bunch of money and I send them out and they go a thousand kilometers away, to act on my behalf, but I have no idea what they're doing, am I likely to lend them money in the first place? Am I likely to capitalize the system in the first place? No.

What makes, what's the precondition for capitalization? Knowing something about the returns your capital is going to generate.

Rome was a city of a million people for 500 years in a persistently informationally uncertain environment. Which means that they must have had a well capitalize market, a well functioning market. How was it that they were able to resolve for the principal-agent problem of the firm, in order to generate the capital that the market needed to function?

## 1.4: Transactions and the Agency Dilemma

How was it that they were able to resolve for the principal agent problem of a firm, in order to generate the capital that the market needed to function? What did they do? They had freedmen agents.

So, we have here, in a sense, an opportunity to consider the firm at a very basic level, which I think, from the point of view is management, is fundamental. Because it's strips so many externalities from the question of the firm. And invites us to think of the firm in a very, in, in the terms of its very pure functioning.

In a modern scenario, if you wanted to see a similar kind of mechanism, let's look at employee stock options. But in the Romans, it was because of teh slavery that enabled the Romans to compensate.

Now, we have loyalty to the firm. And fear, a bit. But reputation. Social inclusion and social exclusion, if you did not respect the moral contract, you had the risk of being socially excluded, and therefore not being able to earn a living.

Stuff such as contracts or inspecting ships were quality controls. Internal mechanisms in firms are governed not by coercive stuff such as QC but by being self-governed. Reputation and trust.

Now, we have emails or weekly reports. They had receipts. Which are super sub-optmal.

Alfred Chandler, said that managerial hierarchies are what make a firm. Without it you just have entrepreneurs in shops. You can't have the firm without the telegraph and the railroad. Until the information can move at the speed of an electron, so that you can monitor people in far far-flung places, the firm is a very unlikely entity to exist.

If you don't have an ability to monitor, why would you erect a firm in the first place? It's simply too much risk for capital. There are other, better ways to generate returns for your capital than entering into a risky organizational proposition like this one.

And yet the Romans were able to do this. They were able to do so in a way that led to optimal, optimal results, optimal market efficiencies. And what did they have? They had, in addition to these other coercive, its extra-organizational institutions, they had this mechanism of reputation.

Which invites us then to focus on the mechanism of reputation, to ask us about the question of incentive since it seems to be, this is what the Roman grain trade tells us, it seems to be fundamental to how firms work.

And what it suggests is well, one of the things we need to think very carefully about is this question of reputation, trust, and incentive. What kinds of reputational, trust, and incentive mechanisms are we putting in place in our organization in order to optimize outcomes?

## 2.1: Weighing the Method

We see a market that is characterized by persistent informational uncertainty. And a market that doesn't have the information that it needs is a market that we would predict cannot function.

The problem is that when we have an entrepreneurial driven market, so in other words when we have individual intermediaries in the market, the result is unacceptably high transaction costs.

The mechanism that we use to control for transaction cost, and I suggested the Coaseian framework from 1937, elegant then, elegant now. Is that a firm, the nature of the firm is simply an organizationally efficient response to a transaction cost problem.

It's cheaper in the end, to use the market by domesting, domesticating those transaction costs, under the umbrella of a single organization. That solves for the cost problems.

Romans had a robust legal frame work, which allows them to sign contracts in triplicate. They also have QC mechanisms. But most importantly, they had a mechanism of slavery. This solved the problem of agency.

The enabling condition for the firm is that you have sufficient velocity of information to enable a hierarchical, managerial structure. That's when firms exist. Romans didn't have this.

How do we control for agency costs, how we, in a management context, talk about
agency.

Forced distribution ranking: Stack/rank, rank/yank. Evaluation periods. Promotions. Alternative career choices. Everyone, including the F 500 and the Big Four, does this. Curved evaluation scheme the forced the forced distribution ranking scheme.

Firms do this for the performance incentive. It keeps from being sued when they fire someone. It is a transparent monitoring scheme.

Because of the constant evaluation, you're always identifying talent and people who are holding you back. Because of the competitive environment, they are motivated to work a little harder.

Does that send a good signal to the cx? Yes, because  "I want to sign a contract with these guys, because they promote that kind of talent, they have that kind of excellence." 

Transparent information flows + knowing the rules of the game + promoting a kind of higher productivity and competitivity amongst your workforce +  sending positive signals to the market means it makes sent to have a curved employee evaluation scheme.

Employees hate this. But while employees feel that this is undue pressue, isn't the firm about optimizing its own outcomes and earning money? If the employees are not happy, then they will make the firm suffer at the end.

Boosting productivity, constantly promoting talent, creating informational transparency, creating informational flows, and sending positive signals to the market. That's or those all sound like pretty good things. And if a firm can achieve those things or something like the forced ranking scheme, they should do it.

## 2.2: FDRS Some Drawback

Where would we expect the primary incentive in the aggregate to be located? To seek promotion? Or to avoid being fired, to avoid termination?

Your Incentives are always going to be selfish. They're not going to be the same as the firm's incentives. Economics teaches us that we are inherently selfish beings only looking out for us, that's true.

You need to not get fired first before you get promoted. And sometimes, by being given a crappy evaluation, you can find good alternatives in life. But people usually hate change. It makes you look bad. It entails reputation risk, and reduces your market value. So the primary motivated will be not to get fired.

This makes people choose low risk decisions. It systematically and structurally disincentives the taking of risk. It diminishes collaboration, because you don't want to be part of the bottom 2, because it's a zero-sum game. You can also reduce the level of output of the company as a whole, because everyone is just working to be better than the two worst. Worst, you can enhance your own position by pushing other people down.

And when talents are clumped, it's a great opportunity to learn, but you have to compete with them. But if you're surrounded by mediocre people, you think you're probably safe this quarter.

A scheme that inherently and necessarily introduces punitive measures would discourage talent clustering. Because it would make essentially the fulfillment of that primary incentive, that primary obligation harder. And so if it makes it harder, you would avoid it. If it's harder to avoid being fired by working under a condition A or a condition B, you're going to avoid it. And that means then that we would predict systemic avoidance of talent clustering in a firm.

## 2.3: Outcomes and Contrasting Evidence

Management needs to control for agency costs within the organization. And no manager wants an environment where people in the firm don't collaborate, have a bare minimum and don't do much more, and are always pissed off.

Why do firms have this scheme (firing)? Jack Welsh (GE) said they have a scheme like that, and he said it's fundamental to our firm's success. They are looking at it from a results-driven perspective. Tons of companies do this, even though the literature hates the concept of employee appraisal.

There are no real world examples that demonstrate optimal firm outcomes using a forced ranked distribution scheme. And even though studies which based on models predict perhaps a boost of productivity in firm performance, find it that boost, of that productivity boost is limited, last maybe a year or two years.

Firms have a network effect: once one firm starts to do it, many firms do it too. But the Roman grain trade case suggests you don't need that kind of coercive monitoring mechanism. Instead you want mechanisms that foster trust and reputation amongst your employees, because that's the best way to align incentives.

If you compare firms that do employ stack and rank like Microsoft, and you put them up against companies that don't, like Google, it's not clear, I think, to any of us, that we're necessarily seeing unambiguous better performance in one than the other.

If we simply do something because it seems like a good idea without considering why it's a good idea from every possible angle, and only implementing it after we have made that consideration, we are not engaging in good management practice. That is an example of management failure. And this is what we need to avoid, this is what firms need to avoid, they need to avoid that kind of failure, and you avoid that kind of failure by coming at the questions, at the problems that you need to solve, in the widest and most informed way possible.

If you simply look at something from the top down, and you forget to consider it from other perspectives, you are unlikely to be able to project all of the potential consequences for the decisions that you're taking. And yet that is the role of a good management.

## 2.4: Concluding Lessons from the Roman Grain Market

And it's worth noting that the Rome that disappears in the third century. When Roman authority is reestablished at the end of the third century, at the beginning of the fourth century, after the reforms of Diocletian, the center of Rome, the Roman empire, is no longer in Rome, in Italy, but rather in Constantinople in what is now Turkey. And the whole system that supported the Roman Metropolis for that period of time never really gets restored.

What might explain how a complex system that's organized itself in such a way so as to be sustainable over a very long period of time. Why would it suddenly fail?

Having witnessed it with our own eyes, we know what it looks like. What is it that the system needs in order to continue functioning? What disappeared September 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed, what disappeared that didn't let the market continue?

Trust. When the market loses confidence it can no longer function.  When the Roman Empire was no longer at peace is partly true that the empire breaks up into three, there's civil war, there's strife and so. So there are these exogenous factors that seems to contribute to the erosion of confidence.

Rome had an increasd military expenditure, because its territory was so big. And Rome was under a fixed gold standard, the only money available to the Roman economy was what they could dig out of the ground in gold and silver. You have expanding military costs and fixed money supply.

First, you try to get taxes. But when you don't have revenue, we just print cash. (The Romans just diluted their gold from 100% to 5%.) So you make money out of nothing. And Roman coinage began to debase over the next 50 years. And there's a tipping point, a moment at which the market simply stops to function.

The reason why the Romans needed to debase their currency in the first place was because of constant growth and expansion. More costs which the state was not able to bear. Now growth is a major benchmark of managerial success today. Why is no or little growth a bad thing to say?  

What kinds of consequences are there for firms operating in an environment where the only benchmark for success is that model of growth? Is that sustainable? Can firms actually generate good long-term outcomes if that's the only benchmark of success that we know? Or should we instead consider offering ourselves the latitude to expand the benchmarks of success?

We see that Rome essentially moves out of an equilibrium and as a result ends up destroyed. Or at least the market ends up destroyed. If it's not good for Rome, it's not good for a firm. Firms need to be able, managers of firms need to be able to identify and then try to achieve equilibrium with their market. And that should be a benchmark of success. And we need to give ourselves that piece of vocabulary back when we think about what good management practice is.

Since the 1930s The average life expectancy of a firm has fallen by more than half. Could it be that the management principles that inform the direction of those firms are no longer serving the interests of the firm itself? And that that divergence of management principle and firm outcome has actually led to the diminution of their life expectancy.

It's a critical question for our general capitalist economy, and it's a critical question that we'll be considering over the rest of this class, indeed.

## 3.1: Innovation

Growth. Value. Competitive advantage. Survival. Companies that can't solve their problems, companies that can't grow, companies that can't retain their competitive advantage are companies that will die.

Improvement or revolutionary? Evolutionary or incremental? Disruptive, or what you know? Random, or deliberate?

Innovation is about the right environment, creating disruptive ideas, in a task-driven environment which is sensitive to the market in order to retain competitive advantage and that's three of 'em.

Or you say, no, no, it's about, randomness and creativity and simplicity, with an acceptance for risk in order to create, development.

Or you say, no, no, no, no, no. It's about, a constant sense of improvement with, giving the freedom to the people that you work with, the idea of rule breaking driven by customer need in order to drive great profits and that's Apple.


__What it tells us is a lot of what we read about innovation is in fact merely the reverse engineering of success stories in the marketplace, which is another way of saying," Do what these guys did and let's call that innovation".__

The limitations of a reverse engineered success tells us, that the concept of innovation itself remains very elusive. We know it's not invention, because it's not called invention. We know it can't just be improvement, because if it were, we would call it

## 3.2: The Box: Explaining its Introduction

Why does it make sense to internationalize, globalize management where in this, in todays world? I think the answer to that is because a global economy needs a global manager.

It's only the rise then of the global economy that we have now the need for an international manager, somebody who can speak a kind of international language of management.

How did the shipping container made the world a smaller place? Why was the, why were the 1950s and the 1960s the right time, the right place, for what is, after all, a very old idea.

The Romans had their own version of the container, the amphori. Why so long before the shipping container?

Random + environment. Random event: The person who came up with the idea. Environment: The shipping industry was in a crisis. They were also looking how to cut the costs and compete in a better way.

We could also look at the competition that existed during this period. Need good transpo system to bring US goods to market in Europe. Labor scarcity? Government intervention?

Trade was also a good diplomatic move. Build close trading relationships, from close economic relationships come strong political friendships.

I think someone from outside the industry has to make the change, because anybody within the industry couldn't, imagine, such a radical change and couldn't, and saw all the problems that could be caused by it.

McLean: Outside perspective, relentlessly focused on cost-cutting, and someone whose capacity or appetite for risk is huge.

## 3.3: The Box: Conditions for Success

He has the ability to take risk, he has the ability to solve problems, he has the ability to look at old problems in a new way.

He just needed money to create an entirely new global infrastructure from the ground up. You need new ports, new infrastructure. We can change the things we don't want (climate change) but we "don't have cash". We know it's not great but, it's good enough.

So, we accept that it's actually just better than to stick with the system that we have rather than expose our self to the tremendous expenditure to change it.

Is this a problem of cost or a problem from seeing the benefits? Politicans, because they want to get re-elected, also don't want to take risks on bond issuances.

Does it create competitive disadvantage this, this market as it existed prior to the introduction of the container. Were firms that needed to ship goods at a competitive disadvantage because of the nature of the marketplace?

It's very expensive to use the market. This creates a demand for change. Labor is expensive, high costs, and there is a chance for theft. The theft means the two firms are not at a competitive advantage to each other because they're both facing the same issues. They also factor the price of shipping the good into the price of the good itself.

If it's expensive to use the market, many goods are simply not going to travel that far and so the market has kind of natural boundaries built around the constraints of using the market itself, which may not be ideal.

There's a definition to my market and one of the constraints, is simply the cost of shipping my goods. And once it gets too expensive, I don't have a market there.

## The Box: The Story of Failure

Costs have always been there. Why not the 40s, 30s, 20s, so on? McLean's great insight was that the business of shipping was moving cargo and not sailing ships. 

Malcom McLean's great insight was that the problem of shipping was the people you needed to move the good from point a to point b. If you get rid of the people, you get rid of the problem.

He didn't really care how you did it. He thought maybe I can drive trucks directly onto ships or whatever. The point being, he was simply looking for a solution that eradicated the people because the people were the problem.

Get rid of the people, you have gotten rid of the problem. What was the problem of the people, these dock workers? If it's not cost, and they'd always introduce high cost, high theft.

What they introduced was not high cost, but far worse, unpredictability. How did they make the market unpredictable? By striking. Work stoppages.

The market in the 1950s and 60s characterized by expanding trade, increasing importance of trade, a market that was looking for more productivity and more predictability, what did it get from the dock worker unions?

Less productivity, less predictability; in other words, the unions gave the market exactly the opposite of what it needed.

And the animating principal of what was new, was let's get rid of this factor, which is provoking the unpredictability.

There's an equally interesting and perhaps a more important story of failure happening here, who failed? The dockworkers, the dockworker unions failed. They failed organizationally. They failed as an institution.

Why did they fail? Because they did not give the market what it needed. When the market was asking for more predictability and more productivity they gave the market less predictability and less productivity and moreover they did so in a local way.

## 3.5: Thinking Beyond Innovation

The unions did not innovate. When you think of innovation, do you think unions? No. The purpose of a union is to secure under the circumstances the best possible condition for its membership, right? That's the purpose of a union.

In the context of a changing environment, what's the best way to deal with that? Adapt. Why then, in the context of managerial culture, don't we have this as our concept for how firms should deal with a dynamic competitive environment?

Why don't we say firms need to learn how to adapt? Why have we substituted innovation over adaptation? Why do we tell firms, no, no, don't forget about adaptation. You need to innovate, innovate to success, innovate to value, innovate to grow, innovate to retain your competitive advantage. Why don't we say adapt?

- Not comfortable, it's not taking the next step forward, but just conforming to the change in society rather thatn being the changer.
- To innovate basically the same thing would mean that you know you are who's in control, you are who's setting these conditions.
- The current managerial culture fails to address a fundamental concern that we have driven into the idea of what good management is. Growth and doing better.
- Innovation prescribes; adaptation is agnostic and it doesn't care.


Sometimes growing is not the right answer. Sometimes looking to grow is not the right answer. Sometimes the best corporate strategy in order to tain, attain long term optimal results is the reverse. Get smaller.

Blackberry: The marketplace has moved on. Not much market left for their devices. BB should say that "we're very good at building enterprise solutions, so let's try and focus on that string." Maybe we'll lose half of our market cap, maybe we'll lose a lot of our market our market presence. But that's where our strengths now exist in this kind of a market place. That's where we should be moving.

Innovation doesn't give you that as a managerial option. Adaptation is a much more powerful tool because of its agnosticism. It doesn't try to prescribe a right answer. It simply says look at your surroundings and do what you need to do in order to optimize your position within those surroundings, and sometimes that means accepting getting smaller, accepting poor results, accepting shrinking profit margins.

It's a Darwinian environment and as the competitive forces get sharper and stronger, some firms simply deserve to succumb to those market forces. That's the purpose of a strategy, to ensure your own survival. 

Instead of innovate or die, adapt or die. Sometimes the right way to adapt, is to innovate. Undoubtedly, but it's not the only way. Some firms want drastic change, or R&D.

What you don't find or only much more rarely are firms that are capable of refashioning themselves, changing their focus to become something else.

And letting go of something even if it means profound altering their size, their profitability and other KPIs that we identified as key to the success.

And that shouldn't surprise us, because in a managerial culture where the only benchmark of success is growth.

It's a failure of management if you can't give yourself the widest range of options in order to secure optimal results for your firm. Which means, we need to change the conversation and we need to think about management in a new way.

Another example of a critical perspective on management that invites us to take the assumptions that we've held and actually challenge the basis upon which we hold them.

## Week 4 - 1 Examples of commonplace narratives (13:10)

Who do you think of, when I say the word entrepreneur? Is it referring to the Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg's, Richard Branson's of the world? Small businesses. Mom and pop shops, plumbers, electricians, contractors, right? That's what entrepreneur means, in that sense. Why is, and that's the vast majority of entrepreneurial activity, right? It's guys who are setting up their own shop as a plumber, as a contractor, as an electrician. When we talk then about entrepreneurial activity in terms of the economy. That's 99% of the people that are being referred to. 

Why is it then that when we think of the word, entrepreneur, we don't immediately think of a plumber crawling underneath our cabinets to fix our sink? But instead we think of, some guy in a cool office in Silicon Valley waiting to become a billionaire. Where does that come from? It comes from, a culturally driven narrative about what the entrepreneur is. Many of you might say. I want to be an entrepreneur. By which you do not mean, I want to be a plumber. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But I suspect most of you don't mean that. And that's because you're essentially mapping that kind of narrative defined idea of entrepreneurship onto the, onto the notion. 

Another example, when I ask you the question Who is the largest holder of US debt? China. It's unambiguous, the room always answers China. Who knows the actual answer? Who's sitting in this room right now, smug, quietly confident, thinking, I'm just better than these people? Who, who is the largest holder of US debt? The Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is the largest holder of US debt. Since 2008, the Federal Reserve They, they wrap it up in this nice language, they call it quantitative easing. What that means is you go in on Sunday and you activate the printing presses and you print up a whole bunch of money. And then on Monday, you take that money and you use it to buy up treasury bonds. So it's essentially a way for the government to print money to lend to itself at a moderate interest rate. And as a result of this particular project the Federal Reserve is now owns about a quarter of all U.S. debt. 

Who's the second largest holder of U.S. debt? China, right? Wrong! Second largest holder of U.S. debt? Social Security, The U.S. pension scheme, right? U.S. social security buys up T bills, essentially. The government collects tax dollars, collects pension dollars on, on, of U.S. citizens. Uses that to then finances its own operations through debt. 

And number three is China. Depending on the day because sometimes Japan sneaks ahead but China, Japan come in at both at about ten percent. China is the largest foreign debt holder of the United States not the largest debt holder of the United States but this idea that somehow the United States is indebted to China as opposed to itself, I think, is a commonly held view. Why? Where does that come from? Why do we all think that China is the largest U.S. debt holder? Not only is it wrong, but it's quite significantly wrong. Where does that idea come from? It's a media driven narrative, right? This is something that we hear in the media. It's been out there, it's part of the story that is told and so, as a result we acquire this general belief. China is the largest debt holder of the United States. To the point where, in fact, you can see that a political discourse can be constructed around that fallacy to gain political capital. 

Okay, so I think those are pretty straight forward ideas of narrative. So we have a kind of culture narrative. The idea of the entrepreneur divorced from reality. And put into this kind of rarefied category, the idea of fallacies about basic, basic things like who's the largest debt holder in the United States. Media driven narrative, those are pretty straight forward, I have another example of narrative. 

(Watches movie)

We got it right. Yay. Good. Well done for us. Good. Yay. Okay, so the question is, how did we know, how do we know so much about this movie? We watched about 19 seconds of it. We've essentially predicted the dynamic, the way the movie's going to move forward, the mechanism of generating the plot, and so on. Do you expect them to get married at the end, that first two, or not? It's not, are you sure? It's not going to be about how they sort of overcome travails and manage to find true love? No. Right, because when a woman is that, that kind of power dynamic indicates there's not true love here. So how do we know so much about this film? We've seen it before, right? The film is, the way it works is, it simply is throwing out cues that refer to archetypes that we're already familiar with. 

When Hollywood shows us a woman who is sensibly dressed with short Black hair, we read that as professional lawyer. When we see the long blonde haired tiki girl, we see somebody who's full of life and willing to live on the edge or break the rules and so on. And so the fact that we've seen this story before, that all of these cues from the very music that it starts with to the voice, to the tone of voice of the voiceover and so on Simply allows us, based on what we know, to fill in the gaps. And the result is that we can take a one minute and 40, one hour and 40 minute movie, and based on 19 seconds, more or less construct out the plot, to the point where, do we need to see it? No.  That I think, is a concept of narrative that's also fairly familiar to us. The idea of the universal story. Star Wars, just another version of the Arthurian Legend or whatever. The idea of these kind of larger archetypes, tropes that are out there that we're all familiar with. They are part of our common cultural currency and we have access to them. And so, we can use it in order to fill in the gaps and thereby construct, as it were, the narrative that's being referenced.

## 1 - 19 - Week 4 - 2 Towards a metacritical concept of narrative (13_08).txt

Okay. I have another example, the final example, to help us move then from this idea of narrative as a kind of story telling, and this way. To see if we can develop a more meta-conc…, a meta critical concept or conceptual approach to this idea of narrative. And my example is drawn from the gospels. So, yes, I did go from A Guy Thing to the gospels. We'll just have to live with that. So, this is taken from the so-called four canonical gospels. This is what's known as a synoptic gospel tool. This is what biblical scholars use when they do textual, critiques or textual comparative criticism of the gospel. And I want to take just a small example from this known as the seven last words of Christ. The seven last words refer to the seven utterances that Jesus makes while on the cross, taken from the four canonical gospels. Some of you I'm sure are familiar with the seven last words. It's interesting that the seven are actually the compendium. That is to say, they’re all seven taken across all four accounts. But in each gospel, he actually says different things. So what I'd like to do is to look at the different things that he says. By way of background, very quickly for those of you who may not be entirely familiar. 

What we're looking at here, so, this is the moment of crucifixion, so Jesus has come to Jerusalem, to bring his message, to Jerusalem. He goes into the temple and cleanses the temple and pisses off the, el, the Elders of the temple there. And so as result of that, they put him on trial.They convoke what is known as a Sanhedrin which is a Jewish, a Jewish court of law. A Jewish tribunal and they sentenced him to death for this, the crime of blasphemy. Ah,but because they are simply a religious group they don't have civil authority they hand him over to the Romans to carry out the death sentence, and so the Romans duly crucify him, so we're looking at here the actual carrying out of the sentence, in Jesus's death. So, just before he dies, he's has there's this tradition that he says these seven last words and what I like to do is to review what they are. 

Just so we're clear, couple of points we should note about what the text are that we're encountering these words in the gospel, the gospel simply means the good news, it is a textual mechanism for telling this particular story, means the good news. Not everybody may know, that there are not four gospels. There are many, many, many gospels. Hundreds, probably were written. I think, I don't know how many we actually know. I think more than a 100. These four are the ones that were chosen in the second and third century by tradition to represent what was then the emerging church. But there is in addition to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. There's a gospel of Thomas, a gospel of Peter, a gospel of Judas, a gospel of Mary, a gospel of Magdelene and so on, and so on, and so on. So this, these four gospels fit into this larger tradition of texts that when, were, were written to, to spread the good news. And the other thing that's worth noting is that all of them were written at least one generation after the events that they describe. Right? So they are written no earlier than about 75 AD, that's about 40 something years after the events that are being described. And in the case of John, probably two generations afterwards. Most scholars think that John was written in the first decades of the 2nd century, AD. 

Okay, with that in mind, let's take a look at our four last words. In Matthew and in Mark, we have agreements. Jesus says one thing and only one thing, he says my God, why have you betrayed me? Right? It's all he says [FOREIGN]. In Luke he says three things, first he turns to the assembled crowd of Jews that have come to watch the sentence being carried out and he says forgive them, they don't know what they're doing. Then, and some of you may know this. That Jesus was crucified between two common criminals. As a way of sort of reinforcing the degradation. So one of the criminals turns to him and sort of says, you know? What's going on? What's your plan? And he says don't worry. Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in heaven. And then finally just before he dies he says father, into thy hands, into your hands I give up my spirit ,so into thy hands I commit my spirit. So, these the three things in Luke forgive them they know not what they do, today we'll be together in heaven and I give up my spirit. 

In John he says three other things entirely first he says woman. Speaking to his mother, woman behold your son. Then he says, I'm thirsty, and then he says, it's over or, it is done. So, woman behold your son, I'm thirsty, it is over. Taken together those represent the last seven words, but clearly, we're looking at. 

Based on those sentiments, three very different people being portrayed. Are we not? What kind of a person is it who says why have you betrayed me? What kind of emotion is that? Anger. Disillusionment. Betrayal, obviously. And it's a question. Which means what? Surprise. Why have you betrayed me? It's a surprise, what, that, that this is going on. It's a question. Luke, first he forgives those who have condemned him, then despite his own great suffering turns to reassure the person who is suffering next to him, and finally says, into thy hands I commit my spirit. What kind of emotional state is that? Calm, at peace. What else? >> Acceptance. >> Acceptance. >> Generosity. >> Generosity. >> Compassion. >> Compassion. Is he surprised? >> No. >> No. Is he upset? No. Is he anguished? No. So we have somebody who seems calm, compassionate, generous, accepting. 

John. Hi mom. Water to table five, please. It's over [LAUGH] What do we make of that? Woman behold your son, I’m thirsty. It is finished. What kind of a sentiment is going on here? How would we, how bizarre. What do we make of this? [NOISE] I'm thirsty. Seems like an indifference to the import of the moment. 

So, how can we explain that in these gospel accounts we have somebody who is surprised, betrayed, angry, anguished, somebody who is compassionate, generous, accepting and somebody who is indifferent. Those are three very, very different states of mine, three very different emotional conditions. How can we explain Why our canonical Gospels represent such different characters here. 

What might be going on? What factors should we use to explain what's happening here? Yep. Interpretation of the author, okay. Audience, and why is that matter? Those audiences have different traditions of their own, so this is a different way to explain the gospel to a different audience. Where is the agency, then? Is it, is the agency in the authorship, whoever authored, we don't know who authored the text of the Gospels, they're only by tradition called these things. But whoever these authors were, is the agency with the author? Or is the agency with the audience? With the audience, right, that's how we can explain these divergences. That's exactly right. 

The interesting thing is when we first look at that, what we think is. What this actually tells us is a great deal about the audience within which these texts were written, the agency then lies there, and that's, and so we can __conclude is Matthew and Mark are what are known as, or, the, the sentiment in Matthew and Mark is what is known as philosemitic, it's a sentiment that is reasonable in the context of a community of early Jewish believers, in other words, Jews who subscribe to the Christological moment.__ And if you are, if you were Jewish, and you believe that, that Jesus represents the anointed come to fulfil, the initial covenant that your people has made with God, and that, that instrument of redemption ends up crucified, is that consistent with the God of the old testament who's constantly getting angry and smiting things? 

No, and so the correct or a reasonable expression would be surprise how is this part of the plan this seems odd it doesn't seem consistent with the way in which the promise of redemption laid out in the Old Testament would be fulfilled in the case of Luke. T__he suggestion is that this is a text written from within a community of both Jews and Gentiles. People who were, so a mixed community, in other words. And that makes sense. So that we have this message of, essentially, forgiveness and inclusion. Wrapped up nicely in the idea of The Spirit.__ 

__And that mattered a great deal, and those of you that know the Pauline epistolary will know that one of the big problems in the immediate aftermath of,of the resurrection was how do you move from what essentially Jewish observances and practices to a wider belief set, a wider set of customs to being inclusive of people who may not have been by birth Jewish.__ That mattered in practical terms because there was a law that said you could not enter into a temple if you were not circumcised. Right. because it was, you were impure. Difficult to go to a 30 year old male uncircumcised person and say, there's this great new faith out here, think you should join, check out the temple. There will be a little snipping first. 

You can have a very compelling message. But you're going to lose a lot of that compelling message at the moment that actually circumcision becomes a precondition for entering the temple, which is one of the reasons why Paul's letter to the Romans goes on and on and on and on about circumcision in the temple and the fulfilment of the law, and so on. And so this idea of inclusion was important in practical terms to bring communities that had vastly different customs together, under this one belief set. 

John, behold your mother, I am thirsty, it is finished. The sense of indifference. It's actually, perhaps, the easiest of the gospels for us to explain. Because it's very consistent with the belief set known as gnosticism, from the Greek word gnosis, meaning knowledge, gnosis. And the Gnostics, the gnostic Christian tradition emphasize the separation of the spirit and the body. One of the things that we find the gnostic tradition is that, when Jesus was crucified, only his body was crucified. His spirit resided elsewhere. There's a very famous gnostic Gospel that we have, in which the crucifixion is narrated and recounted by Jesus himself. Standing next to one of his Apostles saying, they have my body down there, but my spirit is up here talking to you. So that sense of ,it is I am thirsty, and it is over. That sense of indifference, I think is true. Because the point being that the spirit that animates the moment Is no longer in the shell of the body and that is, essentially, a gnostic view which means that John was produced from within some kind of a gnostic, or gnostic-influenced community. 

Well, aside from the, perhaps, interest of that as a biblical, as an exercise in biblical textual criticism, it tells us something about what we need to understand in terms of. Using narrative as a concept which is when we think of narrative, we think of it as media narrative, cultural narrative and so on, Hollywood, we think of it as stories that are being told to us right? We think of it as some agent out there telling us a story and then we are consuming that story. __The purpose of this exercise in the Gospels is to give us another insight into narrative. It's not the stories that are being told to us. Narrative at a metacritical level, at a meta, as a metacritical concept means the stories that we are busy telling ourselves. That's the understanding of narrative that we need to carry with us moving forward. What are the stories that we are telling ourselves.__ Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John, represent four different ways of communities telling themselves a story. This gives us an insight, I think, into narrative that helps us move it up a level and use it then critically, conceptually to inform. Our own World.

## 1 - 20 - Week 4 - 3 The Housing Bubble_ home-buying as an investment (10_17)

First, we're going to examine the nature of market participation in straightforward terms. So, we're going to let the participant speak for themselves and find out what they were saying about this market into which they, into which they were buying. And after we've done that, what we'll do is we'll investigate why market participants saw themselves in this way. 

Okay, so Case and Shiller, is there a housing bubble? Or is there a bubble in the housing market? Published in 2003, data collected in 2002. 

First, it should be of some distress, perhaps, to us that they were able to send out the exact same questionnaire in 2002, that they sent out in 1988. To participants in the last bubble. So a mere 14 years between bubbles. And they didn't have to change a single word in their questionnaire, they could send exactly the same thing out, interrogate the same conditions. Second thing we might note about this, 2002, it's important, the timing matters for us here in terms of looking at this case because 2002, is a traditional mortgage origination market. The market that collapsed in 2007, as we all know was contaminated with all of this sub-prime lending. That had gone on. That's not the market we're looking at in 2002. The market in 2002, is overwhelmingly still a traditional mortgage origination market. Which means, you as a home-owner had to put up lots of your own cash to move into a house. You had to put up 15, 20, 25% of the equity in order to secure the rest through a mortgage. 

So, we're not looking at the kind of perversions that take place later in this market through sub-prime lending and so on. We're looking still at traditional patterns of mortgage origination. With that in mind, let's start with this initial premise. __According to the article, according to the data that our authors collected. The overwhelming majority of respondents indicated that they saw their house purchase as an investment.__ Something like 85 or 90% of respondents saw their purchase of a house as an investment. Very few of them actually were planning to use it as an investment, meaning they were not buying a house, then to rent it out and generate returns for capital. Only about 10%, less I think in some cases. But, in terms of how they saw it. 

Let's ask how they saw it as an investment. So, what are the facts that we want to pull out from this, that corresponds to how our market participants evaluated their purchase in investment terms? Once we've done that, we'll then turn to this sort of other factors about where they got this information from and how they came to these points of view, and so on. But let's limit our discussion for the moment simply to this question of evaluating their purchase as an investment. 

So, what would we like to say? What's, what are some of the characteristics that our participants told us about their purchase in that regard. Low risk. How to make cash in the future investment Appreciation. Appreciation of the asset, yep. How much did they expect it to appreciate? About 13.5% per annum, right? So, so it's not only that they expect that house price to go up, they expect it to go up roughly 13.5% per annum, which means, in other words, over a decade, the asset will triple in value.

#### Opportunity costs
- Low interest rates. Comparison of equity vs. assets as to where to park the money.
- Tangible: You can fix a house, you can't see shares.
- Experience: Housing is something you hear about, equities are, "what are equities?" I just trust the guy with experience.
- So there was a lack of trust in equities because of the dot com bubble. And equities are volatile.
- Only an idiot would not take this opportunity, right?

## 1 - 21 - Week 4 - 4 The Housing Bubble_ irrationality in the marketplace

Why house? Low risk. Good. Strong appreciation potential. It will triple in 10 years. Capital protection, you won't lose your money Only an idiot would not take this investment opportunity, would they not? 

In the case of experience, they thought they knew about the market, but as the, the, the case states, there were no consensus among the people why the prices were moving, And there was no analysis of the fundamentals, of why this was happening. So they, they really didn't know about it. __I think to add to that experience thing, people who technically should have had experience in the market weren't saying anything. Real estate agents wanted to sell houses so they're not going to tell you, hey maybe you should take a look at this. Or the banks are going to give you loans because they're going to get interest on it.__ But you know, one of the interesting things is that if you look at the profile of the people who participated in this survey, many of them are actually moving, they already have a house. So many of them are actually, in terms of, in terms of their participation in this market are moving from a, to a house, just to a bigger home presumably, or to another home, better home maybe, so presuming they have some experience already in this market. I think it was about 50-50, so about half of them are 1st time, or maybe, and maybe it was slightly less and then more of them are actually, already homeowners and they're buying, and they're buying up right? So they, they've, they've actually presumably been in these markets already for some period of time. We're looking at a market that's had improving conditions since 1996, roughly 97. So 5 or 6 years at this point. 

__I think many of them probably did have experience. That one of the things that these participants are doing is, sort of, sitting on their, on their house, watching it year to year to year. Going up in, in value.__ I was going to say I felt one of the strangest things I saw in there was the fact that I think that 60% of them had been called, and asked if they wanted to sell their house, when it wasn't even listed, which I think is like, a huge red flag, because that just doesn't happen. Since their house was an investment, they thought housing was good. It actually reinforces this idea of demand. I mean the demand is so robust, that people are actually calling you to sell an asset that you actually, that you haven't listed for, for sale necessarily. So, absolutely. I think it increases that, that sense of demand out there for the asset. 

This is the most compelling market ever. __I mean if you can reduce your risk, guarantee your capital, And triple your money in a decade, and it cost very little to borrow the money to do that, who would not want to jump into that market?__ To put this in perspective, Bernie Madoff was only giving his clients, 6, 7, in change. This is about twice the Madoff standard for, absolutely no-risk capital-preservation constant increase-of-your-money strategy. Twice as good

__What kind of a person would not want to invest, would not invest under these terms?__ Lower risk, higher appreciation potential with a capital guarantee, what's the name, what word wight, might we use to describe a person who would turn down that investment opportunity? A rational investor. I'm going to agree. __The word that we would use to describe someone who would not accept that investment is rational. Because it's not rational. It's an irrational premise. Who really believes that you could lower your risk, guarantee your capital, and get 14% a year?__ 

There's a reason why Bundesbonds give you 0.5%. That's the price of capital protection. You don't get to guarantee your capital and get 14%. It's a very irrational premise indeed, upon which to make an investment. If we stand back, and we evaluate this in basic, grade 7 investment allocation strategies - Your little kid could probably do better - what are we seeing? The trend in equities, so that other asset where we are seeing money being pulled out in order to fund the purchase. What's the trend in equities during this period, 2002? Up or down? Down. What's the trend in housing? >> Up. Up. Okay. They are perceiving equities as volatile, with lower appreciation potential and higher risk. Basic, basic economics. In the aggregate, as the value of an asset class decreases, what happens to it's risk? Does it go up, or down? In the aggregate, as the, as the value of an asset class decreases, what happens to its risk? [CROSSTALK] >> Goes down, right? Positive correlation. As the value of an asset decreases, what happens to its appreciation potential? [CROSSTALK]. Increases. Conversely housing, at upward trend. As the value of an acid increases, what happens to its risk? Goes up. What happens to its appreciation potential? Goes down. So our market participants, are actually reading the market in a perfectly wrong way. 

We've actually taken what would be, what we expect to be the behavior of an asset, and we've simply flipped it. We might summarize their behavior according to a well-known dictum. The lesson, for made for being successful. Which is, what are they doing? [SOUND] Sell low, buy high. It's a guaranteed way to make money every single time, right? If you can consistently sell high, er, I'm sorry, sell low and buy high, you’re just a money making machine. A money making machine. It would make sense if they didn't see it as an investment, if they simply saw it in purely utilitarian terms, why not? 

If my goal is, I simply want to move into a house, fair enough. But insofar as they've specified it, as an investment, I see my purchase of a house as an investment. It then makes sense to map onto that, a kind of investment logic. __When we map, the, the investment allocation logic onto their housing purchase considered as an investment, we come up with, perfectly irrational agents. I define a perfectly irrational agent, as someone who is a perfectly rational agent completely inverted.__ Completely inverted. Right? With, expecting exactly the opposite of what a rational agent would expect. A rational agent would accept that if they want their capital to be protected, that it will come at the cost of lower than average returns. But no, we have people who believe that they can get higher than average returns at lower than average risk. It is a completely, is a perfectly irrational, point of view to hold. So the question that we have is, then in terms of scrutinizing this market, in terms of understanding the participants. Is to ask the question, how did people come to believe, in this, in these terms? How did they come to think of this market in this way? How can we explain this apparently, perfectly irrational behavior? __By the way, the definition of a bubble, is that. When a market that looks like that seems like a very attractive opportunity.__

## 1 - 22 - Week 4 - 5 The Housing Bubble_ context analysis (8_35)

So what we'd like to do today, is there, what we'd like to do now is to consider then, what are the factors to help us explain how this market becomes as irrational as apparently, it became. In fact, we know it was irrational because the market collapsed catastrophically in 2007. And we go back and we look at this and we think, what were people thinking? And some of us go back and think, what was I thinking? Because, not all of us can exempt ourselves from the madness that, that, that took hold. 

So, what do we want to focus on, in terms of explaining how the market got this way. Okay, so we can start by saying I think it's a very basic observation. Clearly we're looking at a question of market psychology, right? There's a psychology here that's afflicting the market and we need to interrogate what that psychology is. So what is the psychology of this market? Where does it come from? How does it take shape? What are the factors that are behind it and so on. So what is the psychology of the market. A herd mentality. Everyone is doing it, I need to do it too. We discussed before this idea of opportunity cost, that sense of urgency. I need to act now if I wait even another year prices are going to get more expensive. 

But, the nature of the good, it's curious, I mean, in some ways wouldn't we predict, given how expensive it is, that people would do, would undertake even more due diligence than they might otherwise. You're putting in hundreds of thousands of dollars, you're indenturing yourself to a bank through a mortgage for like 15, 20, 25 years. They think they did.

Okay, so that's certainly true. __That one of the things about the market pyschology. Is it gives people the impression that they've done the necessary due diligence to make that purchase seem informed.__ Increase in the housing prices. Well so the houses go down, and then they stay flat then starting in 1996 you certainly start to see them coming back up again. 

I've seen past results. As we all know past results are a guarantee of of future results. Where are they getting that idea of, of, of past results? Like, where is that experience coming from? So some of them is from their own experience. _I have a house that's increased in value, I'm going to buy another house that will increase in value more. I know that the price will go up because I can simply map onto the past into the future._ Prices are actually increasing But they're increasing with income. The real price is not increasing, but the nominal price is. The nominal price is increasing. The thing is, we should, right, I mean. 

It's pretty clear, very basic mechanics of what drives the housing market.__Interest rates and income. How much money am I making, ie to put towards the house. And how much does it cost to borrow the money that I don't have.__ I mean there's obviously, other factors at play and, but in the very large sense, if you want to look at overall trends in housing, they follow basically the price of, the price to carry debt, and the amount of money that you make. So income, national income, and national interest rates. That's certainly true. How many of our home buyers though do you think were saying hm I'm going to buy a house, first I want to go investigate current trends in national income? 

So some of then, themselves have personal experience, but where else are they getting that sense, that sense from? They're just hearing what people are saying. Yeah, experience of other people, right? There's all these experiences around you, this accumulated anecdotal evidence. __That is typical of a hot market in which you're hearing these success stories and one of the reasons for that is that you are in a hot market when you are in a market like this and you benefit from that, what do you want to do? Brag about it!__ And so, you know, we accumulate, people accumulate these kinds of success stories anecdotally, in part because, it, I think it's part of our nature, that goes back to this idea of the market psychology. 

__One of the features of the psychology of the market is, it's being reinforced by these kinds of, of success stories.__ And so people are hearing about this and that in forms, I think a little about this idea of they know where the market's going. You had your hand up. __People tend to listen only what they want, although there is positive and negative information available about the market. I suspect that one thing people did not do was to go their local library, pull out their most recent edition of the Brookings Institute journal, and read Case and Shillers argument, and discover that statistically houseing prices are out of whack. What they are going to do is say, yeah, my dentist told me he just sold his house for 40% more than he paid for it two years ago.__ 

I think we didn't say it specifically, but also from the fact that the banker is willing to put down the money. __The banker is willing to give them the money, a very critical factor. Literally the government is, is incentivising through tax incentives to buy the house so when to buy the house it looks good.__ In the U.S. yeah, in the United States it's true because a mortgage is actually deductable off of pretax income which is another it gets another factor which that put under the idea of opportunity costs. Every year that I'm paying rent is a year that I'm paying more taxes than I should Because what I really ought to be doing is sort of capturing that wealth, via sort of this tax preferred or tax advantage scheme, and, and so that's sort of, you know, why would I want to just sort of throw my money away when I could be actually accumulating in tis, this acid and watching it grow. And I should also note that governments are also perhaps promoting policies, you know, prosperity, society and so on. So there's this kind of larger national rhetoric about the value of home ownership. 

At the same time, I think it's also worth noting that this is not a U.S. story, is it? It's not, I mean the housing bubble was not an American phenomenon. Those of us in the room who are from the UK, or from Ireland, or Dubai, or Vilnius, or Barcelona, or any of the other during this period that underwent housing bubbles. We're seeing in fact really a global story, we just happen to be accessing that story through its iteration in the US. But it's not as if this is an American phenomenon by any means, is it?

## 1 - 23 - Week 4 - 6 The Housing Bubble_ the behaviour of market actors (9_49)

We've mentioned the fact that the banks are willing to extend the credit and so this seems to reinforce people's beliefs. What else have we mentioned? We've mentioned friends and family, people that you know. Your sister bought a house, it's worth 20% more. She's an expert on the housing market now, right? Because she's actually sitting on it, because you know, past results are a guarantee of future performance. We might also say the media, what about the media? Full of reports, we've seen, you know what the media looks like, right? Housing prices are up another 15%, so the media's also reinforcing this sense of robust conditions.

What about real estate agents? What are the real estate agents saying in this kind of a market? Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, right? Unless you want to sell, in which it's a great time to sell. But how many, how much trust do you think people put in the real estate agent, as a sort of source of authority. The real estate agent would tell you, oh it's a great place to buy, it's great location. They want the commission. Of course they want the commission, but do you think, yes, I mean, it's a perverse incentive, but do you think people saw the real, real estate agent as a further source of comfort to reinforce their own, their own view? They shouldn't, but do you think they did?

__The funny thing is that you were talking about psychology of the consumers. Even if you give them the truth, some people I do care about, I told them don't do it. They still do it. They think it is for someone else.__ Huh, well, I need, yeah, I think the point is the real estate agent can also be seen as an agent of authority in this market. Even the real estate agent is merely a facilitator of a transaction, right? It's way of bringing buyers and sellers together in a market to make it a little bit more efficient. But then, once the real estate agent becomes a source of authority, this is a great neighborhood, I have been experience, I understand. I've been selling houses in this neighborhood for 30 years, and these prices are great. And these all these reasons why, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

When people are coming to interrogate their own decision making, they can point to the real estate agency. Say yeah, well you know I was talking to, to Jim and he told me, 30 years he's been selling houses in this area. Literally, he told me yesterday this is the best time he's ever seen to buy. Even though prices have doubled in the last, five years. Because, it turns out they were persistently undervalued. Or I'm 25 and I just got a good job so, and I'm about to get married so I'm about to buy a house. Now you would say they would look and they should have thought about it and maybe waited for a few years, buy how long is a few years? __Well yeah, okay, that's a good point because one of the things that we need to it, one of the things that we need to identify here is that timing matters.__ If you are intervening in this market, how likely is it that you're going to make that purchase if you expect prices to fall 20% within 12 months? Because you need a house. And I would argue the answer is very unlikely, right? __You're buying it because you think it's a good time to buy.__

If we take these sources of information together, so we've put a few things up. We've said, friends and family. Media. Real estate agents. Banks. I think what we're seeing here is an example of what I call the information sphere. That is to say, and I borrow that idea of the sphere from the German philosopher, Jurgen Habermas, who talks about the public sphere. But the idea that people eh, have, we exist in a world of information. And we choose to populate, that information sphere from various sources.

So, our friends and family are giving us examples of, you know, you should buy a house for this reason. Your sister bought a house, it went up thirty percent, etcetera. So we're getting this kind of annecdotal evidence. The media's full of reports about, prices are up again another 15% this quarter, another 10% over last year, etcetera. So we're getting this, all this confirmation from the media. Real estate agents are telling us that, this is literally the best time ever to buy a house. They've never seen a better time. So they're giving us information about this. And then finally, and perhaps most importantly, the banks are giving us the most critical piece of information at all. The mortgage, right? Because, surely one of the things that's operating here and I think we said it before, one of the things that's operating here is that people are actually, moving the kind of due diligence we would expect for something like this onto the side of the banks. The logic, and for those of you who bought a house you'll, this will be familiar to you. They wouldn't give me the mortgage, if it weren't safe, because it's much more risk for them than me. Yes, it's $100,000 of my money, but they're giving me $400,000. They're not going to give me $400,000 unless the investment is safe. And that allows you then to exempt yourself from the kind of, perhaps, analysis you might otherwise do, because you can relocate, then, the authority for your decision into the hands of somebody else. In this case, our friendly neighborhood, trustworthy banker, who's able to assess risk on your behalf, and then move you into a nice house. 

__Taking together, what we're seeing here is a classic example of confirmation bias. I want to buy a house so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to find or I'm going to populate my information sphere with sources of information that basically reinforce what I want to do. And the most important of that is the banker because the banker not only confirms your bias, but confirms your bias with the added luster of authority, prestige, and reputation.__ These guys are professionals, they know what they're doing. They wouldn't give me the mortgage unless it were safe. So now I feel confident to go out and buy an asset. And I think it's that element, that sort of, protection if you will, that comes from that reference to authority that helps our home buyers perceive their decision as rational. Essentially they put in the rationality the market into the hands of somebody else. As we know, as the story unfolded, was that a reasonable thing to conclude? No. Because the bankers in fact, were not responsible agents here in this market. They were not extending credit to the market in a responsible way. But from the point of view of the home buyer, from the view point of the market participant him or herself, they didn't know that. And, so the bank becomes a nice place to then plate, to put your trust and your, your sense of security.

## 1 - 24 - Week 4 - 7 The Housing Bubble_ a cognitively dissonant market

If this is a market characterized by systemic confirmation bias there are nonetheless some intriguing instances. Of how our market participants actually saw what was happening around them that's just a little complicated, the story's a little more complicated. 

Basically, have you been influenced by all the hype around the housing market. All these media reports, all these anecdotal stories, all of this sort of stuff that's around you is telling you, housing's a great place. You should be buying. Everybody is making money and so on. __There's all this hype. Have you been influenced by that hype? Most people say no. No, I'm not, I'm not particularly influenced by that.__

Next question. __Can you stop talking about your desire to buy a house? They have the honest answer, no.__ And then they have the dishonest answer that people say sometimes. Right? So how often do you speak about buying your house? Honest answer: always. Those of you bought a house know that this is true, right? __Because, and it makes sense, this is a most important decision, the most important purchase of your life.__ So before you actually commit to it what are you talking about all the time to anyone who will listen? The most important purchase of your life. Right? So, at dinner parties, to your friends, to your mom, all the time, my house this, I saw a house yesterday it was this, I'm looking for that etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So. Always or sometimes, the percentage or respondents, who conceded, that they couldn't stop talking about their desire to buy a house is, what percentage, between 80 and 90%. The vast majority of people admit, that they can't stop talking about the desire to buy a house.

__Put those two together and what you see is. Are you contributing to the hype around the market? Yes. Are you influenced by the hype that you are creating? No.__ 

One of the question says there have been report of people lining up to open houses, putting money down, basically. No questions asked, what describes this kind of behavior in your market and they give them two choices. Whch is to say that the person who has put it on the market doesn't really know the true value and so therefore you have savvy buyers who are rushing in to take advantage of what is essentially an asset being. Being sold at a discount option one or no, people are panicking. Our respondents overwhelmingly agree that when you see that kind of behavior what you are seeing is panic. Right? That's actually about the psychology of the market. 

Next question. Which best describes the market? Market psychology. Nope. Then you give them one that sounds like math. Demographics, income, interest rates. Oh yeah, that sounds, that sounds all edumacated, I'm going to go for that one. Sure it's that one that's what defines the environment of the market. So. __When you look around and you see this behavior in the market in which you bought, what describes it? Market psychology. What describes the market in which you bought? The math.__

There's a term is psychology that we use to describe the emotional state created by holding two mutually exclusive, contradictory ideas in you head at the same time. Cognitive dissonance. You've probably heard the term cognitive dissonance before. Those questions, the answer to those questions are a great example of cognitive dissonance right? And become a part of our marketing respondents. There's all this hype are you influenced by? Nope, that's not me that's somebody else. By the way, you contribute to the hype. Oh, yeah? Then what do you see when you look at all this behavior in the market. I see all this psychology. I see all this panic. What describes your theory of the market? Oh no, it's all about the math, it's not about the psychology the market is very rational. 

Its a cognitively dissident market. Perhaps one of the definitions of a bubble is a bubble is a market which is characterized by its cognitive dissonance. It should give us pause when we see this. But it suggests, right, that the people who are buying did have access to information that was inconsistent with their own reading of their purchase. __People sort of knew that something was going on here, and yet they chose not to include it as part of their sort of informational sphere. They chose not to include that.__

Alright, so they exempted themselves from the implications that that might suggest. Why did they, why did they do such a thing? Are we just irrational? Is that, is that what we should take away? Is economics wrong? We're not rational agents, we're irrational agents? You see a lot of asset bubbles, what's called the __Greater Fool Theory. The concept is that even though I know it's overpriced, I will find somebody who is a bigger fool than I am to buy it at an even higher price?__ Do you think that they, that the market participants based on the survey that we saw that they fought that these assets were unfairly priced? I think they thought in fact, I mean expectation of future price appreciation indicates that the thought that they were buying in a kind of a fair market, fair market value. I'm going to suggest this, this is how we resolve the, the question of the cognitively dissonant market. __Is that people are able to construct for themselves essentially a kind of story that resolved or that, that worked out the contradictions that people were seeing.__ And the argument that I'm going to make for that is you can see the kinds of stories that, that coalesce around this issue. Table 11 contains a very unusual finding in my view. There are some distressing findings, for example almost nobody used any kind of quantitative approach whatsoever when committing hundreds of thousands of dollars to their own, of their own money to the purchase. That should distress us a little bit. 

Social understanding of economics is so low that, essentially nobody used basic metrics but, their is something strange, not distressing just strange in this table. Who noticed something in the table? That they couldn't explain. San Francisco. 1988 Asian Inventors. Think about that for a moment. 1988 San Francisco, when you were walking the streets of San Francisco in 1988, asking San Franciscans about their housing market four out of ten would of told you, it's the Asians. They mean the Japanese. What's going on in San Francisco, 1988? Asian investors, Asian immigrants, should be identified as such a determinant characteristic of that market. 

What does Japan look like in the late 1980s? What's the word that we would use to describe Japan in the late 1980s? Bubble. Huge, epic bubble. They're still recovering from the bubble. Two and a half decades, it's been a very long, painful recovery from one of the most epic bubbles of all time. That's why Japan has the highest level of debt to GDP. They've quantitatively eased. Or tried quantitatively to ease their way out of their problem for two decades by keeping borrowing cost at essentially at zero. Hasn't worked. Why? The trauma of the bubble in the 1980s was so great its probably going to take a generational shift for people to move beyond that event. Prices in, in, in Japan, so what's the story going on here is that, that in 19, over the 1980's like we see the revival, this enormous revival of the Japanese economy, the yen doubles in value over the course of the decade. 

Prices in Japan becomes very very inflated I believe that in the late 1980's in many Japanese cities,you could get a hundred year mortgage. 100 year mortgage. That's a mortgage for you, for your children, for their children. People who've never met you are still paying of your mortgage for like a 20 meter flat somewhere in downtown Tokyo and like who was this guy who thought that this was a good idea?

And so that meant in that, in an environment of those kinds of inflated asset prices, it meant that rent-seeking capital, cash, was looking for fair value elsewhere. And so you saw a lot of outflows, capital outflows from Japan, looking for investments abroad. One of the places that Japanese capital flowed to was the United States. You can, if you're interested, there's a movie that sort of is based on the backdrop of that, called Rising Sun. Which features Wesley Snipes and Sean Connery. But the, the villain in the movie is a cartoonishly evil Japanese businessman, who's come over to buy up U.S assets and do bad things to them. I mean that's the sort of national backdrop here. So that people understand, you know it's kind of a general understanding that all these Japanese capitalist come into the United States and so on and so, this is certainly out there as an idea. 

And yet, it's only in San Francisco where four out of ten people when asked to identify, what are the factors there? Holding up, making your market buoyant, because remember 1988, we're looking at again another housing bubble across a many, many cities in the United States. San Francisco was one of them. When San Franciscans were asked, why only in San Francisco, was the answer, it's the Japanese, why not LA, Boston? What's going on? How am I, we explain that? Well, the question you might ask is, what U.S. city has the largest Japanese American population? Honolulu. What American city has the second largest Japanese population? New York. What city has the third? San Francisco is a city very characterized by Japanese-American culture. Right? From the turn of the century a lot of Japanese-American settled in San Francisco. So there is, it seems a kind of cultural predisposition in San Francisco is a result of their particular circumstances to take what's this sort of larger national context and have it coalesced into what's basically a local story, real estate's local, right? 

That local story in San Francisco tapped into this larger story and made it a local, the word I would use is, narrative. That was the story that San Franciscans were telling themselves about their market. Boston, L.A, who knows. But in San Francisco, if you want to understand why prices are high and will stay high. Japanese. Who knows how it was started, maybe it was an article in the San Francisco Chronicle. Japanese investors love San Francisco for the fresh sushi. Who you don't know. Maybe there was some kind of word of mouth spread around but at some point. That idea coalesced and became the local story that San Franciscans told themselves. Once they have told themselves that story, became true. And that's why we see it on survey four out of ten responding voluntarily, about the local conditions in 1988, that was the story that San Francisco's were telling themselves about their market, was it true? No. Did it support their market? No. Did housing prices collapse in San Francisco? Yes. But it was a good story to tell you so far it lasted.

## 1 - 25 - Week 4 - 8 The Housing Bubble_ why didn't the Federal Reserve act

Case and Shiller, literally the two most famous, prominent economists of the housing market, the index in the United States, the tracks. The housing prices bears their name. You don't get more prestigious than these guys. 2002, the two most important economists write an article saying, please review both our qualitative and our quantitative evidence to see if there are bubble conditions in the market. Who is this article being written for? This is actually a private conversation, basically, between the two most prominent economists of the housing market on one side, who's on the other side of that conversation? Alan Greenspan, right? Alan Greenspan sets interest rates. 

__What's the best, easiest way to prick a bubble? Raise the cost of credit, right? Because housing prices relate to the price of credit. If it's simply too expensive to borrow the money that you need to move into a house, you're not going to move into that house at that price.__ 

So, this is essentially a private conversation between Case and Shiller on the one hand and Alan Greenspan on the other. Saying, dear Mr. Greenspan, look at the numbers that we've got for you. Look at what people are thinking when they look at this market. They expect higher than average return, lower than average risk. It's a cognitive dissonant market; you should do something about it. This is dangerous, look at the conclusions that they give. It's couched in “economese”, but let me tell you for economese; it's pretty dire. We might see replenishment of the savings rate, collapse in consumer confidence and so on. Right, bad outcomes in other words, if this market, if it a bubble, when it falls, there could be very dire consequences, indeed. You should act. 

What did the Federal Reserve board choose to do in 2002, 2003? Keep interest rates at record lows, right? I think it was at, like, 0.5, or 0.75, something like that. Very, very low after the, after the collapse of the stock market, an attempt to try and spur recovery. Interest rates are at record lows. __Here, the two most prominent economists, the housing market present, I think we would argue, unimpeachable evidence. That there is a bubble or bubble conditions forming. That the expectation of market participants are characterized by irrationality. The math of the article makes it pretty clear that prices are no longer tethered to the underlying fundamentals. What does the Federal Reserve Board choose to do, given that evidence? Nothing whatsoever.__ 

Why? Why, did Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve board choose to ignore the evidence that there were housing bubble conditions forming in the market, with all of the attendant dire consequences? I'm going to submit to you, it's because the minds at the Federal Reserve Board knew something that Case and Shiller didn’t, which was that their findings were irrelevant because their reading of the market was outdated. This was a different market than the market in 1988. Therefore, using this of kind methodology didn't make sense. They were bringing basically, old tools to a new reality. Because this market, the market of 2002, was characterized by much, much more effective mechanisms to disperse risk. It was a much more efficient market than the market in 1988. 

__In other words: don't worry, this time is different. It's going to be okay. The reason I feel comfortable in saying that is because, if we look at Alan Greenspan, if we look at his record over the period that he was a central banker, one of the things that we find Alan Greenspan saying over and over and over again is, this is a new market.__ There are new ways of dispersing risk, more efficient than ever, and we should just leave it alone, and everything will be fine. We also know this because, there were numerous attempts, late 1980s, late 1990s on, by the government of the United States, to regulate this new market for risk dispersal. We now know them as CDOs and CDSs, secondary and tertiary derivative products, synthetic derivative products, packaged, sliced and diced securitised, securitised instruments and so on. There were numerous attempts to regulate that, that market, because it was a market characterized by opacity. There wasn't a lot of transactional clarity in that market and so, there were all these voices saying, we should bring more regulation to this market; we should ensure that people know what's going on here. 

And every single time, I shouldn't say every single time, but over and over and over again, the voice that was raised. The voice that had the most authority and persuasiveness that was raised against regulating this market. That voice belonged to, guess who - Alan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan gave speeches, gave testimony, would tell anyone who'd listen, do not introduce unnecessary regulation to this secondary and tertiary market. It's very effective. There are good moral hazard guards in place. It's extremely good at dispersing risk, and ultimately, it helps make everybody more prosperous because of that new risk dispersal mechanism. So don't mess it up by imposing some kind of a regulatory regime over it.

Now, as we know Alan Greenspan got that wrong because he went back to Congress and told them that he'd made a mistake, which is rare, because usually essential bankers simply hide from their mistakes, you don't hear from them much. So actually, to have to go back and say, yeah maybe got a couple of the details wrong, is really quite remarkable. Why had Alan Greenspan and other member of the Fed, how had they gotten it so wrong? How could they have so misread these circumstances? Greenspan said, well, I misread the ability of the banks to act in a way that was in the interest of their shareholders. As if the principal age in problem had never existed before 19, in 2007. Give bankers a whole lot of incentive and a whole lot of ways to make a ton of money and be shocked that they decide to do so. Really? Good heavens. Why had Greenspan and the Fed, why did they make such a colossal mistake? Why didn't they, take this article as a clarion call to raise rates, prick the bubble now, avoid the catastrophic consequences? Instead, what did they do? They kept interest rates low and what was already a bad situation became much, much worse such that when it finally did collapse in 2007, we almost went into global-wide economic catastrophe. 

I'm going to argue it's because Alan Greenspan had told himself a story. He told himself a story about risk dispersal. He told himself a story about efficient markets that these tertiary, secondary and tertiary derivative instruments were exactly what he said they were, in his own mind. That they were, in fact, effective mechanisms at moving risk into a much larger market, and therefore, it was different this time. Therefore, it was a different kind of market, and therefore, these kinds of findings weren't relevant. And once he told himself that story, that was the truth that he acted on. Became his truth. That's the problem; that's the power of narrative. Once we've told ourselves that story, we don't know that it's a story; we just know that it's true. Whether it's Japanese investors, who are supporting your house price in San Francisco in 1988. Or whether it's the efficient operation of a market that's obviously in catastrophic bubble territory, because of these wonderful new instruments available to us, to disperse risk. The stories that we tell ourselves operate as our truth. Unless we try to interrogate them as stories.

## 1 - 26 - Week 4 - 9 Narrative structures and Managerial decisions_ concluding remarks (8_12)

A lot of management decisions are also taken based on the stories that we tell ourselves, sometimes with catastrophic results. And I want to suggest to you that this is exactly what's going on when we look at the world's worst merger. That's a competitive field. There are a lot of candidates out there for the world's worst merger but that title current. If we measure it in terms of the eradication of investor equity, who holds that crown currently? AOL-Time Warner. Right? AOL and Time Warner, the gold standard for bad mergers. If you're really looking to merge in a catastrophic way, go check out what AOL-Time Warner did. They're going to give you the benchmark that you have to that you have to exceed. 

AOL-Time Warner wiped out about a quarter of a trillion dollars worth of investor equity as a result of their 1999/2000 merger that brought together the world's largest platform for getting people online with Time Warner, which as we know has all this robust content. Question. Why did AOL-Time Warner merge? What was the logic that informs, that merger. The answer to that question is, well, the answer to that question is there wasn't very good logic.If you go back to the Internet way back in the early days of the Internet, whooo, in 1996, 97, 98, 99, those early days of the Internets. The Internet was a problem everybody knew it was this wonderful new tool, it was this great new technology, it was going to to usher in a new world. The information revolution was at hand.

But there was a problem with the internet which was, it was great, you could get online, but once you were there, what did you do? Content was the problem. And so there was this strategy that adduced to resolve this problem known as convergence. Getting on, online platforms and content had to converge. Essentially, it was the television model, it was the radio model. When you turn on the television, something is being delivered to you, right, if you don't like it, you can change the channel, and so on. But essentially, somebody else is responsible for sending content to you. That was how the problem of the Internet was being perceived, this question of convergence. And so there was a lot of discussion in the late 1990s about convergence strategies. Experts, panellists and the media, people, all these conferences that were held. All people, all these people were talking about how are we going to converge, how are we going to bring about a strategy of convergence? 

AONL, AOL and Time Warner exemplified, convergence. Because you're taking the world's largest company in terms of getting people online and you're combing with the one of the world's largest company in terms of giving, providing robust content and you're putting them together. And it's win, win, win, that way you win the information age. Because, you're getting all these people online and you're giving them the content, may be that they don't want. But it's pretty good.

I like to think, I don't know for sure but, I like to think that when the CEOs or case 11 who made this deal over dinner then sent out their minions to go work out the details of the, of the merger. That those minions, people like you and me, almost certainly would have been using a tool to find out bits of information in order to help put the merger together. That tool we call today, Google, right? Google had been around four years already, because it started in 96. 1999 a lot of people were using Google. So, I'm sure they were using Google to sort of find out bits of information that they needed in order to make this merger happen. The curious thing is that, Google makes nonsense of a strategy of convergence, because Google gives you an effective and reliable tool that enables you to go out and get the content that you want. You don't need content delivered to you with a tool like Google. You become your own autonomous agent in the world of the Internet, so how is it that you can have the strategy put together to comply with the imperative of conversions, while at the same time using a tool that makes nonsense of the logic of that strategy in the first place? 

Levine, the CEO of, of, of Time Warner in, in an article in 2009 or 2010 published in the New York Times. Was quoted as saying, well in 2000 no one could have anticipated Google. True, except for those many millions of people who were already using it. They didn't need to anticipate it, it was already there. How is it that they didn't see Google made nonsense of this strategy at least gave them pause? And certainly I should not that some people did. And indeed within a very short time of the merger have been signed, it was clear that some catastrophic results were going to happen. I'm going to argue that the reason is because once they had told themselves that story, we have to converge became their truth. 

It's another example of a narrative driven strategy. AOL, Timewarner, they certainly weren't alone, many other companies, told themselves, if we want to succeed in the information age, if we want to be able to be out front of the information revolution, we have to converge. If we don't converge, we won't survive. Once they told themselves they had to converge, they had no access. To an idea that might suggest convergence was rapidly becoming obsolete, they told themselves a story, and once they told themselves the story, they knew it to be true. 

__Which leaves us with the question and I'm sure we can all if we interrogate our own behavior, recognize that we have ourselves often told ourselves stories. And then acted on them, because we know them to be true, only later to find out, ooh, maybe that wasn't as true as we thought. __

How can we avoid this? Sadly, I don't have a magic formula. There's no easy recipe. There's no simple three-step process. There's no book that I can point you to, how to avoid becoming a victim of your own narrative. The only thing I can suggest is that we go back to the wisdom of an ancient Greek philosopher with an attitude problem, Socrates. He who is at the sort of very beginning of the humanistic enterprise. What was the Socratic, point about true wisdom? True wisdom, consists in knowing you are not wise. The greatest knowledge that you have is knowing that you do not know. In other words, there is never a point where get to stop asking questions or there is never a point where you shouldn't be interrogating critically the decision making, the logic that you're bringing to your own decision making. If we can perhaps apply that kind of Socratic impulse, maybe I don't know, maybe I don't have all the answers. That's I think the easiest or at least the best, I don't think there's an easy way but it's at least the best way, to avoid this kind of trap of narrative thinking. It's remarkably rare, sadly. Very smart people fall victim to these kinds of narrative frames. But it is perhaps the best way that we have to try and get ourselves outside of it.
