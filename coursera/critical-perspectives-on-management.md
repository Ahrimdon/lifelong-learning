## 0: Before We Begin

The first two weeks are drawn from the same reading. We're going to go back 2000 years ago and look at how the Romans managed to bring grain to the city of Rome which was a, a very large city.

The first week we're actually going to use that that topic to discuss the very fundamentals of what a market is and what a firm is in the context of a, of a market.

Why does the Roman green trade matter to us. It probably surprised you to see that the Romans had this kind of tax credit policy in order to encourage certain kinds of of trade. So if you predicted that a market that doesn't have information cannot actually bring green to Rome.

What's the precondition for capitalization, knowing something about the returns your capital is going to generate. That question was relevant 2,000 years ago. That question is still relevant today.

And we're going to be looking at the mechanism that firms use called the force distribution ranking scheme. We're going to be evaluating it to see what kinds of outcomes it generates for firms informed by actually the Roman case that we have still before us.

Since the 1930s, the average life expectancy of a firm has fallen by more than half. So there seems to be any number of reasons why, perhaps you might end up with sub-optimal outcomes as a result of a scheme like this.

It's a critical question for our general capitalist economy. And it's a critical question we will be considering over the rest of this class, indeed.

True wisdom consists of knowing you're not wise. The true knowledge is knowing that you do not know. And the point about that is then, there's never a point where you stop asking questions. There's never a point where you stop interrogating the world around you. You should never be satisfied with the answers at hand, must always be maintaining a kind of critical perspective on things.

You can imagine a lifetime spent going around annoying people by questioning everything you know is not perhaps the way to win friends and influence people, but as a methodology I think it's fundamental and critical. Certainly it is the methodology, the methodological impulse that informs our class.

## Reading on the Roman Grain Train

#### INTRODUCTION

- Rome is 1M by 1st century CE. It was the largest city ever until London surpassed it in the 19th century. The Colosseum seats 50K. 10K people bathe daily in the bathhouses.
- The average Roman needed a daily requirement of around 3K calories a day, or 3B calories daily. 629 tons/wheat/day, 412 tons/wine/day, 119 tons/olive oil/day, 117 tons/honey/day.
- Transporting shit via land was very expensive, and the only economical way to transport goods in quantity over any longer distance is by boat. This is why all large cities in the pre-modern world are port cities.
- Even though that was the case, no other European city can grow beyond 100K residents. Rome was able to do it becase of the political, military, economic, and social conditions that were created as the Roman Empire started to expand aggressively.
- The containers, _amphorae_, were often marked with information about the goods being transported.
- Each province developed specialized production: Baetica (modern Andalusia) and Tunisia specialized in olive oil, Greece/Italy/Spain/France specialized in wine, Egypt/Africa specialized in wheat. Wheat was usually 80% of the caloric intake of an average Roman.

#### THE GRAIN TRADE TO THE CITY OF ROME

- To provide healthy yields, wheat requires both suitable soil and sufficient rainfall. So nothing on Italy and anywhere else asides from NAfrica and the Nile delta.
- Wheat requires a minimum rainfall of 400 mm. Less and the entire crop would fail.
- Wheat is heavy and bulky to move about. Merchants who shipped grain had to ensure that their ships were sufficiently strong to withstand wheat pressure.
- Wheat "breathes" after it is harvested. Unless it is kept cool and dry it fosters conditions for mold/fungi to develop, causing the grain to rot.
- It is actually cheaper to send a shipload of grain the entire length of the Mediterranean than to cart it overland over 100km.
- It is important to maintain controls by carefully counting the sacks delivered, measuring the amounts and determinng the quality.
- We have specialized workers (counters, measurers) and supervisors to manage the process.
- There was a physical infrastructure that was devoted to the storage and delivery of grain.
- What needed to exist?  A system, with farmers, dockworkers, sailors, ship-owners, merchants, and financiers. Engineering for the ships, ports, and roads. Lawyers to draw up contracts. Judges to adjudicate during moments of dispute. A monetary system to allow long distance trade to flourish. A bureaucracy to ensure the stability of supply. A highly complex supply chain.

#### ROMAN TRADE

- Roman empire drew upon the surplus resources from the territories it conquered. Taxes were paid in cash.
- They shifted from taxation to monetary payments, which spawned the dev't of markets, increasing division of labor and growth in the Roman world.
- Land grants were given to the Roman citizens. These financed the trade that brought goods from the periphery to the center.
- While the overall pattern of trade weighted in the direction of Rome, the peripheral regions (Britain, Libya, Syria) expanded a few centuries later.

#### THE HARVESTING OF GRAIN

- Under Roman rule, Egypt was largely peaceful and prosperous. Egypt was the breadbasket of the Roman world. 
- Although Egypt is very dry, predictable seasonal variations in river height meant that farmers on the banks of the Nile could easily irrigate their crops using a technique known as basin irrigation.

#### FINANCING AND ORGANISING THE GRAIN TRADE

- There was a network of private merchants who found a profitable business importing tons of grains into Rome.
- These came from those who had disposable wealth: a small, powerful elite divided into several social classes.
- Some came from the Knights, originally wealthy families that could afford to provide cavalry for the Roman army.
- Freedmen were the glue of the Roman economy. These were former slaves, freed either by hard work, or else because they were freed by their owner. Many of Rome's most successful merchants were from slave families who, upon gaining their freedom, turned to trade.
- The operations (_societas_) were like modern corporations. Partners provided the capital, and the companies existed legally, signed contracts, maintained accounts, and paid dividends.- Companies owned or subcontracted ships, they had accountants, they employed (directly or indirectly) workers at both ends of the supply chain, and they may had a physical infrastructure. The ships were designed and optimized to carry grain.
- There were also government decrees, which lay out various financial incentives for ship-owners to build their ships to carry grain for Rome.
- The Roman grain corporations also employed a network of agents: local buyers, logistical staff, and overseers.
- Finally, individual grain merchants banded together to form what looks much like a modern-day trade association.
- We can presume that much of the structural and organizational (or cross-organisational) behaviour of the grain merchants was driven by one central concern that we might think no longer has much relevance: the problem of information.

#### INFORMATIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND THE ROMAN MARKET

- No modern communications tech then. Ther was a courier service (_cursus publicus_) that was established, but it was expensive, confined to state use, and was limited to the speed of a horse travelling over the Roman road system.
- Market information existed exclusively in a local context.
- Roman firms had a hierarchical structure to manage operations. The problem though, was the principal agent problem (how do you get agents to act in the interest of the principal as opposed to themselves). Coordinating the buying and selling was hard because of the time/distance problems.
- Key points:

	- Contracts. Binding legal documents.
	- Quality control, weights, measures meant there awas verification throughout the points of the supply chain.
	- Grain merchants had some sort of insurance from the state.
	- There was a paper trail (receipts) throughout the process.

> Given to Didymus by Posidonius, master of eight boats carrying 40,000 artabae20 in the Neaspoleos administration, I have received and had measured out to me the amount ordered by you, in accordance with the order of his excellency the procurator Neaspoleos, from public granaries of the said village at the river Tomis (a specified amount of) wheat, produce of the year (specified), unadulterated, with no admixture of earth or barley, untrodden and sifted, which I will carry to Alexandria and deliver to the officials of the administration safely, free of all risk, and damage by ship. This receipt is valid, there being three copies of it, of which I have issued two to you.21

- How about internal information within the firm? Trust and the freedmen loyalty to the family who they got freedom from. The owner-slave relationship was critical to the best interests of the stakeholder given the available information. The Romans' reputation was used to guard against moral hazard.

#### THE ROLE OF THE STATE

- The state had two focal points that determined its interest and involvement in the grain trade: the army and the metropolis of Rome.
- Three interventions: investment, incentivisation, and distribution.

	- Rome's main port, as Ostia, was rebuilt to accommodate more ships and to increase the dockside storage capacity.
	- Through various decrees, the gov't promoted the construction of larger ships, by granting special tax privileges.
	- The state also recognized the status of grain merchants, who, as I noted above, protected their collective interest by banding together into _collegia_, or associations.
	- By promoting the construction of larger ships, the state also played a role in deferring the upfront capital costs that were needed in order to respond to the city’s and the army’s need for growing supply.
	- Finally, the Roman government was the single largest purchaser of grain. Gov't wheat subsidized 30-40% of the city's population.By the Imperial period, there were almost 300 public bakeries in the city.

- Although it has been pointed out that the scale of private trade was larger than that paid for by the public purse and destined for state granaries, the fact that the state was by far the single biggest player means that it surely had a disproportionate effect on the market environment. State actions like subsidising larger ships, granting monopoly guarantees, providing portside facilities, and setting prices must have played a dominant role in determining the disposition of the market as a whole. Grain was too essential a commodity to be left entirely to free market forces.

#### SEVERAL REMARKS BY WAY OF A CONCLUSION

- The system collapsed in the third century (ca. 250 AD), when the food supply was disrupted and collapsed.
- Once Rome ceased to be the main consumer of available surplus, other parts of the Empire started to expand. 

## 1.1: The Roman Grain Trade: Introduction

What is it about the city of Rome being a million people that should be worth our attention? 

- Transportation. Big challenge.
- Interlinked state with corporate and business interests via policies.
- Size matters because of teh nature and the length of time that Rome was able to sustain that population. That's like half a millenium. We're looking to get to be that optimally efficient.

## 1.2: The Problem of Informaton

It's a, it's essentially a market in which there is a persistent informational uncertainty. There are informational asymmetries, that is to say that parties to transactions in this market have unequal levels of information.

And yet, the market did function, and it functioned spectacularly well, despite not having what we would think of as this enabling condition: enough information to entice capital to enter the market to get it functioning.

How did the Romans manage to generate an optimally efficient or near optimally efficient market absent what we would identify as a core enabling condition, without which we would predict the market couldn't function?

If we can give the market information, we can get that market to function, because a market that has information is a market then, that can function.

Where does the information start in this market? What's the beginning point of information in this market? It's the seed of grain that the farmer plants in the ground. Because that seed carries with it a certain amount of price information, so you know how much it costs to put in the ground and the labor and so on.

So if we start with, does it start, I should add, does it start with the population in Rome that wants bread? Based on that then you know how much bread you need to produce. Okay, so if you don't have the hungry Romans, you don't know how much bread to produce. Well Oh, no, but it's always need that triggers the production. The need that triggers production, where
is the need in our hypothetical market, where does the need start?

So actually, the problem, if we were to think, okay, the information starts with a hungry population in Rome, that actually presupposes the functioning of the market. Problem is we're not there yet, we don't have a market that functions, because we've predicted that a market that doesn't have information cannot actually bring grain to Rome.

So it starts then with the grain that goes in the ground, and the need that attaches to that, which is the need of a farmer, him or herself. And so if the farmer grows the grain and produces enough for himself or herself and adds a little extra supply, at that point, now we have surplus agriculture and it starts to move into the market.

It's already at the point where they, they are the ones who are exchanging information, so the information is the right information. Yeah they have, essentially all of the knowledge that they need, in order to eliminate for potential problems in that transaction, right?

The farmer knows how much he needs to sell the wheat for, the grain for. The person who's collecting it knows how much she is willing to pay, and so, when they come to, when they're parties to that transaction, they have good information, which means that there is transactional efficiency in that information.

And then as the grain moves off the farm into the cart, it carries with it that good information. And as if we imagine simply moving up our supply chain and we'll use the case of Egypt here because it was the one that was in, outlined in the case.

If we follow that supply chain along, at every moment where there is a transaction, so when Georgianna sells it to Antonio sells it to Amaranth and so on, every time they're engaging in a transaction, what is the nature of information in that transaction, good or bad?

Good. Why? Quantity, price, quality. You are not constrained into the transaction. (Different buyers and sellers exist at every point in the supply chain.) Because you assume the risk for your part in the chain, then you have to make sure that your good is of sufficient quality, and it is exactly what's ordered.

Because it's subject to locally competitive forces, if the farmer is asking too much for the grain, you could simply go to another farmer. And if the donkey and cart operation is asking too much, you find somebody else and so the locally competitive forces further reinforce the efficiency of the market and so you have transactional relationships which are characterized by good information in a locally competitive environment, which suggests you have a efficient market indeed, right?

Lastly, what is the problem of the Roman who buys the bread? Price. It can be too expensive because of so many intermediaries. How do you solve the problem of transaction costs?

If the problem of the market is a lack of information, isn't the best way to solve then for the information, to solve for that problem of information, simply to introduce a transactional environment where information is passed efficiently along from person to person to person. But the market can only extend out as far as those transactions costs allow, which in this case might be, who knows, somewhere on the upper Nile.

Beyond that, it's simply too expensive and there is no market. So as we've seen, when we saw for the problem of information in the market, we do so at the expense of unacceptably high transaction costs. Meaning, that the market cannot function, since the cost using the market to move to grain to Rome is simply too high.

The paradox of the market is it doesn't have enough information. We have given the market now the information that it needs, but we have done so with the expense of unacceptability high cost, which means we are now closer to solving the central dilemma: how did the Romans manage to get this market working?

## 1.3: The Problem of Transaction Costs

How did the Romans solve then for this transaction cost problem; what did they do?

Competition. Competition between merchants, and the government was also involved.

So what's the problem we need to solve for now? Drive down transaction costs by competition, through recording the same transaction? One of the ways to do it might be through competition, so you can strain the ability of individual intermediaries to, to overcharge.

So you try and optimize the price mechanism, as we call it. Would that be sufficient, though, given the number of intermediaries that we've pointed out here?

Even if we introduce optimally efficient circumstances in each one of those locally, in those local transactional environments, would that be sufficient to drive down transaction costs enough to let our hungry Roman have his morning bread?

A kind of vertical integration in a way, by creating a company. What do we call vertical integration? A company, a firm.

Why does a firm exist? answer that he came up with, now we call it the Transactional Theory of the Firm. The firm is merely an organizationally efficient response to a market transaction problem.

So, when you have a market, the cost of using it which is high, so there is a high cost of using the market, organizing operations through a firm, coordinating the activities of all those entrepreneurs under the umbrella of the firm allows you systematical to reduce the transactions costs of that market.

It is cheaper to put your donkey and cart man on salary and have him go around and collect the surplus grain, than it is to pay them individually every single time that there's a transaction, simply systematically reduces the cost.

It's a dominant theory, that at a very basic level a firm is merely than an organizational response to a transaction cost problem. And our case in Rome, I think, illustrates that very clearly, 'because that's what the Romans did.

That's why they developed essentially, a firm driven response to using the market. Entrepreneurial driven response to using the market, leads to unacceptably high transaction cost. When you move it to a firm, so that is to say, when you domesticate many of those transactions under the umbrella of a single organization, you create efficiencies. It becomes cheaper and that reduces the overall cost of using the market.

It was estimated that the additional cost of moving grain from, I believe it was Spain to Rome, so that is to say, all of the attendant costs in of, of the supply chain, added only 16% to the cost of the product. Which, if we think about the time period, is a pretty remarkable achievement, to be able to reduce the cost of using the market to only 16% of the value of the good.

So the question then is how were the Romans able to derive a firm driven response. What was it that they had? What could they do that allowed them to use the firm as an efficient response to this market dilemma? And as we know, the problem with a firm is what? What happens, as soon as you have a firm, you may get transactional cost efficiencies, but you get it at the expense of something else. What do we call that?

Bureaucracy. Moral hazard. The divergence of interests between the people who own the company or supply the capital, and the interests of the people who are charged with going out and generating the rents that that capital is seeking. Known in the literature as the principal-agent problem. In very broad way, we might simply say that a firm is merely a principal-agent problem that has been more or less effectively solved.

But it's a very serious problem right, the principal-agent problem? Because if I give somebody a whole bunch of money and I send them out and they go a thousand kilometers away, to act on my behalf, but I have no idea what they're doing, am I likely to lend them money in the first place? Am I likely to capitalize the system in the first place? No.

What makes, what's the precondition for capitalization? Knowing something about the returns your capital is going to generate.

Rome was a city of a million people for 500 years in a persistently informationally uncertain environment. Which means that they must have had a well capitalize market, a well functioning market. How was it that they were able to resolve for the principal-agent problem of the firm, in order to generate the capital that the market needed to function?

## 1.4: Transactions and the Agency Dilemma

How was it that they were able to resolve for the principal agent problem of a firm, in order to generate the capital that the market needed to function? What did they do? They had freedmen agents.

So, we have here, in a sense, an opportunity to consider the firm at a very basic level, which I think, from the point of view is management, is fundamental. Because it's strips so many externalities from the question of the firm. And invites us to think of the firm in a very, in, in the terms of its very pure functioning.

In a modern scenario, if you wanted to see a similar kind of mechanism, let's look at employee stock options. But in the Romans, it was because of teh slavery that enabled the Romans to compensate.

Now, we have loyalty to the firm. And fear, a bit. But reputation. Social inclusion and social exclusion, if you did not respect the moral contract, you had the risk of being socially excluded, and therefore not being able to earn a living.

Stuff such as contracts or inspecting ships were quality controls. Internal mechanisms in firms are governed not by coercive stuff such as QC but by being self-governed. Reputation and trust.

Now, we have emails or weekly reports. They had receipts. Which are super sub-optmal.

Alfred Chandler, said that managerial hierarchies are what make a firm. Without it you just have entrepreneurs in shops. You can't have the firm without the telegraph and the railroad. Until the information can move at the speed of an electron, so that you can monitor people in far far-flung places, the firm is a very unlikely entity to exist.

If you don't have an ability to monitor, why would you erect a firm in the first place? It's simply too much risk for capital. There are other, better ways to generate returns for your capital than entering into a risky organizational proposition like this one.

And yet the Romans were able to do this. They were able to do so in a way that led to optimal, optimal results, optimal market efficiencies. And what did they have? They had, in addition to these other coercive, its extra-organizational institutions, they had this mechanism of reputation.

Which invites us then to focus on the mechanism of reputation, to ask us about the question of incentive since it seems to be, this is what the Roman grain trade tells us, it seems to be fundamental to how firms work.

And what it suggests is well, one of the things we need to think very carefully about is this question of reputation, trust, and incentive. What kinds of reputational, trust, and incentive mechanisms are we putting in place in our organization in order to optimize outcomes?
