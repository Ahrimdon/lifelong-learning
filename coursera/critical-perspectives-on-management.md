## 0: Before We Begin

The first two weeks are drawn from the same reading. We're going to go back 2000 years ago and look at how the Romans managed to bring grain to the city of Rome which was a, a very large city.

The first week we're actually going to use that that topic to discuss the very fundamentals of what a market is and what a firm is in the context of a, of a market.

Why does the Roman green trade matter to us. It probably surprised you to see that the Romans had this kind of tax credit policy in order to encourage certain kinds of of trade. So if you predicted that a market that doesn't have information cannot actually bring green to Rome.

What's the precondition for capitalization, knowing something about the returns your capital is going to generate. That question was relevant 2,000 years ago. That question is still relevant today.

And we're going to be looking at the mechanism that firms use called the force distribution ranking scheme. We're going to be evaluating it to see what kinds of outcomes it generates for firms informed by actually the Roman case that we have still before us.

Since the 1930s, the average life expectancy of a firm has fallen by more than half. So there seems to be any number of reasons why, perhaps you might end up with sub-optimal outcomes as a result of a scheme like this.

It's a critical question for our general capitalist economy. And it's a critical question we will be considering over the rest of this class, indeed.

True wisdom consists of knowing you're not wise. The true knowledge is knowing that you do not know. And the point about that is then, there's never a point where you stop asking questions. There's never a point where you stop interrogating the world around you. You should never be satisfied with the answers at hand, must always be maintaining a kind of critical perspective on things.

You can imagine a lifetime spent going around annoying people by questioning everything you know is not perhaps the way to win friends and influence people, but as a methodology I think it's fundamental and critical. Certainly it is the methodology, the methodological impulse that informs our class.

## Reading on the Roman Grain Train

#### INTRODUCTION

- Rome is 1M by 1st century CE. It was the largest city ever until London surpassed it in the 19th century. The Colosseum seats 50K. 10K people bathe daily in the bathhouses.
- The average Roman needed a daily requirement of around 3K calories a day, or 3B calories daily. 629 tons/wheat/day, 412 tons/wine/day, 119 tons/olive oil/day, 117 tons/honey/day.
- Transporting shit via land was very expensive, and the only economical way to transport goods in quantity over any longer distance is by boat. This is why all large cities in the pre-modern world are port cities.
- Even though that was the case, no other European city can grow beyond 100K residents. Rome was able to do it becase of the political, military, economic, and social conditions that were created as the Roman Empire started to expand aggressively.
- The containers, _amphorae_, were often marked with information about the goods being transported.
- Each province developed specialized production: Baetica (modern Andalusia) and Tunisia specialized in olive oil, Greece/Italy/Spain/France specialized in wine, Egypt/Africa specialized in wheat. Wheat was usually 80% of the caloric intake of an average Roman.

#### THE GRAIN TRADE TO THE CITY OF ROME

- To provide healthy yields, wheat requires both suitable soil and sufficient rainfall. So nothing on Italy and anywhere else asides from NAfrica and the Nile delta.
- Wheat requires a minimum rainfall of 400 mm. Less and the entire crop would fail.
- Wheat is heavy and bulky to move about. Merchants who shipped grain had to ensure that their ships were sufficiently strong to withstand wheat pressure.
- Wheat "breathes" after it is harvested. Unless it is kept cool and dry it fosters conditions for mold/fungi to develop, causing the grain to rot.
- It is actually cheaper to send a shipload of grain the entire length of the Mediterranean than to cart it overland over 100km.
- It is important to maintain controls by carefully counting the sacks delivered, measuring the amounts and determinng the quality.
- We have specialized workers (counters, measurers) and supervisors to manage the process.
- There was a physical infrastructure that was devoted to the storage and delivery of grain.
- What needed to exist?  A system, with farmers, dockworkers, sailors, ship-owners, merchants, and financiers. Engineering for the ships, ports, and roads. Lawyers to draw up contracts. Judges to adjudicate during moments of dispute. A monetary system to allow long distance trade to flourish. A bureaucracy to ensure the stability of supply. A highly complex supply chain.

#### ROMAN TRADE

- Roman empire drew upon the surplus resources from the territories it conquered. Taxes were paid in cash.
- They shifted from taxation to monetary payments, which spawned the dev't of markets, increasing division of labor and growth in the Roman world.
- Land grants were given to the Roman citizens. These financed the trade that brought goods from the periphery to the center.
- While the overall pattern of trade weighted in the direction of Rome, the peripheral regions (Britain, Libya, Syria) expanded a few centuries later.

#### THE HARVESTING OF GRAIN

- Under Roman rule, Egypt was largely peaceful and prosperous. Egypt was the breadbasket of the Roman world. 
- Although Egypt is very dry, predictable seasonal variations in river height meant that farmers on the banks of the Nile could easily irrigate their crops using a technique known as basin irrigation.

#### FINANCING AND ORGANISING THE GRAIN TRADE

- There was a network of private merchants who found a profitable business importing tons of grains into Rome.
- These came from those who had disposable wealth: a small, powerful elite divided into several social classes.
- Some came from the Knights, originally wealthy families that could afford to provide cavalry for the Roman army.
- Freedmen were the glue of the Roman economy. These were former slaves, freed either by hard work, or else because they were freed by their owner. Many of Rome's most successful merchants were from slave families who, upon gaining their freedom, turned to trade.
- The operations (_societas_) were like modern corporations. Partners provided the capital, and the companies existed legally, signed contracts, maintained accounts, and paid dividends.- Companies owned or subcontracted ships, they had accountants, they employed (directly or indirectly) workers at both ends of the supply chain, and they may had a physical infrastructure. The ships were designed and optimized to carry grain.
- There were also government decrees, which lay out various financial incentives for ship-owners to build their ships to carry grain for Rome.
- The Roman grain corporations also employed a network of agents: local buyers, logistical staff, and overseers.
- Finally, individual grain merchants banded together to form what looks much like a modern-day trade association.
- We can presume that much of the structural and organizational (or cross-organisational) behaviour of the grain merchants was driven by one central concern that we might think no longer has much relevance: the problem of information.

#### INFORMATIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND THE ROMAN MARKET

- No modern communications tech then. Ther was a courier service (_cursus publicus_) that was established, but it was expensive, confined to state use, and was limited to the speed of a horse travelling over the Roman road system.
- Market information existed exclusively in a local context.
- Roman firms had a hierarchical structure to manage operations. The problem though, was the principal agent problem (how do you get agents to act in the interest of the principal as opposed to themselves). Coordinating the buying and selling was hard because of the time/distance problems.
- Key points:

	- Contracts. Binding legal documents.
	- Quality control, weights, measures meant there awas verification throughout the points of the supply chain.
	- Grain merchants had some sort of insurance from the state.
	- There was a paper trail (receipts) throughout the process.

> Given to Didymus by Posidonius, master of eight boats carrying 40,000 artabae20 in the Neaspoleos administration, I have received and had measured out to me the amount ordered by you, in accordance with the order of his excellency the procurator Neaspoleos, from public granaries of the said village at the river Tomis (a specified amount of) wheat, produce of the year (specified), unadulterated, with no admixture of earth or barley, untrodden and sifted, which I will carry to Alexandria and deliver to the officials of the administration safely, free of all risk, and damage by ship. This receipt is valid, there being three copies of it, of which I have issued two to you.21

- How about internal information within the firm? Trust and the freedmen loyalty to the family who they got freedom from. The owner-slave relationship was critical to the best interests of the stakeholder given the available information. The Romans' reputation was used to guard against moral hazard.

#### THE ROLE OF THE STATE

- The state had two focal points that determined its interest and involvement in the grain trade: the army and the metropolis of Rome.
- Three interventions: investment, incentivisation, and distribution.

	- Rome's main port, as Ostia, was rebuilt to accommodate more ships and to increase the dockside storage capacity.
	- Through various decrees, the gov't promoted the construction of larger ships, by granting special tax privileges.
	- The state also recognized the status of grain merchants, who, as I noted above, protected their collective interest by banding together into _collegia_, or associations.
	- By promoting the construction of larger ships, the state also played a role in deferring the upfront capital costs that were needed in order to respond to the city’s and the army’s need for growing supply.
	- Finally, the Roman government was the single largest purchaser of grain. Gov't wheat subsidized 30-40% of the city's population.By the Imperial period, there were almost 300 public bakeries in the city.

- Although it has been pointed out that the scale of private trade was larger than that paid for by the public purse and destined for state granaries, the fact that the state was by far the single biggest player means that it surely had a disproportionate effect on the market environment. State actions like subsidising larger ships, granting monopoly guarantees, providing portside facilities, and setting prices must have played a dominant role in determining the disposition of the market as a whole. Grain was too essential a commodity to be left entirely to free market forces.

#### SEVERAL REMARKS BY WAY OF A CONCLUSION

- The system collapsed in the third century (ca. 250 AD), when the food supply was disrupted and collapsed.
- Once Rome ceased to be the main consumer of available surplus, other parts of the Empire started to expand. 

## 1.1: The Roman Grain Trade: Introduction

What is it about the city of Rome being a million people that should be worth our attention? 

- Transportation. Big challenge.
- Interlinked state with corporate and business interests via policies.
- Size matters because of teh nature and the length of time that Rome was able to sustain that population. That's like half a millenium. We're looking to get to be that optimally efficient.

## 1.2: The Problem of Informaton

It's a, it's essentially a market in which there is a persistent informational uncertainty. There are informational asymmetries, that is to say that parties to transactions in this market have unequal levels of information.

And yet, the market did function, and it functioned spectacularly well, despite not having what we would think of as this enabling condition: enough information to entice capital to enter the market to get it functioning.

How did the Romans manage to generate an optimally efficient or near optimally efficient market absent what we would identify as a core enabling condition, without which we would predict the market couldn't function?

If we can give the market information, we can get that market to function, because a market that has information is a market then, that can function.

Where does the information start in this market? What's the beginning point of information in this market? It's the seed of grain that the farmer plants in the ground. Because that seed carries with it a certain amount of price information, so you know how much it costs to put in the ground and the labor and so on.

So if we start with, does it start, I should add, does it start with the population in Rome that wants bread? Based on that then you know how much bread you need to produce. Okay, so if you don't have the hungry Romans, you don't know how much bread to produce. Well Oh, no, but it's always need that triggers the production. The need that triggers production, where
is the need in our hypothetical market, where does the need start?

So actually, the problem, if we were to think, okay, the information starts with a hungry population in Rome, that actually presupposes the functioning of the market. Problem is we're not there yet, we don't have a market that functions, because we've predicted that a market that doesn't have information cannot actually bring grain to Rome.

So it starts then with the grain that goes in the ground, and the need that attaches to that, which is the need of a farmer, him or herself. And so if the farmer grows the grain and produces enough for himself or herself and adds a little extra supply, at that point, now we have surplus agriculture and it starts to move into the market.

It's already at the point where they, they are the ones who are exchanging information, so the information is the right information. Yeah they have, essentially all of the knowledge that they need, in order to eliminate for potential problems in that transaction, right?

The farmer knows how much he needs to sell the wheat for, the grain for. The person who's collecting it knows how much she is willing to pay, and so, when they come to, when they're parties to that transaction, they have good information, which means that there is transactional efficiency in that information.

And then as the grain moves off the farm into the cart, it carries with it that good information. And as if we imagine simply moving up our supply chain and we'll use the case of Egypt here because it was the one that was in, outlined in the case.

If we follow that supply chain along, at every moment where there is a transaction, so when Georgianna sells it to Antonio sells it to Amaranth and so on, every time they're engaging in a transaction, what is the nature of information in that transaction, good or bad?

Good. Why? Quantity, price, quality. You are not constrained into the transaction. (Different buyers and sellers exist at every point in the supply chain.) Because you assume the risk for your part in the chain, then you have to make sure that your good is of sufficient quality, and it is exactly what's ordered.

Because it's subject to locally competitive forces, if the farmer is asking too much for the grain, you could simply go to another farmer. And if the donkey and cart operation is asking too much, you find somebody else and so the locally competitive forces further reinforce the efficiency of the market and so you have transactional relationships which are characterized by good information in a locally competitive environment, which suggests you have a efficient market indeed, right?

Lastly, what is the problem of the Roman who buys the bread? Price. It can be too expensive because of so many intermediaries. How do you solve the problem of transaction costs?

If the problem of the market is a lack of information, isn't the best way to solve then for the information, to solve for that problem of information, simply to introduce a transactional environment where information is passed efficiently along from person to person to person. But the market can only extend out as far as those transactions costs allow, which in this case might be, who knows, somewhere on the upper Nile.

Beyond that, it's simply too expensive and there is no market. So as we've seen, when we saw for the problem of information in the market, we do so at the expense of unacceptably high transaction costs. Meaning, that the market cannot function, since the cost using the market to move to grain to Rome is simply too high.

The paradox of the market is it doesn't have enough information. We have given the market now the information that it needs, but we have done so with the expense of unacceptability high cost, which means we are now closer to solving the central dilemma: how did the Romans manage to get this market working?

## 1.3: The Problem of Transaction Costs

How did the Romans solve then for this transaction cost problem; what did they do?

Competition. Competition between merchants, and the government was also involved.

So what's the problem we need to solve for now? Drive down transaction costs by competition, through recording the same transaction? One of the ways to do it might be through competition, so you can strain the ability of individual intermediaries to, to overcharge.

So you try and optimize the price mechanism, as we call it. Would that be sufficient, though, given the number of intermediaries that we've pointed out here?

Even if we introduce optimally efficient circumstances in each one of those locally, in those local transactional environments, would that be sufficient to drive down transaction costs enough to let our hungry Roman have his morning bread?

A kind of vertical integration in a way, by creating a company. What do we call vertical integration? A company, a firm.

Why does a firm exist? answer that he came up with, now we call it the Transactional Theory of the Firm. The firm is merely an organizationally efficient response to a market transaction problem.

So, when you have a market, the cost of using it which is high, so there is a high cost of using the market, organizing operations through a firm, coordinating the activities of all those entrepreneurs under the umbrella of the firm allows you systematical to reduce the transactions costs of that market.

It is cheaper to put your donkey and cart man on salary and have him go around and collect the surplus grain, than it is to pay them individually every single time that there's a transaction, simply systematically reduces the cost.

It's a dominant theory, that at a very basic level a firm is merely than an organizational response to a transaction cost problem. And our case in Rome, I think, illustrates that very clearly, 'because that's what the Romans did.

That's why they developed essentially, a firm driven response to using the market. Entrepreneurial driven response to using the market, leads to unacceptably high transaction cost. When you move it to a firm, so that is to say, when you domesticate many of those transactions under the umbrella of a single organization, you create efficiencies. It becomes cheaper and that reduces the overall cost of using the market.

It was estimated that the additional cost of moving grain from, I believe it was Spain to Rome, so that is to say, all of the attendant costs in of, of the supply chain, added only 16% to the cost of the product. Which, if we think about the time period, is a pretty remarkable achievement, to be able to reduce the cost of using the market to only 16% of the value of the good.

So the question then is how were the Romans able to derive a firm driven response. What was it that they had? What could they do that allowed them to use the firm as an efficient response to this market dilemma? And as we know, the problem with a firm is what? What happens, as soon as you have a firm, you may get transactional cost efficiencies, but you get it at the expense of something else. What do we call that?

Bureaucracy. Moral hazard. The divergence of interests between the people who own the company or supply the capital, and the interests of the people who are charged with going out and generating the rents that that capital is seeking. Known in the literature as the principal-agent problem. In very broad way, we might simply say that a firm is merely a principal-agent problem that has been more or less effectively solved.

But it's a very serious problem right, the principal-agent problem? Because if I give somebody a whole bunch of money and I send them out and they go a thousand kilometers away, to act on my behalf, but I have no idea what they're doing, am I likely to lend them money in the first place? Am I likely to capitalize the system in the first place? No.

What makes, what's the precondition for capitalization? Knowing something about the returns your capital is going to generate.

Rome was a city of a million people for 500 years in a persistently informationally uncertain environment. Which means that they must have had a well capitalize market, a well functioning market. How was it that they were able to resolve for the principal-agent problem of the firm, in order to generate the capital that the market needed to function?

## 1.4: Transactions and the Agency Dilemma

How was it that they were able to resolve for the principal agent problem of a firm, in order to generate the capital that the market needed to function? What did they do? They had freedmen agents.

So, we have here, in a sense, an opportunity to consider the firm at a very basic level, which I think, from the point of view is management, is fundamental. Because it's strips so many externalities from the question of the firm. And invites us to think of the firm in a very, in, in the terms of its very pure functioning.

In a modern scenario, if you wanted to see a similar kind of mechanism, let's look at employee stock options. But in the Romans, it was because of teh slavery that enabled the Romans to compensate.

Now, we have loyalty to the firm. And fear, a bit. But reputation. Social inclusion and social exclusion, if you did not respect the moral contract, you had the risk of being socially excluded, and therefore not being able to earn a living.

Stuff such as contracts or inspecting ships were quality controls. Internal mechanisms in firms are governed not by coercive stuff such as QC but by being self-governed. Reputation and trust.

Now, we have emails or weekly reports. They had receipts. Which are super sub-optmal.

Alfred Chandler, said that managerial hierarchies are what make a firm. Without it you just have entrepreneurs in shops. You can't have the firm without the telegraph and the railroad. Until the information can move at the speed of an electron, so that you can monitor people in far far-flung places, the firm is a very unlikely entity to exist.

If you don't have an ability to monitor, why would you erect a firm in the first place? It's simply too much risk for capital. There are other, better ways to generate returns for your capital than entering into a risky organizational proposition like this one.

And yet the Romans were able to do this. They were able to do so in a way that led to optimal, optimal results, optimal market efficiencies. And what did they have? They had, in addition to these other coercive, its extra-organizational institutions, they had this mechanism of reputation.

Which invites us then to focus on the mechanism of reputation, to ask us about the question of incentive since it seems to be, this is what the Roman grain trade tells us, it seems to be fundamental to how firms work.

And what it suggests is well, one of the things we need to think very carefully about is this question of reputation, trust, and incentive. What kinds of reputational, trust, and incentive mechanisms are we putting in place in our organization in order to optimize outcomes?

## 2.1: Weighing the Method

We see a market that is characterized by persistent informational uncertainty. And a market that doesn't have the information that it needs is a market that we would predict cannot function.

The problem is that when we have an entrepreneurial driven market, so in other words when we have individual intermediaries in the market, the result is unacceptably high transaction costs.

The mechanism that we use to control for transaction cost, and I suggested the Coaseian framework from 1937, elegant then, elegant now. Is that a firm, the nature of the firm is simply an organizationally efficient response to a transaction cost problem.

It's cheaper in the end, to use the market by domesting, domesticating those transaction costs, under the umbrella of a single organization. That solves for the cost problems.

Romans had a robust legal frame work, which allows them to sign contracts in triplicate. They also have QC mechanisms. But most importantly, they had a mechanism of slavery. This solved the problem of agency.

The enabling condition for the firm is that you have sufficient velocity of information to enable a hierarchical, managerial structure. That's when firms exist. Romans didn't have this.

How do we control for agency costs, how we, in a management context, talk about
agency.

Forced distribution ranking: Stack/rank, rank/yank. Evaluation periods. Promotions. Alternative career choices. Everyone, including the F 500 and the Big Four, does this. Curved evaluation scheme the forced the forced distribution ranking scheme.

Firms do this for the performance incentive. It keeps from being sued when they fire someone. It is a transparent monitoring scheme.

Because of the constant evaluation, you're always identifying talent and people who are holding you back. Because of the competitive environment, they are motivated to work a little harder.

Does that send a good signal to the cx? Yes, because  "I want to sign a contract with these guys, because they promote that kind of talent, they have that kind of excellence." 

Transparent information flows + knowing the rules of the game + promoting a kind of higher productivity and competitivity amongst your workforce +  sending positive signals to the market means it makes sent to have a curved employee evaluation scheme.

Employees hate this. But while employees feel that this is undue pressue, isn't the firm about optimizing its own outcomes and earning money? If the employees are not happy, then they will make the firm suffer at the end.

Boosting productivity, constantly promoting talent, creating informational transparency, creating informational flows, and sending positive signals to the market. That's or those all sound like pretty good things. And if a firm can achieve those things or something like the forced ranking scheme, they should do it.

## 2.2: FDRS Some Drawback

Where would we expect the primary incentive in the aggregate to be located? To seek promotion? Or to avoid being fired, to avoid termination?

Your Incentives are always going to be selfish. They're not going to be the same as the firm's incentives. Economics teaches us that we are inherently selfish beings only looking out for us, that's true.

You need to not get fired first before you get promoted. And sometimes, by being given a crappy evaluation, you can find good alternatives in life. But people usually hate change. It makes you look bad. It entails reputation risk, and reduces your market value. So the primary motivated will be not to get fired.

This makes people choose low risk decisions. It systematically and structurally disincentives the taking of risk. It diminishes collaboration, because you don't want to be part of the bottom 2, because it's a zero-sum game. You can also reduce the level of output of the company as a whole, because everyone is just working to be better than the two worst. Worst, you can enhance your own position by pushing other people down.

And when talents are clumped, it's a great opportunity to learn, but you have to compete with them. But if you're surrounded by mediocre people, you think you're probably safe this quarter.

A scheme that inherently and necessarily introduces punitive measures would discourage talent clustering. Because it would make essentially the fulfillment of that primary incentive, that primary obligation harder. And so if it makes it harder, you would avoid it. If it's harder to avoid being fired by working under a condition A or a condition B, you're going to avoid it. And that means then that we would predict systemic avoidance of talent clustering in a firm.

## 2.3: Outcomes and Contrasting Evidence

Management needs to control for agency costs within the organization. And no manager wants an environment where people in the firm don't collaborate, have a bare minimum and don't do much more, and are always pissed off.

Why do firms have this scheme (firing)? Jack Welsh (GE) said they have a scheme like that, and he said it's fundamental to our firm's success. They are looking at it from a results-driven perspective. Tons of companies do this, even though the literature hates the concept of employee appraisal.

There are no real world examples that demonstrate optimal firm outcomes using a forced ranked distribution scheme. And even though studies which based on models predict perhaps a boost of productivity in firm performance, find it that boost, of that productivity boost is limited, last maybe a year or two years.

Firms have a network effect: once one firm starts to do it, many firms do it too. But the Roman grain trade case suggests you don't need that kind of coercive monitoring mechanism. Instead you want mechanisms that foster trust and reputation amongst your employees, because that's the best way to align incentives.

If you compare firms that do employ stack and rank like Microsoft, and you put them up against companies that don't, like Google, it's not clear, I think, to any of us, that we're necessarily seeing unambiguous better performance in one than the other.

If we simply do something because it seems like a good idea without considering why it's a good idea from every possible angle, and only implementing it after we have made that consideration, we are not engaging in good management practice. That is an example of management failure. And this is what we need to avoid, this is what firms need to avoid, they need to avoid that kind of failure, and you avoid that kind of failure by coming at the questions, at the problems that you need to solve, in the widest and most informed way possible.

If you simply look at something from the top down, and you forget to consider it from other perspectives, you are unlikely to be able to project all of the potential consequences for the decisions that you're taking. And yet that is the role of a good management.

## 2.4: Concluding Lessons from the Roman Grain Market

And it's worth noting that the Rome that disappears in the third century. When Roman authority is reestablished at the end of the third century, at the beginning of the fourth century, after the reforms of Diocletian, the center of Rome, the Roman empire, is no longer in Rome, in Italy, but rather in Constantinople in what is now Turkey. And the whole system that supported the Roman Metropolis for that period of time never really gets restored.

What might explain how a complex system that's organized itself in such a way so as to be sustainable over a very long period of time. Why would it suddenly fail?

Having witnessed it with our own eyes, we know what it looks like. What is it that the system needs in order to continue functioning? What disappeared September 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed, what disappeared that didn't let the market continue?

Trust. When the market loses confidence it can no longer function.  When the Roman Empire was no longer at peace is partly true that the empire breaks up into three, there's civil war, there's strife and so. So there are these exogenous factors that seems to contribute to the erosion of confidence.

Rome had an increasd military expenditure, because its territory was so big. And Rome was under a fixed gold standard, the only money available to the Roman economy was what they could dig out of the ground in gold and silver. You have expanding military costs and fixed money supply.

First, you try to get taxes. But when you don't have revenue, we just print cash. (The Romans just diluted their gold from 100% to 5%.) So you make money out of nothing. And Roman coinage began to debase over the next 50 years. And there's a tipping point, a moment at which the market simply stops to function.

The reason why the Romans needed to debase their currency in the first place was because of constant growth and expansion. More costs which the state was not able to bear. Now growth is a major benchmark of managerial success today. Why is no or little growth a bad thing to say?  

What kinds of consequences are there for firms operating in an environment where the only benchmark for success is that model of growth? Is that sustainable? Can firms actually generate good long-term outcomes if that's the only benchmark of success that we know? Or should we instead consider offering ourselves the latitude to expand the benchmarks of success?

We see that Rome essentially moves out of an equilibrium and as a result ends up destroyed. Or at least the market ends up destroyed. If it's not good for Rome, it's not good for a firm. Firms need to be able, managers of firms need to be able to identify and then try to achieve equilibrium with their market. And that should be a benchmark of success. And we need to give ourselves that piece of vocabulary back when we think about what good management practice is.

Since the 1930s The average life expectancy of a firm has fallen by more than half. Could it be that the management principles that inform the direction of those firms are no longer serving the interests of the firm itself? And that that divergence of management principle and firm outcome has actually led to the diminution of their life expectancy.

It's a critical question for our general capitalist economy, and it's a critical question that we'll be considering over the rest of this class, indeed.

## 3.1: Innovation

Growth. Value. Competitive advantage. Survival. Companies that can't solve their problems, companies that can't grow, companies that can't retain their competitive advantage are companies that will die.

Improvement or revolutionary? Evolutionary or incremental? Disruptive, or what you know? Random, or deliberate?

Innovation is about the right environment, creating disruptive ideas, in a task-driven environment which is sensitive to the market in order to retain competitive advantage and that's three of 'em.

Or you say, no, no, it's about, randomness and creativity and simplicity, with an acceptance for risk in order to create, development.

Or you say, no, no, no, no, no. It's about, a constant sense of improvement with, giving the freedom to the people that you work with, the idea of rule breaking driven by customer need in order to drive great profits and that's Apple.


__What it tells us is a lot of what we read about innovation is in fact merely the reverse engineering of success stories in the marketplace, which is another way of saying," Do what these guys did and let's call that innovation".__

The limitations of a reverse engineered success tells us, that the concept of innovation itself remains very elusive. We know it's not invention, because it's not called invention. We know it can't just be improvement, because if it were, we would call it

## 3.2: The Box: Explaining its Introduction

Why does it make sense to internationalize, globalize management where in this, in todays world? I think the answer to that is because a global economy needs a global manager.

It's only the rise then of the global economy that we have now the need for an international manager, somebody who can speak a kind of international language of management.

How did the shipping container made the world a smaller place? Why was the, why were the 1950s and the 1960s the right time, the right place, for what is, after all, a very old idea.

The Romans had their own version of the container, the amphori. Why so long before the shipping container?

Random + environment. Random event: The person who came up with the idea. Environment: The shipping industry was in a crisis. They were also looking how to cut the costs and compete in a better way.

We could also look at the competition that existed during this period. Need good transpo system to bring US goods to market in Europe. Labor scarcity? Government intervention?

Trade was also a good diplomatic move. Build close trading relationships, from close economic relationships come strong political friendships.

I think someone from outside the industry has to make the change, because anybody within the industry couldn't, imagine, such a radical change and couldn't, and saw all the problems that could be caused by it.

McLean: Outside perspective, relentlessly focused on cost-cutting, and someone whose capacity or appetite for risk is huge.

## 3.3: The Box: Conditions for Success

He has the ability to take risk, he has the ability to solve problems, he has the ability to look at old problems in a new way.

He just needed money to create an entirely new global infrastructure from the ground up. You need new ports, new infrastructure. We can change the things we don't want (climate change) but we "don't have cash". We know it's not great but, it's good enough.

So, we accept that it's actually just better than to stick with the system that we have rather than expose our self to the tremendous expenditure to change it.

Is this a problem of cost or a problem from seeing the benefits? Politicans, because they want to get re-elected, also don't want to take risks on bond issuances.

Does it create competitive disadvantage this, this market as it existed prior to the introduction of the container. Were firms that needed to ship goods at a competitive disadvantage because of the nature of the marketplace?

It's very expensive to use the market. This creates a demand for change. Labor is expensive, high costs, and there is a chance for theft. The theft means the two firms are not at a competitive advantage to each other because they're both facing the same issues. They also factor the price of shipping the good into the price of the good itself.

If it's expensive to use the market, many goods are simply not going to travel that far and so the market has kind of natural boundaries built around the constraints of using the market itself, which may not be ideal.

There's a definition to my market and one of the constraints, is simply the cost of shipping my goods. And once it gets too expensive, I don't have a market there.

## The Box: The Story of Failure

Costs have always been there. Why not the 40s, 30s, 20s, so on? McLean's great insight was that the business of shipping was moving cargo and not sailing ships. 

Malcom McLean's great insight was that the problem of shipping was the people you needed to move the good from point a to point b. If you get rid of the people, you get rid of the problem.

He didn't really care how you did it. He thought maybe I can drive trucks directly onto ships or whatever. The point being, he was simply looking for a solution that eradicated the people because the people were the problem.

Get rid of the people, you have gotten rid of the problem. What was the problem of the people, these dock workers? If it's not cost, and they'd always introduce high cost, high theft.

What they introduced was not high cost, but far worse, unpredictability. How did they make the market unpredictable? By striking. Work stoppages.

The market in the 1950s and 60s characterized by expanding trade, increasing importance of trade, a market that was looking for more productivity and more predictability, what did it get from the dock worker unions?

Less productivity, less predictability; in other words, the unions gave the market exactly the opposite of what it needed.

And the animating principal of what was new, was let's get rid of this factor, which is provoking the unpredictability.

There's an equally interesting and perhaps a more important story of failure happening here, who failed? The dockworkers, the dockworker unions failed. They failed organizationally. They failed as an institution.

Why did they fail? Because they did not give the market what it needed. When the market was asking for more predictability and more productivity they gave the market less predictability and less productivity and moreover they did so in a local way.

## 3.5: Thinking Beyond Innovation

The unions did not innovate. When you think of innovation, do you think unions? No. The purpose of a union is to secure under the circumstances the best possible condition for its membership, right? That's the purpose of a union.

In the context of a changing environment, what's the best way to deal with that? Adapt. Why then, in the context of managerial culture, don't we have this as our concept for how firms should deal with a dynamic competitive environment?

Why don't we say firms need to learn how to adapt? Why have we substituted innovation over adaptation? Why do we tell firms, no, no, don't forget about adaptation. You need to innovate, innovate to success, innovate to value, innovate to grow, innovate to retain your competitive advantage. Why don't we say adapt?

- Not comfortable, it's not taking the next step forward, but just conforming to the change in society rather thatn being the changer.
- To innovate basically the same thing would mean that you know you are who's in control, you are who's setting these conditions.
- The current managerial culture fails to address a fundamental concern that we have driven into the idea of what good management is. Growth and doing better.
- Innovation prescribes; adaptation is agnostic and it doesn't care.


Sometimes growing is not the right answer. Sometimes looking to grow is not the right answer. Sometimes the best corporate strategy in order to tain, attain long term optimal results is the reverse. Get smaller.

Blackberry: The marketplace has moved on. Not much market left for their devices. BB should say that "we're very good at building enterprise solutions, so let's try and focus on that string." Maybe we'll lose half of our market cap, maybe we'll lose a lot of our market our market presence. But that's where our strengths now exist in this kind of a market place. That's where we should be moving.

Innovation doesn't give you that as a managerial option. Adaptation is a much more powerful tool because of its agnosticism. It doesn't try to prescribe a right answer. It simply says look at your surroundings and do what you need to do in order to optimize your position within those surroundings, and sometimes that means accepting getting smaller, accepting poor results, accepting shrinking profit margins.

It's a Darwinian environment and as the competitive forces get sharper and stronger, some firms simply deserve to succumb to those market forces. That's the purpose of a strategy, to ensure your own survival. 

Instead of innovate or die, adapt or die. Sometimes the right way to adapt, is to innovate. Undoubtedly, but it's not the only way. Some firms want drastic change, or R&D.

What you don't find or only much more rarely are firms that are capable of refashioning themselves, changing their focus to become something else.

And letting go of something even if it means profound altering their size, their profitability and other KPIs that we identified as key to the success.

And that shouldn't surprise us, because in a managerial culture where the only benchmark of success is growth.

It's a failure of management if you can't give yourself the widest range of options in order to secure optimal results for your firm. Which means, we need to change the conversation and we need to think about management in a new way.

Another example of a critical perspective on management that invites us to take the assumptions that we've held and actually challenge the basis upon which we hold them.
