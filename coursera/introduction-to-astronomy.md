## 1.1: Positional Astronomy Introduction

Betelguse, Rigel: East, part of Orion the hunter.

Right "w": Cassiopeia, the queen.

Square: Pegasus.

Vega: Bright star in the south, part of Lyra.

Deneb: Swan.

Capella, Rigel, Aldebaran, Virgo

Most of the constellations are Greek because the pattern in the sky 2000 years ago is the same to what we see today. We can also use this as a geography, the sky has been divided into 88 regions. A star in Orion will be in Orion 100 years from now.

There are more stars in the stripe of the Milky Way.

The fuzzy star in the center of Orion's dagger turns out to be the Orion Nebula (M42).

Pleiades Cluster: 7 bright stars in Taurus that are together.

Globalar Cluster: Cluster of stars in Pegasus.

Fuzzy object: Andromeda Galaxy. 5x the size of the full moon in the sky.

Fuzzy object in Lyra: Ring Nebula.

####Summary:
- On a clear, dark night, we can see as many as 3000 stars.
- We use names and grouping from ancient Greece because the pattern is almost unchanging.
- Yet sky changes by the hour and season.
- Relative positions of the stars do not change, admitting a geography of the sky.
- Entire pattern revolves daily: stars rise in the East across sky to set in the West.

## 1.2: The Celestial Sphere

We rotate from west to east, so it seems that the stars rotate from east to west.

Celestial sphere: We have to find coordinates for where exactly everything is in the sky.
