## 1.1: Introduction: Social Good and Tragedy of the Commons

Garrett Hardin identified a significant gain game theory or economic or formal problem about what happens when people are sharing a resource, but are motivated by self interest.

So when Harden started his work on the Tragedy of the Commons, we are in the mid 1960's, publishes the article in 1968 and for him the overriding issue is population growth. The population problem, he wrote, has no technical solution. It requires a fundamental extension of morality.

So it's not just about more food. It's not just about better transportation. It's not just about controlling waste or pollution, it's about a fundamental extension of morality.

What is the dilemma he identified?  And that this as long as we're motivated by self-interest, that this is going to end up tragically. Because we will, we will destroy the resource that we are competing about.

The competition for resources will destroy the resources as long as there's no regulation on the amount of use of those resources, and Harden thinks that this will require significant changes to how we behave and how we're motivated or how we're regulated, in order to avoid this tragedy.

He quotes William Foster Lloyd. The essence of dramatic tragedy is not unhappiness, Lloyd wrote in the eighteenth century. The essence of tragedy resides in the solemnity of the remorseless working of things. There's nothing we can do about it, we're just, you know, there's no chance of changing, because, because, you often hear in this rhetoric, if even if I change in my country, let's say the United States, another country is dumping all kinds of carbon in it and profiting and developing from it.

Developing countries say to the developed world, well you guys have been dumping stuff into the atmosphere for a hundred years. Now you want us to control it when we need to dump stuff into the atmosphere to have economic development.

While everyone else is profiting, nobody wants to be the fool who stops economic development in order to preserve the atmosphere if everybody else is dumping into the atmosphere anyway.

Hardin goes on here in really prescient ways in this short essay, to talk about how,
almost biologically, we deny this. We deny these things because it's easier to continue going along with our self interests, or what seems to be our self interest than to recognize a long term problem.

Natural selection he writes, favors the forces of psychological denial, because as an individual, if I deny there's a problem I continue to profit as an individual. At least for a while.

It's only when there's a lot more people dumping a lot more stuff or having more and more animals graze in that pasture. Only when it builds up to a critical point does this natural selection towards denial become very, very counter-productive.

The individual, Hardin wrote, benefits as an individual from his ability to deny the truth even though society as a whole, suffers.

It, it's really interesting, I think, the individual benefits as an individual from his ability to deny the truth. And so, as an individual, the product of natural selection we, we tend to deny the long term consequences of our action.

To deal with:

- Only if through private ownership, if somebody owns the pasture, they're going to try to take care of it's long term health. The problem with this is that private owners don't often look at a very, very long time horizon and it's in their individual interest to exploit it before they sell it. And so that may not work so well.
- The second option is some kind of government ownership. Well government ownership can seem
tyrannical, and furthermore government ownership is usually overseen by bureucrats who have no individual's interest in optimizing the performance of the resource they are paid to protect.

And the whole point of Socrates' work in The Republic is to show us that there's a, a, that if we understand our own private good properly, we will also understand that this is a social good. It's a virtue.

And this is one of the themes of this class, is whether there's an inherent tension between self-interest or the, the pursuit of the private good and, and justice and, and the polar good. 

If each person is pursuing his or her own private interest they will have an incentive to discover or learn what other people's interests are, so that they can provide them with goods and services that they will pay them for.

And so, the suggestion that he's making, that's formalized in Adam Smith's idea of the invisible hand, is that by each person pursuing their own interests, they will act in ways that will generate the greatest good for the, for the society as a whole.

## 1.2: Genealogy of the Idea of Social Good

Hobbes supposes that our private goods are inherently conflicting, and they're inherently conflicting because of scarcity. If I want something and you want it, we become enemies. And because we're rational, we can see into the future, and we can recognize that we're going to have needs in the future.

And so, scarcity is augmented by our rationality. If we were not such rational group beings, we'd be like dogs. We'd be, we'd eat our meal, and then we'd fall asleep. Until we got hungry again.

Hobbes

- The goods and things that we want to satisfy our appetites are scarce.
- The scarcity is augmented by this capacity to look forward.
- We all have an inherent desire for what Hobbes calls glory, or status, which is zero sum by definiton.

And Rousseau's critique of Hobbes is to say, look, these kinds of desires aren't hardwired. These kinds of desires are a function of the social world in which we live in. If we live in some kinds of social worlds, we'll develop those kinds of desires, and in those social worlds, there is not much of a common good. Because if your interests are inherently antagonistic.

But in other social worlds where you come to have desires that are compatible with the satisfaction of other people, and therefore no desires that are based upon invidious distinctions of status, then you can have a common good and you can organize the society in accordance with that.

So some societies are organized to promote this pursuit of honor or what Rousseau always
called vanity. And other, and others, could, they could organize, they could be organized differently. Honor and so forth are drives of the people in that society. The societies are likely to be characterized by high levels of competition and violence.

Pinker makes a big point of this in his book on The Better Angels of Our Nature. Pinkers argument is that we, we have moved away from violence, both within domestic societies and at the world level. As a result of the creation of political structures that secure order for large, for large numbers of people and therefore we, people don't have to, as it were, rely on self help to form some defense.

And so we're moving away from the kind of Hobbesian state of nature towards a state of civil order.

I mean to go back to this notion of seeing into the future, you pursue things rationally but our very rationality leads us to tragic conflict. From an individual point of view, I'm inclined to advance my own private good. Since you're inclined to advance your own private good, we could end up actually creating a situation that's worse for both of us even though we're being very, we're rationally pursuing our own private goods.

One pursues one's own self interest, but the result is that everyone is worse off. And we all, and we all spiral down, exactly. And that's the same dynamic that Hobbes thought would characterize the state of nature where we're concerned about security. I want to, to secure myself and so therefore I see you as an, as an enemy and so therefore It makes sense for me to strike first to get you before you can get me.

And for both Hobbs and Hardin, the only way that they could think of of getting out of the situation is to erect a form of authority that will limit our choices and sanction us, coerce us.

So you can't, from that perspective you can't discover or you don't discover the common good, or the social good on your own. It has to be drilled into you, so to speak by a, by a, an outside authority. So it becomes in our own private interest to act in accordance with a rule.

You have a new problem. You, you erect the authority to control this problem and then you hit a new one that the authority then becomes exploited and so forth. The first law of social science is some are, some aren't.


So, and so what we really need to think about is to try to understand the conditions under which spontaneous self-interested behavior generates good outcomes for the group as a whole, and conditions under which it doesn't.

Think about say the way a hunter-gatherer society operates, they treat the land as a commons. They don't actually take physical possession of the territory. They harvest the, the goods and certainly, the food. And that's fine as long as the carrying capacity of the land is greater than the population of hunter gatherers.

John Locke, in the Second Treatise of Government, said that  if we divide up the land, and we move into settled agriculture, the land becomes so much more productive. That we will be able to support a much larger population than we could have supported by treating the land as a commons and we won't degrade it because every individual propriater has an interest in a, as in insuring that the future flow of product from the land will be high.

So by dividing up the common property resource, that's how Harden is using the word commons. By making it, dividing it up into private property you can so increase productivity, says Locke.

Hobbes thought we're going over the carrying capacity of the earth. And he thought that the
solution would be to adopt some kind of authoritative limitations, like in China. You enforce the law with the police. But we can't preach to people and say, you should be responsible, you should practice self restraint, because, those people are be, in effect being being played as chumps.

The article caught on so much, because, perhaps because of this notion that it was our very rationality, the thing we're so proud about, that was leading us to disaster.

Its parallel to thinking that the enlightenment itself is leading to Fascism, or that rationality leads to disaster. I mean, there's a, there's a, I guess, in the post war period, there was almost a critique of rationality with.

I would actually perhaps say it's a critique of instrumental rationality. If you think about say, a Kantian idea of practical reason which involves the idea of finding a rational basis for norms, like the norm of respecting other persons, treating them as ends in themselves.

Kant saw the development of the human capacity for reason as enabling them to grasp moral principles and therefor to learn how to live with one another. And to bring a better situation ultimately of perpetual peace in the world.

The external authority gets internalized.  We have our norms that we conform to because the norms are reasonable, and we restrain ourselves rather than needing the cops.

For people like Rousseau and Kant and people in that tradition we need to recognize that we're imperfectly reasonable and therefore there is slippage.

But the idea, the core idea behind this is the idea of, the question of how could we be free, and live in society with others, because if we're living in society, the society has to have an order.

Otherwise, it's just a deglomeration and if it has an order, then there are rules or norms that we're going to have to conform to in order to bring, to create that order. But if I have to conform to those rules, then how can I be free? And their answer is, well if those rules are rules that, you, yourself will because you see they're reasonable.

So for when Rousseau says freedom or the highest form of freedom is obedience to a law that you give yourself, Harden's saying you'd be irrational, you'd be a chump to give that law to yourself. Because other people are going to be cheating and you're missing out. And worse than that, you'll disappear, unless there's this external authority that's sanctioning things.

#### Critiques

So, we might think about the work of Eleanor Ostrom who won the Nobel Prize. And she did, actually did empirical studies of how social groups manage commons. How farmers living in a relatively semi-arid area for example, managed water resources, and so on, without a centralized system of control and without the police. (The polic is social norms and reciprocity.)

Your failure to conform to those norms will lead your the people that you're cooperating with to withdraw cooperation from you. We can tell whether you're playing by the rules. We already have a normative structure in place. Then, the system can be relatively self-regulating. And we can, because it'll be in your long-term self interest.

Exactly, because the opportunities for reciprocity with others make you so much better off than you would be. It doesn't pay to, to take a one off and deviate then and have people withdraw from you. This is the kind of core idea behind the idea of social capital.

Bob Putnam, you may know his work in Italy, where he compares governmental performance in difference areas of Italy He argues that there are areas of Italy where, the civic engagement and political engagement and the self-organizing activities of people in social groups to provide themselves with various goods.

Beginning in sort of the late middle ages with security and moving forward into the modern period with technology, knowledge, education and so forth. Creates this high level of social capital and high levels of governmental performance in these areas where other areas it created very low levels of civic engagement and low levels of government performance. The irony is, is that the, the areas with the low levels is, of civic culture Were areas that had the pure Hobbsian solution.

The  strong government, doesn't solve the problem, it creates other problems. It tends to break up the one on one relationships among people that generates these webs of interconnectedness and so forth.

In the North where you had these things, you had small proprietorships and you had, artisanal based economies and that sort of thing. Where as in the South, you had large land owners and plantations, well, what we would call today, plantation style agriculture. (Both Italy and the U.S.)

So the North is the bastion of democracy, high levels of social capital and so forth.

## 1.3: Reciprocity and Giving Back to the Commons

So in, in, in, in some ways the a lot depends on where you position reciprocity if you're, in the h squared stream and, and you, you have this self-interested person.

Absolutely, and the problem that Hobbes has, is how do you. It's a kind of a catch-22 proble. If we have a structure here we're there's a social expectations of reciprocity, and people therefore are benefiting from those networks that provide that kind of reciprocity, and the opportunities to engage cooperatively with others and making everybody better off.

Then it's in your self interest to play by the rules in places where you don't have it. Then, how do you get it rolling? And if you don't already have reciprocity, how can you generate trust?

Lewis Hyde really insists on the mistake of trying to separate the ego, or the individual, from systems of reciprocity as a starting point because, because then you're always concerned about how to protect that individual rather than how to nourish an ongoing web of reciprocity that is part of what it means to be human.

And, you know, a kind of concrete example of that is the shift we see in many areas of public policy towards focusing on the incentives that providers are offered for engaging in certain kinds of behavior.

And professional ethics, you know, which people, providers see themselves as having responsibilities to the community. Responsibilities to the profession, that their profession comes with, tied to, a moral good. As an educator is not too measured
by how much the returns I make for it, but rather by my conformity to a certain code of ethics and my realization.

That's the purposes that the profession is defined around and, particularly you think about health is defined around the, i mean the, physicians are defined in terms of the value of health, their lawyers are defined by value of justice.

What do people count as part of their self interest? That's going to be part of their
identity. And that identity isn't just individual, isn't just isolated. We form our identities through comparison of ourselves with others. Through the social interactions that we engage in, and so forth. And this is Benkler's big theme, right, is that, that the mistake we make is to think that we just layer on the social after the core individuality is there. And core individuality as, you just said, core individuality is constructed in relationship and he likes to use the examples in contemporary technology about Wikipedia, for example.

One of his favorite examples is that cooperation can become part of one's ethos and not and it goes all the way down. It's not something that you can just layer on. It's just a part of who you are, in relation to others.

He argues along with many others that are intellectual property laws in this country have become way out of whack. Because by creating these very strong property rights, and ideas, and knowledge, and so on and so forth, they wall people off from each other, and the growth of culture and the growth of knowledge and so on and so forth, is a function of the free flow of ideas and so forth.

The whole idea behind IP laws is that it's supposed to give people the incentive to come up withnew ideas and so on and so forth. But if you push it too far in that
direction, you actually undercut the growth of knowledge.

In this course the you know, we're, we're, we're starting off with this, this, this idea of a social good because it's, and we've chosen themes that are not let me put it this way, particularist. So we're going on next week to talk about, poverty and how to, how to combat it, especially extreme poverty. Then we'll be talking about climate change and then we'll be talking about issues around education, especially education and gender. We want everyone to care about these issues, because they are part of our social being.

There's no way of settling outside of some kind of a systematic structure of authority that well generate rules that everybody will follow. Because, since its in everyone's interest to follow those rules, if everyone else is doing so. If we could develop a structure through which the rules could be agreed.  It's reasonable to think that that structure will be effective, even if there's some free-riding that goes on. These systems of communal management, and or communal participation that preserves resources over time, over long periods of time. That works so well because of the kind of tradition of trust.

A while ago we were talking about the conditions under which people acting individualistically in terms of their own projects and self interests, and I would like to use the words in a broad, things that they care about. can produce optimal outcomes and in situations in which it wont produce optimal outcome.

It's the question of externalities, to the extent that my behavior impacts you in ways that aren't consensual. That you, don't involve your agreeing to any effect. Then the decentralized cancelled approaches are problematic. Ex: Global warming.

But when we think about the ways in which interests are related, rooted in our identities and the way identities are rooted in our social lives. We can see that in addition to these models of decentralized self interested market like things and coordinated kinds of activities either through states, or through association, or communal arrangements.

We also see how people's conceptions of their own good can be more or less tied to social goods. You as, as opposed to a small business person, or a person who's out, out to maximize their household income. You'll, you'll, you'll see your interest differently and then in acting in a self interested way you'll also be acting in the way that promotes the social good because you've incorporated. The social good into your own identity.

We want to  encourage the students to think about very specific, and I would imagine, small scale things they can do that would contribute to the social good. To try to write briefly about that, and what that might be. What kinds of alliances they create, what kind of specific actions they create. That if you will, return something to the commons or, replenish the social good to some extent, and, and I think the, the the first thing we have to do is to have some shared sense of what the facts are.

Measures of subjective well-being go up quite quickly with income. But then after you've escaped poverty it really flattens out. It's also true at the, at the national
level as well. Among countries that are relatively rich, there isn't much correlation between how rich they are and how happy they are.

What's really remarkable is that among the countries that are relatively rich, there is a very high level of correlation between equality and good social outcomes. Over and over and over again, they find that equality is associated with better outcomes for everybody.

By sharing stories and by sharing strategies for dealing with these global challenges, we'll have a sense of participation in a community and, and a sense of mitigating at least trying to mitigate some of the nefarious effects of, of, of inequality, of the depletion of the commons of the perpetuation of on equal access to education, that increasing awareness, and giving people tools for action will give us a sense, perhaps of, of greater well being, but more importantly, of greater capacity to initiate change.

But really, the political is the sphere where we can separate ourselves from what's going on in our society and see how we are interacting in ways that may be producing outcomes that we don't want. And then trying to take that into account and restructure the way we do things so that we can create outcomes that we, that we do want.

And so have more control over our, our lives as, as individuals. But that can only be done cooperatively. 

## 1.4: From legitimate communal regulation to pressures for exploitation 

The great challenge facing us now is to invent the corrective feedbacks that are needed to keep custodians honest, those who are in charge of caring for the resource.  We must find ways to legitimate the needed authority of both the custodians and the feedback mechanisms. How do we know that person allocating the resource is not just being, pursuing his,her own self-interest?

Majority of the scientists say that global warming is real, but some people doubt the legitimacy of their authority, because they are not elected. So they find an authority that is more legitimate.

Hardin says that  the only kind of coercion, he recommends is mutual coercion. Mutually agreed upon by the majority of the people affected. People will actually obey authority when they feel it's been mutually agreed upon. We don't have to enjoy it, such as taxes. But we recognize voluntary taxes even if we know they can favor the conscienceless.

An appeal to conscience, Hardin says, is not enough. We need authority. Now while we do not like the tax collectors, but it is with them that we know we are part of a community.

Hardin quotes Hegel as freedom is the recognition of necessity. But what does freedom mean, Hardin writes. When man mutually agreed to pass laws against robbing, mankind, mankind became more free, in the end. Not less so.

Once you realize that mutually agreed upon regulation, management is the way to go then you are free to pursue other goals, because you know the resource on what you depend is protected by the limitation you have taken on yourself.

The limitation on your freedom you have taken on yourself. That's why he says freedom is the recognition of necessity, freedom is the recognition of necessity, quoting Hegel.

We can think back to the French philosopher just before the French Revolution, Jean-Jacques Rousseau who said that freedom is obedience to a law that you give yourself.

Kant also wrote about freedom as the conforming your will to a universal law. And when you con, when your will is conformed to a law then you know you are free as well as being rational.

What Hardin is adding this mix in political philosophy is the notion that when you take on coercive forces against your own self interest, you escape this tragedy of, of the commons.

Elinor Ostrom talks about farmers who are able to have some of their land in private and some of their land in common. But they watch each other in such a way as that no one takes more than their share. Cooperation.

Yochai Benkler's point is that many of us have assumed that everything is guided by self-interest. Everything, everybody is guided by narrow instrumentalism and always looking out for, just for themselves. And what Benkler says we've discovered, especially through, the modes of cooperation we see online in social media and other places online, we see that cooperation also speaks to a very powerful a natural tendency of human beings.

What Benkler writes about is how the tragedy of the commons can be avoided by tapping into our natural interests in socializing, cooperating, and finding solutions together.

The commons deals with the, the role of the resources that we as humans have, sometimes share or sometimes not share. And so, because of the critical nature of what are happening to these common resources worldwide, and the because of increasing globalization, and looking now at resources in dimensions that we never conceived of before that is, planet wide.

The forest, in the high Amazon has been a commons for the indigenous people. The Peruvian government is giving in concession to multinationals, to oil companies because the ecological devastation is very bad.

So they're taking land that was in the public sphere and privatizing it. Giving it for
temporary 90 years to these multinationals. It got so bad in Peru because 75% of the country was given in concession to multinationals, or private, big private companies. And most of these lands were ancestral indigenous lands, and it came to a head in June of 2009.

Where the Amazonian, indigenous people got together and stopped the main road that carries all the extracted things from the Amazon. And that put pressure and the government eventually decided to send machine guns and helicopters and it was a massacre. It happens in India. It happens in Latin America. It's happening everywhere.

That started I think, I mean, scientific forestry started in the 18th century, but the government, you know, with the nation state. In the 17th century, the birth of the nation state. The focus was very centralized administrative and you needed to have knowledge of land distribution, commands everything. And to calculate what they could get in revenue.

It started happening in France, Germany, and England. The British denuded the forests of India, of course mostly for building railroads, railroad ties. But the idea was then and is still today, basically revenue for the central government.

It's been going on for thousands of years. The whole area of North Africa all the way through the Anatolian Plateau into Greece and Turkey was 1500, 2000 years ago was mature dense forest that was cut down by the people living there.

Right now I think there's a lot of pressure for nations that do not have lots of commercial resources on an international basis to use these products for as sources of international currency.

## 1.5: Fisheries, Forests, and Sustainable Productivity

In Lake Victoria (Uganda and Tanzania), pressure by the government, as well as banks and in private investment, have turned what was once an artisanal fishery into a largely commercial enterprise, where the local fishers are no longer in charge of the resource, or in charge of the operation.

Fish exportation to Europe now provides the greatest source of international revenue. The fishery is bringing more money into those two countries than the fishery ever has.

But at the same time poverty is increasing in the fisher communities, as well as increasing malnutrition. Because to pay off loans and meet bank obligations or whatnot, or just working for people, they can bring none of it home, even the bycatch, because it's sold to the pet industry for food.

What I have witnessed, or what I've learned, about agriculture forestry fisheries, is that once you bring in the market system and the nation state, that's where the trouble begins. I mean they have been very well studied. The Gangetic Plain and fisheries are extremely sustainable for millenia. And all of a sudden, very quickly, in a matter of a few years, it just goes to hell and you have all these problems.

In India, for example, for the last five to ten years, India has been growing excess food. And yet, the rate of malnutrition and people who starve to death is huge, in the multiple millions of people per year. So more money's coming from agriculture, but yet, starvation and malnutrition increase because of both distribution and because people are too poor to buy the food that they once grew themselves. So, let me look at your question about, is, about whether it's human or not.

I think that there's lots of examples of people having unsustainable practices. I think part of being human is like, actually, every other organism on the planet; everything modifies its environment. And I think, this takes the guilt off of us.
How do we come with a fair distribution of equity? It's true that companies are not going to invent new ways of interacting with these resources, in many ways, in a, in a sense, to protect them. A conundrum, for example, is, if we can grow agriculture in a more effective way in the lands that are already committed to agriculture, then we don't have to destroy other types of natural area to increase the crops.

## 1.6: Cultures of Trust

Professor Ostrom really made the strong argument that the tragedy of the commons could be avoided when people manage themselves.

When people manage themselves and they have mutually agreed upon rules and that they have a, a culture of trust. She found real life examples whether they were fishermen or farmers, she found real life examples of communities of trust and mutually agreed-upon rules that persisted for centuries.

And so she studied these real-life examples to extract models from them, as an alternative to the tragedy of the commons. Yochai Benkler says the point is that people more readily followed game norms when they saw these norms as self imposed, when they saw these norms as self imposed or freely chosen.

People are more likely to follow rules when they believe that those, they've made up those rules, or when they've freely chosen them.

Benkler writes, we not only accept our reality, we not only accept our reality, but we also seem to trick ourselves into thinking that whatever the reality is, is what we ourselves might have chosen. In other words, we have a tendency to accept the regulations and then think those are the regulations we give ourselves.

Practicing cooperation creates its own form of social good. He writes finally, although there is enough evidence to suspect that, when it comes to cooperation, practice makes perfect; that by building and engaging in cooperative systems, we increase the baseline level of cooperation throughout society.

There are some things we can enjoy together, and the fact that more of us are enjoying those things does not diminish the quality of the thing we enjoy. When we listen to a song, if I listen to the song by myself it's fine, I love it, I listen to my song, got my buds in, I'm listening to the song. But then I, say I take my ear buds out, I and I play it for you. I play for five friends around. And we all enjoy it.

Louis Hyde: Well a, a very general definition of a commons is that it's, it's a social regime for managing a collectively owned resource. Stuff like a field or a park. This can also be the commons of scientific ideas.

There's a famous critique of the commons which people say well, listen if you open up a field to everybody soon everybody will come and they'll ruin the field. What this misses is the fact that commons traditionally, and this is a category that goes back millennium in probably all societies, commons traditionally have been a place where people collectively figure out how to behave such that the commons will endure and not collapse.

There's a cultural commons, as well as an embodied commons. So my interest in the commons comes out of my interest in gift exchange. We're looking at cultural commons. I think of the cultural commons as this vast store of ideas and works of art and inventions that we've inherited from the past.

And yes, the Internet has fabulously opened up a kind of exchange which, has been a surprise and a delight to all of us. This class is, is a good example of something that is broadcast, as a common property as it were. The problem has been that particularly the old what are called content industries, the film industry, the recording industry, the movie industry and so forth. Which have properties that they own have had kind of a panic attack around the opening up the digital internet, and digital copying that the internet has caused. And you see this particularly in the copyright realm. This is a place where the cultural commons is threatened.

## 1.7: From Copyright to Cooperative Practice

Copyrights used to last 14-28 years, now it's your lifetime + 70, or 95 for a corporation. It is now fairly unlimited. And now everything you make in tangible form automatically is yours to own should you care to do it. Material is taken from the cultural commons and given to private owners.

A second example would be the way that the patent rights have been expanded. In recent years, we've allowed people to patent organisms that they find in hot springs.

And to explain what was at stake one company, named Myriad, owned the right to a piece of the human DNA associated with breast cancer, and therefore they were able to charge higher prices for their tests and limit other people making experiments around this. This is not in the public good. It, it's good if you're a stockholder of Myriad Corporation. It's not it's not in the commons, which is where it should be.

One interesting thing is the United States used to be a pirate nation. For the first 100 years of our existence, we happily took all the books printed in Europe, and gave them to American printers, and let them print them without any permission asked or fees given back to European authors.

Now the shoe is on the other foot, and we would like to export our rules of the road to other countries. 

I think what you've argued that these efforts to convert the commons into private property that can be marketed and, or sold in different ways depletes the reservoir from which we all draw for cultural production, for cultural sustenance.

That in fact sometimes under the rubric of protecting the author or the creator what we'd have is an impoverishment of the reservoir from which we create new literature, new music, new practices.

Part of the assumption here is that to be a lively creative person, it helps to have a lively creative commons around you.

I'm not opposed to a short-term copyright or a short-term patent. I think these are very useful tools of public policy. But the but the balance has been lost. And there are many situations in which the monopoly power that we give to the owners of cultural property has inhibited for further work.

Awareness is the first step. Then maybe two categories of pushback. One would be trying to work with the law. And the other would be trying to work with norms, or customs, or, or principles of best practices.

But another way to do it is, is to simply find practice communities, and have them think about, how does this work best for us? The people who work on the Human Genome, and other genome projects got together once in Bermuda and came up with a set of ground rules for themselves called the Bermuda Principles. And one piece of it, for example, is they agreed that at any research center any place in the world got to a certain level of description of a new piece of genetic information, they would post it on the World Wide Web within 24 hours. And there are computers internationally which consolidate all this data.

So every morning, all over the world, all these scientists are working from the same set of information. And this is not about the law at all. It's just about people saying, look, this is, we need a commons of our ideas if we're going to proceed with this kind of complicated research.

But I have found in this experiment, sharing what, what we know with as many people as possible actually doesn't take away from our ability to make things on campus, or to, to write books and sell them, or to make recordings and sell them. It actually increases our ability to share ideas, and participate in a culture. 

There are cultural goods, there are social goods that the more, the more we share doesn't mean the less anybody will have. We want to be in situations where we can share in things without diminishing the quality of our individual experience, or the quality of our collective experience, and without diminishing the resource itself, right?

So when I listen to music and enjoy it, it doesn't mean there's less music to go around. If I bring too many cows to the pasture, there's less pasture to go around. How can we, can make the pasture more like the music? How can we make our private enjoyments more social in our responsibility, in our pleasure, and in our thinking about their futures.

In our class, we're going to actually turn to some really seemingly intractable problems, and try to understand how by thinking of them in social terms, thinking of them in cooperative terms, we might be able to deal with them more effectively. We start off with poverty, especially in light of aid and philanthropy.
