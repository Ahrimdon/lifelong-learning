[Reference](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/sixreadinghabits)

- Preview/looking around the text before starting to read.
  - Can develop a set of expectations around the scope and the aim of the text.
- Annotate
  - Have an ongoing conversation with yourself while reading.
  - Don't have a highlighter - pen or pencil is better to do more with the text.
  - Mark up stuff with ideas that come to you.
  - "What does this mean?"
- Outline, summarize, analyze
  - Enables you to see the skeleton of an argument: the thesis, the first point and evidence - through the conclusion.
  - Analyzing: what is the writer asserting? What am I being asked to believe or accept?
- Look for repetitions and patterns, hidden biases.
- Contextualize. Consider the text from multiple perspectives.
- Compare and contrast - what is the point of this reading? Has your thinking been altered by this reading?
