## 5.1: From Product-Centric to Customer Centric

#### Review of 3 Axes

* Performance Superiority: Best Product
* Operational Excellence: Keep the cost low.
* Customer Intimacy: How do we get more money on something that actually adds cost?

#### The Product-Centric Approach

For most companies, it's all about making money and maximizing the _net present value_ of the corporation.

The two non-customer centric axes aim to get __high volume__ (performance superiority), __low cost__ (operational excellence). Just ask yourself, will your company scale? Are costs coming down as you deliver more and more of the product?

Market Share: A good indicator of how well you've done, and how well you'll be doing in the future.

Growth: It's not enough to just be doing things effectively, shareholders want to see more and want to see growth. 

You can choose to take your product and bring it to new customers. You can also choose to innovate and get new products and new services or extensions to the current products.

So regardless of how you build things, you want to grow the product, and companies are structured around each of the company's products (product managers, brand managers).

The competitive advantage: __product expertise__ (we are better than everyone else).

* Goal: Best product for customer.
* Main offering: New products.
* Value creation roue: Cutting-edge products, useful features, new applications.
* Pricing: Price to market.
* Structure of organization: Product profit centers, product reviews, and product teams
* Measures/metrics: Number of new products, percentage of revenue from products less than 2 years old, market share
* People
	* Approach to personnel: Power to the people who develop products. Manage creative people through challenges and a deadline.
	* Mental process: __Divergent thinking.__ How many possible uses of this product? We hire people that can think divergently and who can spread the market.
	* Sales bias: On the side of the seller in a transaction
	* Culture: New product culture, open to new ideas and experimentation.

## 5.2 Cracks in the Product-Centric Approach

There are things going on today that weren't happening 15-20 years ago that are causing the product-centric approach a little bit different.

* __Technology-enabled product development (commoditization):__ With technology, things commoditize much more quickly. Companies know that as they launch something new, they have to think of the next product already. In the natural world, every company wants or it thinking monopoly.
* __Technology-eneabled information flow (smart customers):__ Customers are smarter and more savvy so they are aware of more things available to them. It's harder for companies to extract value for the products they deliver.
* __Technology-enabled delivery (retail saturation):__ In the olden days, companies could rely on the fact that no one else had a product like that, or customers won't be aware of other products, or customers won't have access to other products. It's harder to protect yourself from other competing products.
* __Globalization__
* __Deregulation:__ As industries deregulate/fewer monopoly, companies have to stay competitive.
* Customers want __"end to end solutions"__, which may require products/services from multiple vendors.
* Information systems enable __customer data tracking__. Companies have to use the data about their customers to figure out what they're buying.

Example: IBM was very product-centric, but in the 1990s, they learned they can be better as an advisor, but they're making money telling the customer "here's what you should buy".

## 5.3-5.4: Data-Driven Business Models/Direct Marketing

_Harrahs_ had a difficult time competing with companies with more resources. Their rewards program was able to get more data from the customer than other companies. They were able to provide better messages at the right time.

_Tesco_ turned to the data, too. They understood what households bought from them, and what products those households bought. So Tesco knew which customers were most liable to switch to Walmart, and they were able to defend themselves.

The first businesses to be customer-centric were direct marketing companies. Although it has a negative connotation, it's about knowing who your customers are and what they buy, exactly. Stuff such as segmentation and customer lifetime value come from direct marketers. Once we understood which customers are valuable, we can understand where to focus or products on.

Any company that operates on the Internet and can track the customer over time can be a direct marketer.

## 5.5: Which Firms are Customer Centric?

Which of Walmart, Apple, Starbucks, and Nordstrom are customer-centric?

In his book, not one of them are customer-centric.

* __Walmart:__ Terrific firm, but doesn't know anything about the customers. It does not have a loyalty program. They make efforts to understand customers as a whole, not customers individually. Walmart isn't a direct marketing firm, it is about selling products at volume and low cost. They are a product-centric firm.
* __Apple:__ They are the classic superiority firm. They aren't focused on segmentation, but they are focused on leveraging their product expertise.
* __Starbucks:__ At a local level, they are very customer-centric. The barista knows a lot about you if you are a constant customer (through your casual conversations). They are not customer centric at a national level, if you bring your Starbucks card to another place, they don't know who you are. A truly customer-centric company will provide value wherever you go.
* __Nordstrom:__ They sell apparrel. When someone returned tires that they didn't buy at Nordstrom (it doesn't even sell tires), Nordstrom returned the money. This doesn't make sense, but if the customer is expected to have a ton of future value, then you could, and most probably should, give them money lol. Nordstrom treats everyone incredibly well which is sort of a problem because they are missing opportunities on which customers to choose.

Improvements of the companies: Walmart is developing new products to improve themselves on the customer-centric initiative: the scanner app to know what the customers are buying. Apple also is tracking customer data via iTunes music preferences.

## 6.1: What is Customer Centricity

__Customer centricity__ is a strategy that aligns a company's development/delivery of its products/services around the current and future needs of a __select set of customers__ in order to maximize their long-term financial value to the firm.

* _Select set of customers:_ If we are a product-centric firm, it's hard to keep our costs down if we have a select set of customers only.
* _Maximizing their long-term financial value:_ We want to invest in the right amount of customers. Instead of asking a customer to buy things right now, we wait for the long-term benefit.
* _Aligns a company's development and delivery to customers:_ "Here are our really valuable cx, let's come up with something for them! R&D folks, come up with something for them." Fact is, these customers are valuable because they like our products.

Customer centricity requires the company to be willing and able to change its __organizational design__, __performance metrics__, and __employee/distributor incentive structures__ to focus on this long-run value creation/delivery process.

We look not at what customers have been valuable, but what customers will be valuable.

Sales of the month people are backward-looking. You're incentivizing people to rush sales in order to get their bonuses. Ideally, we'd like the company lifetime value of each customer. We want to not check how much a customer bought. We want to see how much we've improved their value, or how far we took the relationship.

If airlines would be really forward-looking, they'd realize that MBA students would take a temporary hit on their travel, but after that hit, they'd travel even more!

## 6.2/6.3: Living in a Customer-Centric World/More Reflections on Customer Centricity

Remember the over-arching objective: to maximize shareholder value. Remember though that we can't just rely on product-centricity to get more money.

What we celebrate is __customer heterogeneity:__ distinguish the profitable customers from the less profitable ones.

While at first it was a nuisance, with time we realize that customers are really, really different from each other.

Understand that success arises through enhanced customer acquisition, retention, and development.

As we start figuring out which customers have to be kept, and which customers can be better customers, and which customers can be let go.

P&G: Their customer is the retailer right now, but they understand that at some point, their customers will be us. In their "My Black is Beautiful" campaign, they are trying to position themselves as a trusted advisor (music, a specific product line, Queen Latifah).

We want to have relationship expertise!

Re: Finding the right customers. Understand that customer centricity does NOT suggest that "non-focal" customers should be ignored, to the contrary, it is important to have a health proportion of such customers to add a high degree of stability and robustness to the overall customer base.

There is a __paradox of customer centricity:__ the more that a firm tightens its central focus on a select group of customers, the more it needs its "non-focal" customers to stabilize the overall mix.

## 6.4: Questions on Customer Centricity

__Who is the customer?__ In pharmacy, you can argue that the person, the hospital, or the insurance is the customer. We want to agree that one of these entities is the customer, but one customer matters more than others.

__What are the major barriers to account for?__ There might be logistics or cultural reasons.

__What resources can you utilize to preempt the barriers?__

__Thoughts about what competitiors are doing in this area?__ In many cases, the best case to move this is "hey, no one is doing this, let's do it!"

Does it make sense for your organization to become customer centric? If so, when?

## 7.1: How Can Customer Centricity Be Profitable?

The traditional product-centric model is showing some cracks: commoditization, well-informed customers, globalization, etc.

Cx centricity celebrates cx heterogeneity: we celebrate the differences of cx. We judge cx based on what they are worth to us.

We have to beg good in: customer acquisition, retention , and development. The common split is: 5% acquisition, 47% retention, and 47% development.

#### Customer Acquisition

_What metric is used by most firms to gauge and guide their acquisition activities?_

__CPA (cost per acquisition).__ It's very easy to track nowadays. But focusing your business to use this as your main metric is a __big mistake__.

We want to think of our customers as assets, and they are the most important assets that we have. When it comes to other assets, such as lawyers or technology, we use the mentality of not the best, but the skill.

What we want is __value per acquisition__. We think of the upside of each custoemr, and we used that to drive CPA.

People should use the CLV (customer lifetime value) as a seal on the maximum amount you spend to get a customer. With this, we can allocate how much profit we could build to our stakeholders. We want to not spend a ton more, but we want to get more valuable customers.

Customers acquired through Google on average have a higher lifetime value (mean $1K) than cx acquired through different channels. Instead of penny pinching per customer and per click, we shoudld orient ourselves to the value rather than the cost (the difference is so high anyway).

##### Customer Acquisition Summary
- Don't be in a CPA mentality (focus on ceilings instead of floors).
- Celebrate heterogeneity by using CLV to drive acquisition strategies.

## 7.2 Customer Retention

_What metric is used by most firms to gauge and guide their acquisition activities?_

__Churn/attrition rate (retention rate). What percent of our customers stayed with us?__

This is a good metric, but you need to examine it at a closer level. How do companies manage their attrition rates? Ex: Vodafone. Their attrition rate is roughly 20%.
