# 5.1: From Product-Centric to Customer Centric

## Review of 3 Axes

* Performance Superiority: Best Product
* Operational Excellence: Keep the cost low.
* Customer Intimacy: How do we get more money on something that actually adds cost?

# The Product-Centric Approach

For most companies, it's all about making money and maximizing the _net present value_ of the corporation.

The two non-customer centric axes aim to get high volume (superior), low cost (operational excellence). Just ask yourself, will your company scale? Are costs coming down as you deliver more and more of the product?

Market Share: A good indicator of how well you've done, and how well you'll be doing in the future.

Growth: It's not enough to just be doing things effectively, shareholders want to see more and want to see growth. 

You can choose to take your product and bring it to new customers. You can also choose to innovate and get new products and new services or extensions to the current products.

So regardless of how you build things, you want to grow the product, and companies are structured around each of the company's products (product managers, brand managers).

The competitive advantage: product expertise.
