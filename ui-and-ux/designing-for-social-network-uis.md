Dashboard
•	Single Page Graphically Oriented
•	No Scrolling. Nothing Hidden. Linked Content.
•	Graphical: Displays patterns, abstracts data, minimal grids.
•	Guided analytics: Domain aware, leverages knowledge.
•	Grids: Keep it square-ish, comparisons are done by column.
•	Icons: Notoriously ineffective as labels. Use icons + labels always.
•	Access to Supporting Details
•	Highlight Exceptions
•	Outliers should POP out. Color, size, shape, boldness, position, icons.
•	Use color sparingly: General soft colors. Use a single hue, and remember that 7% of all men are color blind.
•	Key Data in Context
•	Charts
•	Line charts to visualize time
•	Bar charts for comparison oriented
•	Pie charts = not that good
•	Maps are great for demographics/demonstrations
•	Gauges suck, diagrams are underrated (process diagram, fishbone diagram).
•	Encourage comparisons, show data in several perspectives.
•	Screen layouts
•	Size = implied importance
•	Uniform otherwise.
•	Top left = primary focus
•	Bottom right = supporting detail
•	Off page = irrelevant
•	Navigation Framework
•	A tiered set of dashboards 
 
Social Network Design
•	Landing: What is it for?
•	Give visitors something to do, right off the bat.
•	Promote interesting content from friends, show them what the friends are doing
•	Make it easier to find friends, leverage email, school, company, name.
•	Let users express themselves through their profile pages.
•	Be dynamic: have regularly-changing content.
•	Update content in real-time.
•	Allow friends to be grouped, let users define groups, create automatic groups, open API to others using OpenSocial
•	Don’t overwhelm your users, and give them the ability to filter.
•	Include user groups and provide a member directory.
