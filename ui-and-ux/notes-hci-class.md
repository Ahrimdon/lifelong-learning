1.1 – HCI
HCI: Design, implementation, and evaluation of user interfaces
•	Real-world design is iterative, fail often
•	Good design can impact individuals ability to be happy
Bad design costs lives, money, & time: medicine, aviation, nuclear
•	Basic principles: Consistency, feedback
•	Ugly design wastes our time. 
•	When an interface becomes automatic, our attention moves from navigating the interface to doing the task itself.
•	It's easy to learn it!
Design for people
•	People's tasks, goals, and values drive development
•	Work with users throughout the process
•	Assess decisions from the vantag point of users, their work, and their environment
•	Pay attention to people's abilities and situation
•	Talk to the actual experts. Users are just one of the stakeholders.
To learn more
•	HCI classes
•	Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things
•	Design conferences
1.2 – The Power of Prototyping
This is the best idea that I want you to get from this class
•	Prototyping grounds communication
•	We are able to gain insights we may otherwise not have
•	The goal is not the artifact, but the feedback
•	It's a question rendered as an artifact.
•	The role of the prototype is to serve as a common ground for people.
Prototype vs final (digital camera)
•	In order to build a version more quickly, the prototype was bigger (they weren't able to miniaturize it)
•	You can't take pictures lol
Prototyping is a strategy for efficiently dealing with things that are hard to predict
•	For "known unknowns": I know I have a problem here
•	"Unknown unknowns": Just stuff you don't know
•	Think sketching before painting.
•	Don't think that you can wing it: People are notoriously bad at determining outcomes.
•	For any complex system, the interactions of all these ingredients far dominate the things that you can easily predict.
Focus 
•	Focus on the goals of the design vs evolving the designs.
•	Instead of having a concrete thing to argue for, thing of what you want to achieve regarding this!
•	The kinds of alternatives you consider at the design process alternate between a lot of ideas versus few ideas.
•	Palm Pilot: Jeff Hawkins created a block of wood, and he would use this block of wood as if it was a real thing. They were able to learn about the form factor.
The rights of a prototype
•	Should not be required to be complete
•	Should be easy to change
•	Gets to retire
What do Prototypes Prototype?
•	Feel (what might it look like)
•	Implementation (what might it work like)
•	Role (what might the experience be like)
Start of prototyping
•	What we want to do is to have a lot of learning in the first prototype (without sinking a lot of time in).
 
•	Example of a big-ass prototype (a plane that isn't really a plane)
•	Apple: Did a big-ass prototype of the Apple store, they were able to make this theory that they can structure the store according to activities (such as music)that customers wanted to do as opposed to the products that were being sold.
•	"The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas." –Linus Pauling
•	IDEO made a hundred prototypes for Microsoft when they made the mouse.
Cost of change over time?
•	Physical products and shipped software costs increase when you try to make changes
•	Shipped software also takes a long time
•	SaaS, while easier to change, irritate people who are used to the previous interface.
Prototypes are questions. Ask lots of them.
1.3 – Evaluating Designs
•	How can we measure success?
•	Why evaluate designs with people? Designers know too much about the UI and too few about their users.
Usability studies
•	Usability studies: Watching people use the interface. This is SUPER EFFECTIVE.
•	Limitations
•	Setting is not as valid as your lab, especially for stuff that you use on the go.
•	People want to be nicer to you when they rate your design so ratings are biased.
•	When there is just one UI, there's no comparison.
•	People need to be brought to your physical location.
Surveys & Focus Groups
•	Limitations
•	People have a difference between what they say and what they do.
•	Focus groups
•	People might just say nice things or say irrelevant stuff
Feedback from Experts
•	Peer critique
•	Dogfooding: Use your own tools
•	Heuristic Evaluation: Structured format
 
Others
•	Comparative Experiments
•	Have an advantage over surveys because you are able to see what exactly happens
•	Better than usability studies because more than 1
•	Participant Observation
•	Simulation & Formal Models
Issues to consider:
•	Reliability/precision
•	Generalizability
•	Realism
•	Comparison
•	Work involved
1.4 – The Birth of HCI
•	1945: "As We May Think" by Bush. They are asking, what can government-funded scientists do to make life easier for humans in piece time.
•	Bush's Memex
•	All of the world's information was on a knowledge worker's desktop. (Internet)
•	Key is UI, information storage/retrieval. (Computer)
•	People can author trails through this information store, save for later use, and share it with others. (Hyperlink)
•	He imagined that you'd wear a camera and use it to capture stuff.	(Camera phone)
•	ENIAC and Grace Hopper's compiler
•	The GUI
•	User's input is performed directly on top of the system's output.
•	Input-output directness makes things more intuitive.
•	Mouse and hypertext
•	1945: Doug Engelbart. "The idea of a device that can extend the power of the human mind"
•	1968 demo mouse (2 wheels that provided 5 inches of motion)
•	Alan Kay: Wants a personal computer. Xerox PARC: prototype of Dynabook. 
•	1981 Star computing system. BMP display, Window-based GUI, icons, folders, mice, Ethernet, Email.
The Long Nose of Innovation
•	Good ideas are clunky early on and there's a long time before things get adopted
 
2.1 – Participant Observation
•	We'll be able to step in someone else's shoes
Truckers in Houston
•	Big hands+gloves so they can't use the interface
•	They replaced the interface to have big buttons
•	"You can observe a lot just by watching" –Yogi Berra
•	Participant observation was inspired by anthropology. Tacit knowledge: Deep hanging out
Questions
•	What do people do now?
•	What values and goals do people have?
•	How are these particular activities embedded in a larger ecology?
•	Similarities and differences across people
•	Other types of context, like time of day
Process vs Practice
•	The most effective was the one who was there the longest
•	The second most effective was not the one who was there the second longest, but the one who was beside the one who was there the longest
Apprentice
•	Set up a partnership with the people to be observed
•	Be taught the steps in the process
•	Observe all of the practices
•	Validate what you are observing with those observed as you go along
Pay attention to all the artifacts. Look for workarounds and hacks.
•	Leave notes and stuff. Look for errors.
Are users just "dumb"?
•	Most probably they aren't (Xerox machine where two research scientists have a problem making it work)
Don't check what people say but check what people do.
Don't ask leading questions
 
2.2 – Interviewing
Choosing Participants
•	Get people who are representative of target users
•	May be current users of a similar system
•	Might also be the non-users
Recruiting Participants
•	Get a diverse set of stakeholders
•	Use incentives and motivation (gift certificates)
•	Approximating is better than nothing
The Importance of Being Curious
•	The more mundane the domain, the more creative you need to be
•	Gladwell: "The trick to finding ideas is to convince that every thing has a story to tell. Figure out the difference between power and knowledge. People in the middle are the people who do things."
What are Bad Questions?
•	"Is the daily update an important feature to you?"
•	Most people would say yes (it's kind of a leading question). People, when asked "is this important?", say yes.
•	Participant observation and log files might actually help you more here. 
•	Better: "I see from the log file that you haven't used the daily update. Why haven't you?"
•	The more open-ended, the better.
•	"Would you like stores with less clutter?"
•	People, once again, would say, yes, they want. But is that what they really want?
•	"What would you like in a tool?"
•	Users are experts in their lives, not in design. People may not know what to say. "If I ask people what they wanted, in the age of the horse and buggy, what they'd say they wanted, was a faster horse." Designers see the car, but users may not know about that.
•	Ask people about their lives.
Other Types of Questions to Avoid
•	What they would do in a hypothetical scenario: too broad
•	How often they do things: People overestimate. Make it concrete. Instead of "how much do you exercise in a typical week", ask, "how much did you exercise last week"?
•	Don't ask them "how much they like things on an absolute scale"?
•	Avoid binary questions. They don't add.
 
Good Questions
•	Open-ended. 
•	Silence is golden. Wait a little longer before giving your answer.
2.3 – Additional Needfinding Strategies
Diary Studies
•	Give people a diary that they complete at a specified time or interval
•	Structured task
•	Can use journals, cameras, voice, video
•	Tailor the recording to the context
•	Diaries can scale better than direct observation. Direct = limited to the time of the study itself
•	Try easier tools so that you can get better results.
Experience Sampling
•	Beeping people at a random interval and ask them something
•	Paper would be the most ubiquitous tools for writing stuff down
Lead users
•	Strong users which have ideas.
•	Sometimes lead users create custom solutions when no commercial solutions available. This worked for things such as bikes and surfboards
•	Lead users aren't that good for things such as process models and factories etc.
 
 
Extreme Users
•	People who get far more often than ordinary people
•	Interesting professions, technophiles, technophobes
•	Sometimes, extreme users are extreme because they're not the average users
•	Keep your users in mind in the design process.
Personas
•	Create abstract users when you  check out who you're using for.
•	Include demographic information about them.
•	Draw a picture or use a photo of your persona, give a name, occupation, a story to tell.
Ultimately, it's the design! These tools just help you!
2.4 – Creating Design Goals
Herb Simon and the Ant
•	An ant's behavior looks complex, but the complexity is mostly in the environment. Changing the environment transforms existing situations into (hopefully) preferable ones.
All design is redesign. Everything that we do has been already done in one way, shape, or form.
•	Find things that are in your existing analog.
•	People across the world have different examples for designs.
•	When you are designing, what matters? What should it accomplish?
•	Estimate whether different designs are meaningfully different.
You're doing this already
•	Implicitly, design includes activity analysis
•	We leap to just one solution (ego ego ego)
Making goals explicit
•	Gives you a conceptual representation
•	This increases your mindfullness as a designer
•	Having a conceptual representation makes it easier for you to take smaller leaps rather than big ones.
 
The outcome of activity analysis
•	What are the steps?
•	What are the artifacts?
•	What are the goals of the system?
•	What are the pain points?
Example: Using a car
•	Steps: Unlock driver's door, take a seat behind the wheel, insert key in ignition...
•	Artifacts: Key, car
•	Goals (what happens when you use a car): Literally, turn on the car. Others: "pick up bread", "make a meal", "have a satisfying evening"
•	Pain points: Narrow = Do I need to put the key in? Wide = Do I need to use the car or maybe the bakery can send the bread to me.
What our objective is
•	Make things more compatible with the users and have a consistency of presentation
•	Are the things that your interface is designing for something that users actually do?
•	Activities can and do change over time, but can we build tech that can create a consistent evolution?
•	Activity analysis is easiset for workflows and repeated activities.
3.1 – Paper Prototypes and Mockups
Outline
•	LifeAlyze: Storyboarding shit
•	Tip in drawing: Star people
Storyboards should Convey
•	Setting: People involved, environment, task being accomplished
•	Sequence: Steps involved, what leads someone to use the app, what task is being illustrated
•	Satisfaction: What motivates people to use this system, what does it enable people to accomplish, what need does the system fill
Benefits
•	Holistic focus: Helps emphasize how an interface accomplishes a task
•	Avoids commitment to a particular user interface
•	Helps get all the stakeholders on the same page
Time Limits Help! Prototype things faster so you can show things to others immediately!
Tips
•	Keep all your materials in one place
•	Work quickly and make reusable components
•	If something is difficult to simulate have the user ask if it is available
•	Backgrounds can be useful to contain the prototype and provide context for the user
•	Don't be afraid to mix and match hardware and software
•	When appropriate, show the context of stuff
•	Other people can modify your prototype if you need to.
Further Readings
 
3.2 – Faking It – The Wizard of Oz
•	We can simulate machine behavior with human operators behind the scenes.
•	Make an interactive application without much code
•	Front end interface
•	Remote wizard controls the UI.
•	Makes sense when its faster/cheaper/easier than making the real thing
•	Get feedback from users people
•	Hi-fidelity: users think it's more real
•	Low-fidelity: more license to suggest changes. This is better at first.
Making a Wizard-Powered Prototype
•	Map out scenarios and application flow
•	Put together interface skeletons
•	Develop "hooks" for wizard input (where will you go in)
•	Where and how the wizard will provide input
•	Rehearse the wizard role with a colleague.
Running W Prototypes
•	Practice with a friend first
•	Two roles: facilitator and wizard.
•	Facilitator provides tasks
•	Wizard operates interface
•	Think of how feedback would work: Think aloud, retrospective, heuristic evaluation
Advantages
•	Fast, don't need to create the algo already
•	More real than paper prototyping
•	Identifies bugs and problems with current design
•	Places the user at the center of development
•	By playing wizard, designers can learn
Disadvantages
•	Simulations may misrepresent otherwise/imperfect tech
•	Wizards require training and can be inconsistent
•	Some features are difficult and impossible to simulate effectively
 
3.3 – Faking It – Video Prototyping
Benefits
•	Cheap and fast
•	Great communication tools/ can serve as a spec for developers
•	Ties interface designs to tasks
•	Aligns and orients interface choices, makes sure you have a complete interface, with nothing extra
What should be there?
•	Like a storyboard, the whole task, including motivation and success
•	Draw on tasks you've observed
•	Illustrate important tasks your system enables
•	Can help scope a minimum-viable-product
•	Changes what design teams argue about (in a good way)
Steps
•	Start with a storyboard (or be random)
•	Equipment: camera, people, realistic locations
•	Focus on the message more than the production values
Considerations
•	Can use audio or silent movie style with title cards
•	Interface can be paper mock-ups code, or invisible
•	Can show both success and failure
•	Edit as little as possible.
3.4 – Creating and Comparing Alternatives
•	Quantity v. Quality?
"While the quantity group was busily churning out piles of work– and learning from their mistakes–the quality group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay".
Bayes and Orland, 2001
•	Participants pick their concept early. This is called functional fixation (Daniel Pink problem).
•	Serial prototyping or parallel prototyping?
•	Better results for parallel conditioning (more clicks and "more designs")
Parallel and multiple alternatives mean separating ego from the artifacts.
Sharing multiple designs (benefits)
•	Increase in group rapport
•	More individual exploration
•	More feature sharing
•	Better consensus
 
4.1 – Heuristic Evaluation
Multiple ways to evaluate
•	Empirical: Assess with real users
•	Formal: Models and formulas to calculate measures
•	Automated: Software measures
•	Critique: Expertise and heuristic feedback
When to get design critique?
•	Before user testing. Don't waste users on the small stuff. Critique can identify minor issues that can be resolved before testing, allowing users to focus on the big issues.
•	Before redesigning. Critique can help you learn what works and what should change.
•	When you know there are problems, but you need evidence. Peer critique can give the evidence structure.
•	Before release. Smoothing out the rough edges.
Heuristic Evaluation
•	Developed by Nielsen
•	Small set (3-5) of evaluators examine UI
•	Independently check for compliance with usability principles ("heuristics")
•	Different evaluators will find different problems
•	Evaluators only communicate afterwards, and findings are then aggregated
•	Can perform on working UI or sketches.
Nielsen's Ten Heuristics
•	Visibility of System Status
•	Match between System & World
•	User Control & Freedom
•	Consistency & Standards
•	Error Prevention
•	Recognition Rather than Recall
•	Flexibility & Efficiency of Use
•	Aesthetic & Minimalist Deisgn
•	Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover From Errors
•	Help & Documentation
Evaluators' Process
•	Step through design several times
•	They can keep in mind the different principles (example is Nielsen's heuristics)
•	Use violations to redesign/fix problems
Heuristic Evaluation: Cost-effective
•	Single evaluator: 35%, 5 evaluators: ~75%
•	Right number of evaluators: about 3-5
•	1-2 hours per evaluator
•	By definition, user testing is more accurate: HEs may miss problems & find "false positives"
•	Better to use diferent methods, but HEs first to weed out stuff
Phases
•	Pre-evaluation training: give evaluators needed domain knowledge and information on the scenario.
•	Evaluation: individuals evaluate and then aggregate results.
•	Severity rating: determine how severe each problem is (priority).
•	Debriefing: Reviewing with the design team.
How-to: Heuristic Evaluation
•	At least two passes for each evaluator
•	If a system is walk-up-and-use, don't assist the evaluators. Be realistic with your evaluators.
•	Each evaluator produces a list of problems. They should explain why this is a problem (they can't say "I don't like it"). List each problem separately.
•	By listing things separately, we don't get to list stuff which doesn't matter
•	Where are problems found?
•	Single location in UI
•	Two or more locations that need to be compared
•	Problem with overall structure
•	Something is missing? Clarify with user if it's not yet there or if it's really missing.
Severity Rating
•	Independently estimate after review
•	Allocate resources to fix problems
•	Estimate need for more usability efforts
•	Severity combines
•	Frequency, impact, persistence
Try this rating by Nielsen
0: Not really a usability problem
1: Cosmetic problem
2: Minor usability problem
3: Major usability problem; important to fix
4: Usability catastrophe; imperative to fix
 
Severity Ratings Example
 
Debriefing
•	Conduct this with everyone (evaluators, observers, development team members)
•	Discuss general characteristics of UI
•	Suggest potential improvements to address usability problems
•	Dev team rates effort to fix
•	Brainstorm solutions
 
4.2 – Design Heuristics Part 1
Ten Heuristics Modified
•	Show System Status
•	Familiar metaphors & language
•	Control & freedom
•	Consistency
•	Error prevention
•	Recognition over recall
•	Flexibility & efficiency 
•	Aesthetic & minimalist deisgn
•	Recognize, diagnose, & recover from errors
•	Help
Show System status
•	You have to do this!
•	Feedback depends on response time.
•	< 1 second: Just show outcome
•	~ 1 second: Spinning ball
•	>> 1 second: Show the fractional progress in time.
•	Show: Space (how much space is left)
•	Show: Change (You've changed this document! Do you want to save?)
•	Show: Action (Red means stop, green means go. Red = on top, green = on bottom)
•	Show: Next steps (This is what is going to happen.)
•	Show Completion: Ok!
Familiar Metaphors & Language
•	Follow conventions both in the online world and real world.
•	Example: Print Preview, we see what gets cropped etc.
•	Example: GUI brings real-life things such as "Trash" and "Desktop" to life.
•	Use familiar language! (Use "email" instead of "electronic correspondence", and don't put some random fine print lol, how about "we're unable to send you email, because...")
•	Familiar choices example: Document encoding mismatch re: character sets in documents; some users may not know what document encoding to use.
User control & freedom
•	Make sure that the user control and freedom is appropriate for the task.
•	"Wizard" at the start, then you can let go if you don't want it anymore.
•	Where the fuck is the "Back" button?
•	Freedom to explore. Example: Airline booking preview of prices.
Consistent Layout
 
•	Consistent names: Think of the user's conceptual model and not of what the business's conceptual model is! When you're familiar with your designs, you have a tendency to use your own terminologies and parlance.
•	At this point you have to ask the people what terms they use. You can also use the "other" option.
•	Make clearer choices: we can replace "yes, no, cancel" with other words such as "keep extension, change extension"
Error Prevention
•	Prevent data loss.
•	Prevent duplicates. If you can detect duplicate documents that is good, but the problem  here is that does the program know what a duplicate is?
•	Prevent Confusing Flow: Follow conventions!
•	Preventing bad input: GUI vs Terminal
•	Prevent Unnecessary Constraints: Example: Searching doesn't need to require a catalog to get started, right? At least given some results first.
 
4.3 – Design Heuristics Part 2
Recognition over recall
•	Ävoid random codes! Can't you just write the thing itself?
•	Avoid extra hurdles. Set up reasonable defaults.
•	Recognition with previews. Think of design tools where you can see the templates.
Flexibility & efficiency
•	Keyboard shortcuts for experts.
•	Defaults with options. Example: Common cities placed in an Airline reservation.
•	Ambient information: Calendar + weather forecast.
•	Proactivity: Instead of just reporting spam, you can also unsubscribe. We have to know what the secondary acts are so we can make good proactive programs.
•	Recommendations: these help a lot.
•	Keep it relevant. Example: remote controls with too much stuff in them.
Aesthetic & Minimalistic Design
•	Above the fold: Put core information above the fold.
•	Signal-to-noise: Use color when necessary and with a purpose
•	Don't be redundant with screen real estate
•	Think, is this website something that people will look at every year?
Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover from Errors
•	Make the problem clear and tell the user which parts were forgotten.
•	Provide a solution. Example: "There's not enough space". Why not tell the user what they can delete or something so that they would have additional space.
•	Show a path forward so the user can fix it.
•	Propose an alternative. If there are too many constraints that were enterred by a user, then find a way to relax the constraints on the page itself.
•	Recognize errors
Help
•	Help learning with examples. Example: PHP web site.
•	Help choicses with examples.
•	Help guide the way for the users. Computer should probably provide a reasonable way so user can solve stuff.
•	Tooltips which help users are really good.
•	Help provide more information. Example: If users are unsubscribing because they have too many e-mails, maybe offer sending less emails (but they still receive)?
•	Help should be sincere. EULAs: can we at least see the important parts?
•	Help people have fun! Filling out forms suck, make it fun. :)
 
5.1—Direct Manipulation
•	What makes a user interface easy, hard, or "natural"?
•	Measuring cup—people would complain about it being too hot, or the handle having a problem, but people needed to periodically check the level of liquid every time they fill stuff up. They created a measuring cup that allowed people to see the liquid levels from the inside.
 
•	Things that can be improved: It doesn't look like something that can be put in the kitchen, you have to tilt your head. 
•	Improvements were made and the numbers are readable from the reader's perspective. You can see ounces when holding with your right hand and milliliters when holding with your left.
 
•	We want to improve the measuring cup in every step of the way.
•	"If I asked what people wanted, they would probably say a faster horse."
Things To Learn From This
•	Simply asking what people want could make you miss opportunities.
•	You can find these problems by going out in the field and seeing what people do.
•	You can get extra power by bringing prototypes along with you.
•	The world is full of people tinkering in theri garage and everyone wins when we start bringing these things out into the world
UIs are measuring cups.
•	Action->Evaluating the outcome
•	We have opportunities to improve these two steps.
•	Action—gulf of execution. How does the user know what to do?
•	Evaluation—gulf of evaluation. How does the user know what happened?
Six powerful questions to ascertain what problems may arise
How easily can someone...
•	Determine the function of the device?
•	Tell what actions are possible?
•	Determine mapping from intention to physical movement?
•	Perform the action?
•	Tell what state the system is in/if its in the desired state?
•	Determine mapping from system state to interpretation?
To reduce the gulfs, provide...
•	Visibility (perceived affordances or signifiers). If they see it then it's easier to 
•	Feedback
•	Consistency (also known as standards)
•	Non-destructive operations (hence the importance of undo). This allows people to explore stuff.
•	Discoverability: All operations can be discovered by a systematic exploration of the menus.One thing someone does when at a new option is to roll over the different menus to see what they can do.
•	Reliability. Operations should work. Period. And events should not happen randomly. This is easier said than done but most interfaces have this category.
Command Line vs GUI
•	GUI: Continuous feedback and you point stuff. This shows the power of direct manipulation.
•	Immediate feedback on actions
•	Continuous representations of objects
•	Leverage metaphor
•	CLI is generally easier to use.
•	CLI: You have to remember the syntax and there is little feedback (no confirmation). CLI is useful when the indirection is a benefit and not a drawback.
•	The CLI gives you power when you can express stuff more abstractly, and thereby do work more efficiently.
•	Ex: Moving files based on patterns.
•	GUIs take on more screen real estate.
•	Eye to the Future: Gestures
•	The solution to menu creep? (They don't take up much real estate.)
•	Downside is they are non-self-disclosing. You don't know what functionality might be available.
•	Gesture interfaces can be more direct than their GUI counterpart.
•	Gestures are more natural (pinching to zoom etc) but there are still limitations (four fingers does what again?)
 
5.2—Mental models
•	What makes an interface learnable?
•	What leads to errors? Think of the door in the CS department where it would be better if they just removed the door handle if it wasn't operational anyway.
•	Ex: ref door. Better if they had a better mental map of what the user was already thinking.
The goal: design should beacon the right model
•	A user's model develops through interaction with the system.
•	Designers often expects a user's model to be the same as theirs, but often they aren't.
•	A mismatch between a designer/user's conceptual models leads to slow performance, errors, and frustration.
Mental models arise from experience, metaphor, and analogical reasoning.
•	The model for a text processor stems from the typewriter.
•	We have models and beliefs about our own behavior, of others, of objects, and software.
•	Our models are incomplete, inconsistent, and unstable in time, and are often rife with superstition.
Slips vs Mistakes
•	Slip—you have the right model of how the system works, but you accidentally do the wrong thing.
•	Mistakes—when I do what I intend to do, but I have the wrong model in my head.
•	As a designer, you prevent the two things differently.
•	Preventing slips—spread things out and make your UI ergonomics.
•	Preventing mistakes—provide better feedback or make clear what the options are. Ex: punching holes—0.6% of the the voters wanted to punch the second hole, but they thought the second hole would make them vote democratic.
•	To fix this, it would be easier to make voting standardized.
Good Mapping
 
Direct Manipulation Provides
•	We want to leverage real-world metaphors.
•	A good UI gives a user a good idea of how each object works and how to control it.
•	An interface should disclose how to use it.
If technology is to provide an advantage, the correspondence to the real world must break down at some point.
–Jonathan Grudin
•	We want to minimize the distance between the current practice.
•	Final Scratch (DJ software): The vinyl is specialized to play music through a computer speakers. You scratch vinyl but you play songs on the computer. You get to carry just a few records as opposed to many. It's also fun to watch.
 
5.3—Representation Matters
•	The representations provided by language, gesture, drawings, and objects help us communicate better. Different representations can facilitate or hinder different thoughts.
•	The way we represent ideas affect our thoughts.
•	Constraining a problem can make you solve things better. Easier to solve the arrangement problem if bagels vs oranges.
•	Different ways of presenting problems make it easier or harder to solve problems.
•	Proving stuff is easier because you have a solution in mind,
Solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent.
– Herbert Simon
•	Human beings are not good when it comes to working memory. By embedding constraints in the UI, you offload working memory so the limited resources become available to other people.
•	As much as possible, put things that can make the user offload the memory.
•	If you have something in mind, you have things inside your memory that preoccupy you and prevent you from doing the task at hand better.
Naturalness principle
•	Bagels are more natural than oranges because its properties better represent the object better
•	Proteus Ingestable Networked Pill: Ingesting the pill turns on a transmitter on your body and your stomach acid is a source of battery.
•	Print Preview: Much effective because it tells you which parts if ever will be cut off.
 
5.4-5.5—Distributing Cognition
When interfaces help people distribute cognition, it can
•	Encourage experimentation.
•	Scaffold learning and reduced errors through redundancy.
•	Show (only) differences that matter.
•	Convert slow calculation into fast perception.
•	Support chunking, especially by experts.
•	Increase efficiency.
•	Facilitate collaboration.
External Feedback: Cheap Experimentation
•	Tetris: It turns out that people move the pieces laterally more than they need to. Experts rely more heavily on moving objects in the world. They were distributing scenarios of "where can I put this". They outsource the thinking part.
•	A good representation allows people to experiment and tinker their strategy more.
•	Show the information that you need, and nothing else. Make users enable comparing, exploring, and problem solving.
London Underground subway map
•	People often wanted how to get from point A to point B. It turns out that the additional detail to the underlying topology made it difficult. This map shows the stations, stripped out the detail, and people were able to see more easily the correct direction to go to.
 
•	Focus+context representation: The center is denser than the suburbs. The suburb representations are squenched because their distances are less important than those around the center of London.
•	You take compromises because the distances are modified and you can make poor judgments on what's close and what's far.
Temperature map
•	If you know the physical coordinate (what's the temp along the coast), it works reasonably well.
•	Better if the temperature was represented by a color and a number.
Countour map colors
 
•	Arranging hues is arbitrary, we have a hard time figuring out which is deeper and what the colors mean.
•	The yellow pops out, taking the attention of the viewer.
•	Redesign
 
•	Above sea level: earth tone, "the land colored stuff is land and the water colored stuff is water".
•	The intensity and the luminence of the blues change with depth. Darker areas = deeper.
•	1972 chess example—expert chess players were better at remember the configuration of a chess board.
•	Experts are much remember at remembering the configuration of a board only if it was an actual game. Arranging the pieces in a board in a way that can't be achieved when playing chess and they aren't much better than normal people.
Visual or Textual?
•	Use visual when you can convert slow reasoning tasks such as checking out train stations into fast perception tasks by making them visually salient. Much easier to find things out at a glance.
•	Graphs show visual trends better than tables.
Informational Equivalence
•	Two representations are informationally equivalent if all the information presented in one can also be inferred from the other.
Informational equivalence != computational equivalence
•	"A pair of parallel lines is cut by a transversal."
•	This is hard to visualize in your head but easier to visualize when drawn down.
•	GUIs enable many common actions to be common perception tasks requiring smaller effort.
When interfaces help people distribute cognition, it can
•	Encourage experimentation (Tetris).
•	Scaffold learning and reduced errors through redundancy (Montessouri math blocks).
•	Show (only) differences that matter (London Underground).
•	Convert slow calculation into fast perception (Map coloring).
•	Support chunking, especially by experts (Chess & gestures).
•	Increase efficiency (Diagrams).
•	Facilitate collaboration (Cockpits).
Examples
•	What was the problem with the password that I enterred in? Do I need to have a minimum length, or have a set number of numbers and special characters?
•	"You must fill out all required fields." It doesn't show you what your mistake was. Either highlight the things you missed, or have a smaller form with the small things you need.
•	"Document encoding", even to programmers, which of these makes sense?
•	"Duplicate contact detected" doesn't show you the current information and what will happen when you approve of the change.
 
6.1—Visual Design
Whitespace conveys grouping
•	Some space must be narrow so that other space may be wide, and some space must be emptied so that some space may be filled.
•	We're able to chunk the visual design so that salient bits are together.
Use size contrasts to indicate hierarchy
•	Information consists of difference that make's a difference.
Three goals for visual design
•	Guide: Convey structure, relative importance, and relationships.
•	Pace: Draw people in, help orients, provide hooks to dive deep.
•	Message: Express meaning and style, breathe life into the content.
Case studies (Try blurring things)
•	The New York Times: You can see the header, the navigation on the left, the columns
•	Google: The highlighted search and navigation bar at the top disappears immediately, because it is not important.
•	The Google logo is still seeable and makes the "complicated web simpler than what it really is", primary colors
•	Craigslist: A lot of abbreviations and looks like it was created in 1996.
•	A lot of Craigslist users are repeat users!
•	Even while blurring, you can see the logo, the calendar, the categorized content, and the city navigation on the rigth.
•	Webby awards: Color is used sparingly. Red for "Watch this" and a few social media stuff.
Three Basic Tools of Visual Design
•	Typography, Layout, Color
A Minute to Learn, a Lifetime to Master
 
6.2—Typography
•	Gill Sans: The thickness of the letter varies considerably.
•	We don't necessarily want to be balanced.
Typography Terms
•	Point size: The point size means the "height of the lead block the text was set in".
•	Leading: The spacing between the lines. 20% of the font size = leading.
•	X-height: Height of the lower case letters. Higher x-type: Easier to read, lower : elegance.
•	Ascenders and descenders: Low x-height: longer ascenders/descenders.
•	Weight: Light, regular, bold.
•	Serifs
•	Numbers have upper-case and lower-case versions.
Which typefaces should I use?
•	Challenges in studying this
•	Individual differences for readers  dwarf manipulation effects
•	Reading requires familiarity, people are probably faster with their own style of reading
•	How to measure this? Speed or comprehension?
•	Not a lot of evidence for "serif hypothesis"
•	Mixed type is faster than all caps.
•	Proportional fonts are faster than typewriter fonts.
Legibility, in practice, amounts simply to what you are accustomed to.
•	More info seems to be contained in the top half of letters than the bottom cat.
•	Expectation plays a big role "TAE CAT"
•	For a long block of text, use a familiar font, and get high x-height.
•	Typefaces build reputations
•	Baskerville: Literary magazine
•	Optima: Cheap 1950s Hygiene products
Try
•	Use the typeface in multiple places to see its range
 
 
6.3—Grids, Grouping, and Alignment
•	Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines
•	Important things are at the top and those who are conceptually related are closer to each other
•	Bauhaus: The New Typography
•	Grids: Set of columns + white space between the columns
•	Newspapers have benefitted from the grids
•	When creating templates, design for the longest text block
•	German text often consumes a lot of real-estate relative to English/Spanish
Alignment guides the eye, reducing clutter
•	In general, left-aligned text is the fastes to skim
•	Boxes and change in colors are junky, try to eleminate them
•	Avoid slight misalignments because they undermine your ability to beacon organization.
•	We automatically notice patterns and deviations.
•	When you deviate from a pattern, do so strategically.
•	Use visual proximity and scale to convey semantic info.
Top, left, or right?
•	Addresses: Right aligned labels, you are able to see what you want to make out extremely clear
•	Account: Left-aligned labels: the key pieces are larger
•	Most important: Left
•	Less important/more familiar: Top because they don't stick out.
 
Right	 
Left/Top

 
A Brief Word on Color
•	Pay attention to it
•	Design in grayscale first
•	Keep luminance(grey-level) values from grayscale when moving to color
•	Java: Anything you can click on is colored
Good Example
 
•	Italics,  caps, whitespace
 
 
6.4—Reading and Navigating
•	People are informavores. People devour information. People look for ways to figure out information quickly.
•	The scent: People figure out how to get the information they want. They also realize what options are available.
How can you detect poor scent?
•	Flailing, low confidence, and clicking the back button.
 
•	The category names are unintuitive and surprising. Jargonish. The icons provide little additional information.
•	Generic icons don't really work.
•	Icons help when they facilitate repeat recognition.
•	Also when you know what something looks like but not what it's called.
•	Good redundant coding can help.
•	To improve the scent, put multi-word links. Put trigger words, not "clever" terms.
•	Instead of "Tracks", put "Tracks, Grading, & Statements of Accomplishment".
•	Instead of "Here is the video", write "here is the video".
•	In navigation, speak block navigation. By adding multiple layers or putting subheadings, you can help users on where they want to go.
•	The location of links ABSOLUTELY matter, see: Eyetracking.
Design for Glanceability
•	People glance at the top-left most of the time.
•	The Prime Real Estate is above the fold, where people expect.
•	Ads are usually not at the left.
People are more than happy to scroll if they think they'll be rewarded.
•	If the stuff above the fold isn't good, then people won't scroll.
•	People absolutely do not read. Sometimes people switch tabs and look across different sites.
•	Techniques:
•	Concise text
•	Scanable layout (Add bullets)
•	Objective language (numbers instead of fluff)
 
7.1—Designing Studies That You Can Learn From
•	When you ask people, "do you like my interface", there is always a please the experimenter effect.
•	Developers are valuable testers.
•	Ex: Instagram had regular feedback always.
•	When you ask people, "do you like my interface", there is often no comparison so it's hard to make decisions.
Baserates: How often does Y (clicking something, etc) occur?
•	This requires measuring Y.
Terms
•	Manipulations are independent variables because they are independent of what the user does.
•	Dependent: Task completion time, number of errors.
•	Recall: How much did people remember stuff? Would the person recommend this to a friend? What did the people feel?
•	Internal validity: How reliable is the experiment?
•	External validity: It is good to study enough people to make things work?
Ask yourself: "Is my cool new approach better than the industry standard?"
Example: IPhone testing in 2007
•	Manipulation: Input style (QWERTYs  vs iPhone)
•	Measure: Words per minute
•	It seems unfair because the users were experts in their old phones and novices in their new phones.
•	Is this difference statistically significant? Not sure.
•	When they went back a month later, when the iPhone people were more proficient, they were equally fast (iPhone and QWERTY). However, iPhone users had more errors per minute.
Is Interface X better than Interface Y?
•	That's better to ask, but what does better mean?
•	More often than not, experiences are not exclusively better than each other. The question is, "on what grounds are these interfaces better at?"
If you can control things, then you can learn stuff.
 
7.2—Assigning Participants to Conditions
Should every participant use every alternative?
•	Which vacuum cleaner is more effective?
•	Better to ask, what are the measures? Faster, cleaner, less faitgue, ergonomics, environmental impact, portability...
•	Measure: Faster and cleaner.
Manipulation: Vacuum type
Measure: Speed, cleanliness
•	Between subjects design: Half use one, half use the other. With just three people, it's hard to know if they are good at cleaning or there is an experimental results.
•	Within subjects design: Everyone uses both interfaces. We need to factor in ordering effects.
•	We can combine both lik ethis:
 
•	We can also ask them to clean different areas to factor in differing environments.
•	As to individual differences, it only depends on if you think that these really matters.
 
Other classifications
•	Latin square: People have different orders of what they do.
 
•	What's important is that we end up with a random assignment.
•	Ex: Typing in the morning versus typing in the afternoon.
•	The alternatives are also shown in different sequences.
•	Hawthorne effect: The effect comes from the change and not from the manipulations that you make.
Counterbalanced assignment
•	Use a pretest and posttest to fix conditions.
•	Offline cb: If you can pre-test everyone ahead of time, you can form matched pairs.
•	Online cb: Pick a threshold that's likely to be about the middle.

7.3—In Person Experiments
•	Relative merits: Online vs In-person?
•	Planning , executing, analyzing in-person studies.
First Step: Make Clear Goals
•	Scope: Make a meeting room booking system for Gates.
•	Purpose: Create a system that encourages people to book the right sized room for the right duration.
•	Hypothesis: Splitting the booking process over several screens will encourage more thought and people will book better.
•	Schedule and location: Stanford Gates building
•	Participants: 12 people. They should be realistic.
•	Scenarios: Go through the process of booking a room.
Plan Out the Steps
•	Questions
•	Will people book the right sized room for the right length of time?
•	Size of room booked?
•	How long is it booked for?
•	Time to complete the task of booking room.
•	What other actions do people do while booking.
•	One person to facilitate, another to take notes.
Create Concrete Tasks
•	"Imagine a planet just like Earth..."
Ethical Considerations
•	Sometimes, people feel that they are being put under a microscope. Avoid pressuring people to participate.
•	You are testing the site, not the users. Reassure them that if they are doing something bad, then there is a problem with the site.
Details
•	Order? Do you train them? Do you have an upper bound re: time?
•	Pilot your study. This is used to work out the kinks. Pilots can find real usability bugs. 2 pilots (1 with a colleague, and 1 with a real user).
Capturing results?
•	Notebook, record video (but don't make them insecure), screen recording.
•	Think aloud? If yes, then prompt people to keep talking. Do not take what people say super super seriously. People usually aren't being malicious but more often than not they just want to provide an answer.
Collecting data
•	Greeting
•	Process data: Observations
•	Bottom-line: Numbers such as task completion time
•	Debriefing
7.4—Running Web Experiments
•	A-B testing
•	We randomly split the traffic to the website to the live site and something you are testing out.
•	Without testing (A-B), you don't know if things work, because even designers get it wrong.
Ways design makes a difference
•	Position and color of primary call to action
•	Position on the page of testimonials, if used
•	Whether linked elements are in text or as images
•	Amount of white space
•	Position and prominence of main heading
•	Number of columns
•	Number of visual elements competing for attention
•	Age, sex, and appearance of someone in a photo.
Ex:
•	Email examples on how they look like.
•	Obama campaign sign-up text: "Sign up", "Learn more", "Sign up now", "Join us now"
•	Obama campaign visual material: "Get involved", "Family", "Change", "Barack's video", "Springfield video", "Sam's video": Video was the worst.
•	Seemingly insignificant changes, such as the wording of a button, can have a big impact.
•	Our expectations are often wrong, ex: we expect people to like videos more.
Which performed best?
•	I'm on Twitter.
•	Follow me on Twitter.
•	You should follow me on Twitter.
•	You should follow me on Twitter here.
•	The clearer your instructions are, the more people like.
Others
•	A very small typographical change shows a higher (.something) conversion rate.
•	Small differences accumulate.
•	Beware of anomalies: investigate further. (Think of February's 28 days!)
Checkout Page
 
•	5 changes: The killer difference was adding the box for a coupon code because people look for a cooking code and forget to go back.
 
•	Two stages of feedback has a huge effect.
Commitment escalation
•	Easier to get users to do things if you split the tasks. These are really subtle!
Principles for effective online experiments
•	Always run experiments at 50/50%.
•	To detect an effect, you need to expose a certain number of users to the treatment.
•	Initially, start an experiment at 0.1%.
•	Do some simple analyses to make sure no egregious problems can be detected.
•	Ramp up to a larger percentage, and repeat until 50%.
•	If negative, abort ASAP.
•	Don't just run experiments on easy things. Run experiments on things that are meaningful.
•	Run experiments for long enough so people can get used to things.
 
Rules for Running Assignment
•	Consistent: People should think that you are not updating the site always.
•	Durable
•	Independent or completely random. You want to run both at the same time in parallel.
•	Larger theories are still hard. We can't honestly be sure that it is our manipulation that changes things.
•	Using multple methods together helps.
Design in the online age
•	Designers role shifts to being about creating multiple alternatives
•	Peple are often too sure of themselves
•	Rapid experimentation means the first release is (sometimes) less important—fail fast.
 
7.7—Comparing Rates
3 Important Questions
•	What does my data look like? Plot and aggregate it.
•	What are the overall numbers? Aggregate statsitics for each condition.
•	Are the differences actually real? (Compute significance).
Pearson's Chi-Square
•	Observed vs Expected
