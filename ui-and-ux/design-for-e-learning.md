* Graphics and visuals should educate, not decorate. Decorative graphics are distracting and can hurt the learning process.
* Use simplified or abstracted visuals rather than realistic images to promote understanding.
* Words combined with pictures teach better than words alone.
* The vast majority of the general population are visual learners: coordinate learning for your audience.
* Large type, make it easier for readers to read the quizzes. Consistent formatting.
* Metaphors should be used for introducing new ideas.
* Animations should add value, not be vegas. Nothing that is blinking or flashing.
* Set learning in real-world graphical contexts rather than fantasy worlds to facilitate transfer of learning to the workplace.
* Avoid extraneous detail.
* Present objectives using the “Now” way (standard bullets, wall of words).
* Use bullets and fonts to highlight key concepts for learners wihtout bogging down your pages with text.
* Visual easier to remember rather than bullet points.
* Test conceptual pictures with audience first.
* Don’t say click the red button, say click the next button (color blindness).
* Navigation: full control for experts, limited control for novices.
* Gradient fills for the graphic objects. Use gradients to add depth to your graphics objects and make the graphics more pleasing to the eye.
* No red+green because people are color blind to rg.
* One color only.
* BANGPP: balance, alignment, negative space, grid, proximity, perimeter edge.
* Virtual keyboards cover up screen real estate.
 
Data
* Analog format: Good beause they are can last for a long time, such as the Rosetta stone.
* Important numbers: Fibonacci and Golden Ratio.
* Stupid shit: Charts made of images. Duplicate data. Background images. 3-D graphs.
* You should have high data-pixel ratio.
* Humans are good at creating artificial groupings based on relative position so deliberately use white space.
* Shapes: can be used as alternative for colors, especially for the color-blind. 5% of males are color-blind.
# use this to determine if white or black text will be put
function contrast($hexcolor){
    return (hexdec($hexcolor) >0xffffff/2)? black : white ;
}
* If you want to make things not have a big difference, then use 3-dimensional figures. It’s harder to figure out that figure 2 is twice the size of figure 1.
 
* Widening the charts make it seem that twice is super huge.
 
* Tick marks can have a big effect in checking which are the maximum and minimum values.
