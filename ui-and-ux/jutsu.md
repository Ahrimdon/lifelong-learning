# Designing the perfect search experience
[Reference](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-the-search-experience-a9b1f1f9283)

- Design objective: Are they looking for a specific result, or a list of results with a specific filter applied?
- Ex: For AirBnb, the desired output would be a list of results with a specific filter applied, not exactly the search result?
- Food listing app: When they are searching for a food place, they want to know whether a particular restaurant is good. They are "craving for burgers"< but no specific place in mind. So it is a combination of filters (category + location) and specific results.
- Organising results: Medium separates results into people, publications, and tags.
- Sucky stuff:
  - Erasing the user's search keyword after clicked search
  - Hard to find search boxes
  - No support for typos/misspellings
  - Poorly defined pre-filters and separators
  - Irrelevant auto-complete suggestions
