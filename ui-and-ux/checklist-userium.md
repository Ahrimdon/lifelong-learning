# Usability Checklist

## User Experience

- *Personalized features.* Currency, language, country specific deals, taxes, or delivery options are changed based on user's location. IP-based geolocation is not enabled without user's permission.
- *Registering provides value to users.* "Free Trial" communicates a clear benefit, but a "Register" button doesn't. Unnecessary registration is avoided.
- *Transparent pricing.* Prices are clearly displayed. There are no hidden costs or surprises in the terms.
- *Pages don't refresh automatically.* Users can get confused if new content is uploaded suddenly, for example on news websites.
- *Sample content.* There is a sample newsletter next to a newsletter sign up form.
- *Website is credible.* Credible references, credentials, contact information, location, and images of real people are displayed on the website.
- *Uncluttered product and service information.* Information is scannable and images can be enlarged or zoomed in on for more detailed viewing.

## Homepage

- *Clear CTA.* Users know what to do next and why it benefits them. They understand the value proposition and purpose of the site.
- *First impression.* The homepage creates a positive first impression and supports conversion.
- *Logged in user's name is displayed on the site.* "Hello, Charles", not "Hello, Sir."
- *Major changes to the site are announced on the homepage.* Ex: changes in delivery policy or website downtimes.
- *Company location and contact information is easily accessible from the homepage.*
- *Privacy policy in case the site gathers information about users.*
- *Images and videos are relevant and meaningful.* No unrelated stock photos of models. High-quality screenshots, videos, or photos of the products and services.
- *URL redirection.* Site URL works with or without the `www`.

## Accessibility

- *Alt attributes provided for non-text elements.*
- *Color alone is not used to convey information.*
- *Content is readable without a style sheet.*
- *Accessible navigation.* Site can be navigated with a keyboard, without using a mouse.
- *Links, buttons, and checkboxes are easily clickable.* A user can select a checkbox by clicking the text, not just the checkbox.

## Navigation

- *Important links aren't placed in moving features.*
- *Alphabetical A-Z sorting is avoided.*
- *Users know where they are on the site.* Breadcrumbs or site map.
- *Navigation is consistent on every page.*
- *Links are descriptive.* No "click here" links.
- *There is a site description in the window title, which is easily understandable as a bookmark.*

## Search

- *Search bar.*
- *Search is available on every page.*
- *Search is wide enough so users can see what they've typed.*
- *Search is a form where yusers can type search words immediately, not a link.*

## Links

- *Important commands are displayed as buttons, not links. "Buy" or "Pay" is a button, not a link.*
- *Links are easily recognizable.* They look clickable. Items that aren't links don't look clickable.
- *Visited links color is different from unvisited.*
- *No broken links.*

## Layout

- *Minimum amount of pop-up windows.*
- *Enough white space to support scanning.*

## Process

- *Issue tracking.* Usability and UX issues are tracked in an issue tracker.
- *User testing.* Testing with target users is done at different stages of the project.
- *Prioritizing.* Changes are prioritized based on their importance.
- *ROI of changes.* Website is evaluated before and after making changes.

## Forms

- *Simplicity.* Only absolutely necessary questions are asked in forms.
- *Long dropdown menus are avoided.* Users can input text, which is validated on the backend.
- *Form submission is confirmed (confirmation page).*
- *Error messages are shown next to the input field, not just on top of the page.*

## Content

- *Contrast. Adequate contrast between the text and the background.*
- *Content is scannable.* Short paragraphs, descriptive headings, lists and images. Visual content is used when appropriate, instead of large amounts of text.
- *Content is written with common language that users can easily understand.*
- *Use of uppercase letters in prose text is avoided.* Uppercase is used only for formatting.
