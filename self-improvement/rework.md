## REWORK  

We started out in 1999 as a three-person Web-design consulting firm. In 2004, we weren't happy with the project-management software used by the rest of the industry, so we created our own: Basecamp. When we showed the online tool to clients and colleagues, they all said the same thing: "We need this for our business too." Five years later, Basecamp generates millions of dollars a year in profits.

Some people consider us an Internet company, but that makes us cringe. Internet companies are known for hiring compulsively, spending wildly, and failing spectacularly. That's not us. We're small (sixteen people as this book goes to press), frugal, and profitable.

####  Ignore the real world 

This real world sounds like an awfully depressing place to live. It's a place where new ideas, unfamiliar approaches, and foreign concepts always lose. The only things that win are what people already know and do, even if those things are flawed and inefficient.

The real world isn't a place, it's an excuse. It's a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.

####  Learning from mistakes is overrated 

Don't inhale. Don't get fooled by the stats. Other people's failures are just that: other people's failures. If other people can't market their product, it has nothing to do with you. If other people can't build a team, it has nothing to do with you. If other people can't price their services properly, it has nothing to do with you. If other people can't earn more than they spend ... well, you get it.

You need to learn from your mistakes. What do you really learn from mistakes? You might learn what not to do again, but how valuable is that? You still don't know what you should do next.

Success gives you real ammunition. When something succeeds, you know what worked--and you can do it again. And the next time, you'll probably do it even better.

Failure is not a prerequisite for success. A Harvard Business School study found already-successful entrepreneurs are far more likely to succeed again (the success rate for their future companies is 34 percent). But entrepreneurs whose companies failed the first time had almost the same follow-on success rate as people starting a company for the first time: just 23 percent. People who failed before have the same amount of success as people who have never tried at all.

Success is the experience that actually counts. That shouldn't be a surprise: It's exactly how nature works. Evolution doesn't linger on past failures, it's always building upon what worked. So should you.

####  Planning is guessing 

Why don't we just call plans what they really are: guesses. Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses, and your strategic plans as strategic guesses. Now you can stop worrying about them as much. They just aren't worth the stress.

When you turn guesses into plans, you enter a danger zone. Plans let the past drive the future. They put blinders on you. "This is where we're going because, well, that's where we said we were going." And that's the problem: Plans are inconsistent with improvisation.

The timing of long-range plans is screwed up too. You have the most information when you're doing something, not before you've done it. Yet when do you write a plan? Usually it's before you've even begun. That's the worst time to make a big decision.

It's OK to wing it. Just get on the plane and go. You can pick up a nicer shirt, shaving cream, and a toothbrush once you get there. Working without a plan may seem scary. But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier.

####  Why grow? 

Why is that? What is it about growth and business? Why is expansion always the 
goal? What's the attraction of big besides ego? (You'll need a better answer than 
"economies of scale.") What's wrong with finding the right size and staying there?

Grow slow and see what feels right--premature hiring is the 
death of many companies. And avoid huge growth spurts too--they can cause you to skip 
right over your appropriate size.

Have you ever noticed that while small businesses wish they were bigger, big 
businesses dream about being more agile and flexible? And remember, once you get big, 
it's really hard to shrink without firing people, damaging morale, and changing the entire 
way you do business.

Ramping up doesn't have to be your goal. And we're not talking just about the 
number of employees you have either. It's also true for expenses, rent, IT infrastructure, 
furniture, etc. These things don't just happen to you. You decide whether or not to take 
them on. And if you do take them on, you'll be taking on new headaches, too. Lock in 
lots of expenses and you force yourself into building a complex businesss--one that's a lot 
more difficult and stressful to run

#### Workaholism

Working more doesn't mean 
you care more or get more done. It just means you work more Q

. First off, working 
like that just isn't sustainable over time. When the burnout crash comes--and it will--it'll 
hit that much harder.

They try to fix problems by throwing sheer hours 
at them. They try to make up for intellectual laziness with brute force. This results in 
inelegant solutions.

They create 
problems (often unwittingly) just so they can get off on working more

Workaholics make the people who don't stay late feel inadequate for "merely" 
working reasonable hours. That leads to guilt and poor morale all around. Plus, it leads to 
an ass-in-seat mentality--people stay late out of obligation, even if they aren't really being 
productive

Workaholics aren't heroes. They don't save the day, they just use it up. The real 
hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get things done.

####  Make a dent in the universe 

To do great work, you need to feel that you're making a difference. That you're 
putting a meaningful dent in the universe. That you're part of something important.

This doesn't mean you need to find the cure for cancer. It's just that your efforts 
need to feel valuable. You want your customers to say, "This makes my life better." You 
want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do, people would notice.

You should feel an urgency about this too. You don't have forever. This is y life's work. Do you want to build just another me-too product or do you want to shake 
things up? What you do is your legacy. Don't sit around and wait for someone else to 
make the change you want to see. And don't think it takes a huge team to make that 
difference either

####  Scratch your own itch 

The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to 
make something you want to use. That lets you design what you know--and you'll figure 
out immediately whether or not what you're making is any good.

When you build a product or service, you make the call on hundreds of tiny 
decisions each day. If you're solving someone else's problem, you're constantly stabbing 
in the dark. When you solve your own problem, the light comes on. You know exactly 
what the right answer is.

Best of all, this "solve your own problem" approach lets you fall in love with what 
you're making. You know the problem and the value of its solution intimately. There's no 
substitute for that. After all, you'll (hopefully) be working on this for years to come.

####  Draw a line in the sand 

Great 
businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service. You have to believe in 
something. You need to have a backbone. You need to know what you're willing to fight 
for. And then you need to show the world. 
 A strong stand is how you attract superfans. They point to you and defend you. 
And they spread the word further, wider, and more passionately than any advertising 
could

Strong opinions aren't free. You'll turn some people off. They'll accuse you of 
being arrogant and aloof. That's life. For everyone who loves you, there will be others 
who hate you. If no one's upset by what you're saying, you're probably not pushing hard 
enough. (And you're probably boring, too.) 

We're willing to lose 
some customers if it means that others love our products intensely. That's our line in the 
sand.

####  Outside money is Plan Z 

We're in a service economy now. Service businesses (e.g., consultants, software 
companies, wedding planners, graphic designers, and hundreds of others) don't require 
much to get going. If you're running a business like that, avoid outside funding.

In fact, no matter what kind of business you're starting, take on as little outside 
cash as you can. Spending other people's money may sound great, but there's a noose 
attached. Here's why:You give up control. When you turn to outsiders for funding, you have to answer to them too. That's fine at first, when everyone agrees. But what happens 
down the road? Are you starting your own business to take orders from someone else? 
Raise money and that's what you'll wind up doing. "Cashing out" begins to trump 
building a quality business

Spending other people's money is addictive. 
There's nothing easier than spending other people's money. But then you run out and need 
to go back for more. And every time you go back, they take more of your company. It's 
usually a bad deal. When you're just beginning, you have no leverage. That's a terrible 
time to enter into any financial transaction. Customers move down the totem pole. You 
wind up building what investors want instead of what customers want. Raising money is 
incredibly distracting. Seeking funding is difficult and draining. It takes months of pitch 
meetings, legal maneuvering, contracts, etc. That's an enormous distraction when you 
should really be focused on building something great.

#### You need less than you think 

Do you really need ten people or will two or three do for now? 
 Do you really need $500,000 or is $50,000 (or $5,000) enough for now? 
 Do you really need six months or can you make something in two? 
 Do you really need a big office or can you share office space (or work from 
home) for a while? 
 Do you really need a warehouse or can you rent a small storage space (or use your 
garage or basement) or outsource it completely? 
 Do you really need to buy advertising and hire a PR firm or are there other ways 
to get noticed? 
 Do you really need to build a factory or can you hire someone else to manufacture 
your products?

Do you really need an accountant or can you use Quicken and do it yourself? 
 Do you really need an IT department or can you outsource it? 
 Do you really need a full-time support person or can you handle inquiries on your 
own? 
 Do you really need to open a retail store or can you sell your product online? 
 Do you really need fancy business cards, letterhead, and brochures or can you 
forego that stuff? 
 You get the point. Maybe eventually you'll need to go the bigger, more expensive 
route, but not right now. 
 There's nothing wrong with being frugal. When we launched our first product, we 
did it on the cheap. We didn't get our own office; we shared space with another company. 
We didn't get a bank of servers; we had only one. We didn't advertise; we promoted by 
sharing our experiences online. We didn't hire someone to answer customer e-mails; the 
company founder answered them himself. And everything worked out just fine. 
 Great companies start in garages all the time. Yours can too. 

####  Building to flip is building to flop 

You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. You should be thinking 
about how to make your project grow and succeed, not how you're going to jump ship. If 
your whole strategy is based on leaving, chances are you won't get far in the first place

You see so many aspiring businesspeople pinning their hopes on selling out. But 
the odds of getting acquired are so tiny. There's only a slim chance that some big suitor 
will come along and make it all worthwhile. Maybe 1 in 1,000? Or 1 in 10,000? 

And let's say you ignore this advice and do pull off a flip. You build your 
business, sell it, and get a nice payday. Then what? Move to an island and sip pina 
coladas all day? Will that really satisfy you? Will money alone truly make you happy? 
Are you sure you'll like that more than running a business you actually enjoy and believe 
in? 

That's why you often hear about business owners who sell out, retire for six 
months, and then get back in the game. They miss the thing they gave away. And usually, 
they're back with a business that isn't nearly as good as their first.

####  Less mass

Embrace the idea of having less mass. Right now, you're the smallest, the leanest, 
and the fastest you'll ever be. From here on out, you'll start accumulating mass. And the 
more massive an object, the more energy required to change its direction. It's as true in 
the business world as it is in the physical world.

Long-term contracts 
 Excess staff 
 Permanent decisions 
 Meetings 
 Thick process 
 Inventory (physical or mental) 
 Hardware, software, and technology lock-ins 
 Long-term road maps 
 Office politics

Avoid these things whenever you can. That way, you'll be able to change 
direction easily. The more expensive it is to make a change, the less likely you are to 
make it.

## Less is a Good Thing

Embrace constraints. "I don't have enough time/money/people/experience." Stop whining. Less is a 
good thing. Constraints are advantages in disguise. Limited resources force you to make 
do with what you've got. There's no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative.

Writers use constraints to force creativity all the time. Shakespeare reveled in the 
limitations of sonnets (fourteen-line lyric poems in iambic pentameter with a specific 
rhyme scheme). Haiku and limericks also have strict rules that lead to creative results. 
Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Raymond Carver found that forcing themselves to 
use simple, clear language helped them deliver maximum impact.

The Price Is Right, the longest-running game show in history, is also a great 
example of creativity born from embracing constraints. The show has more than a 
hundred games, and each one is based on the question "How much does this item cost?" 

When we were building Basecamp, we had plenty of limitations. We had a design 
firm to run with existing client work, a seven-hour time difference between principals 
(David was doing the programming in Denmark, the rest of us were in the States), a small 
team, and no outside funding. These constraints forced us to keep the product simple

These days, we have more resources and people, but we still force constraints. We 
make sure to have only one or two people working on a product at a time. And we always 
keep features to a minimum

####  Build half a product, not a half-assed product 

You can turn a bunch of great ideas into a crappy product real fast by trying to do 
them all at once. You just can't do everything you want to do and do it well. You have 
limited time, resources, ability, and focus. It's hard enough to do one thing right. Trying 
to do ten things well at the same time? Forget about it.

Most of your great ideas won't seem all that great once you get some perspective, 
anyway. And if they truly are that fantastic, you can always do them later. 

####  Start at the epicenter 

When you start anything new, there are forces pulling you in a variety of 
directions. There's the stuff you could do, the stuff you want to do, and the stuff you have 
to do. The stuff you have to do is where you should begin. Start at the epicenter.

#### Ignore the details early on 

So ignore the details--for a while. Nail the basics first and worry about 
the specifics later.

Besides, you often can't recognize the details that matter most until after you start 
building. That's when you see what needs more attention. You feel what's missing. And 
that's when you need to pay attention, not sooner.

####  Making the call is making progress 

When you put off decisions, they pile up. And piles end up ignored, dealt with in 
haste, or thrown out. As a result, the individual problems in those piles stay unresolved. 
 Whenever you can, swap "Let's think about it" for "Let's decide on it." Commit to 
making decisions. Don't wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward.

Decisions are 
progress. Each one you make is a brick in your foundation. You can't build on top of 
"We'll decide later," but you can build on top of "Done." 

An example from our world: For a long time, we avoided creating an affiliate 
program for our products because the "perfect" solution seemed way too complicated: 
We'd have to automate payments, mail out checks, figure out foreign tax laws for 
overseas affiliates, etc. The breakthrough came when we asked, "What can we easily do 
right now that's good enough?" The answer: Pay affiliates in credit instead of cash. So 
that's what we did.

We stuck with that approach for a while and then eventually implemented a 
system that pays cash. And that's a big part of this: You don't have to live with a decision 
forever. If you make a mistake, you can correct it later. 

Long projects zap morale. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to 
launch. Make the call, make progress, and get something out now--while you've got the 
motivation and momentum to do so.

####  Be a curator 

You don't make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single 
room. That's a warehouse. What makes a museum great is the stuff that's not on the walls. 
Someone says no. A curator is involved, making conscious decisions about what should 
stay and what should go. There's an editing process. There's a lot more stuff off the walls 
than on the walls. The best is a sub-sub-subset of all the possibilities. 

It's the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, 
simplify, and streamline. Be a curator. Stick to what's truly essential. Pare things down 
until you're left with only the most important stuff. Then do it again. You can always add 
stuff back in later if you need to.

The owner actually tried the oil and chooses to carry it based on its taste. It's not 
about packaging, marketing, or price. It's about quality. He tried it and knew his store had 
to carry it. That's the approach you should take too. 

####  Throw less at the problem 

Watch chef Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and you'll see a pattern. The 
menus at failing restaurants offer too many dishes. The owners think making every dish 
under the sun will broaden the appeal of the restaurant. Instead it makes for crappy food 
(and creates inventory headaches).

That's why Ramsay's first step is nearly always to trim the menu, usually from 
thirty-plus dishes to around ten. Think about that. Improving the current menu doesn't 
come first. Trimming it down comes first. Then he polishes what's left.

When things aren't working, the natural inclination is to throw more at the 
problem. More people, time, and money. All that ends up doing is making the problem 
bigger. The right way to go is the opposite direction: Cut back.

That's a fool's path. You start focusing on fashion instead of substance. You start 
paying attention to things that are constantly changing instead of things that last.

The core of your business should be built around things that won't change. Things 
that people are going to want today and ten years from now. Those are the things you 
should invest in.

Amazon.com focuses on fast (or free) shipping, great selection, friendly return policies, and affordable prices. These things will always be in high demand. 

Japanese automakers also focus on core principles that don't change: reliability, 
affordability, and practicality. People wanted those things thirty years ago, they want 
them today, and they'll want them thirty years from now

For 37signals, things like speed, simplicity, ease of use, and clarity are our focus. 
Those are timeless desires. People aren't going to wake up in ten years and say, "Man, I 
wish software was harder to use." They won't say, "I wish this application was slower." 

####  Tone is in your fingers 

e truth is your tone comes from you. 
 It's tempting for people to obsess over tools instead of what they're going to do 
with those tools. You know the type: Designers who use an avalanche of funky typefaces 
and fancy Photoshop filters but don't have anything to say. 

People use equipment as a crutch. They don't want to put in the hours on the 
driving range so they spend a ton in the pro shop. They're looking for a shortcut. But you 
just don't need the best gear in the world to be good. And you definitely don't need it to 
get started.

In business, too many people obsess over tools, software tricks, scaling issues, 
fancy office space, lavish furniture, and other frivolities instead of what really matters. 
And what really matters is how to actually get customers and make money.


####  Sell your by-products 

When you make something, you always make something else. You can't make 
just one thing. Everything has a by-product. Observant and creative business minds spot 
these by-products and see opportunities.

The lumber industry sells what used to be waste--sawdust, chips, and shredded 
wood--for a pretty profit. You'll find these by-products in synthetic fireplace logs, 
concrete, ice strengtheners, mulch, particleboard, fuel, and more.

Our last book, Getting Real, was a by-product. We wrote that book without even knowing it. The experience that came from building a company and building software 
was the waste from actually doing the work. Book earned money.

Software companies don't usually think about writing books. Bands don't usually 
think about filming the recording process. Car manufacturers don't usually think about 
selling charcoal. There's probably something you haven't thought about that you could 
sell too

####  Launch now 

Just because you've still got a list of things to do doesn't mean it's not done. Don't 
hold everything else up because of a few leftovers. You can do them later. And doing 
them later may mean doing them better, too.

If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what 
would you cut out? Funny how a question like that forces you to focus. You suddenly 
realize there's a lot of stuff you don't need. And what you do need seems obvious. When 
you impose a deadline, you gain clarity. It's the best way to get to that gut instinct that 
tells you, "We don't need this."

When we launched Basecamp, we didn't even have the ability to bill customers! 
Because the product billed in monthly cycles, we knew we had a thirty-day gap to figure 
it out. So we used the time before launch to solve more urgent problems that actually 
mattered on day one. Day 30 could wait.

Camper, a brand of shoes, opened a store in San Francisco before construction 
was even finished and called it a Walk in Progress. Customers could draw on the walls of 
the empty store. Camper displayed shoes on cheap plywood laid over dozens of shoe 
boxes. The most popular message written by customers on the walls: "Keep the store just 
the way it is."*

Don't mistake this approach for skimping on quality, either. You still want to 
make something great. This approach just recognizes that the best way to get there is 
through iterations. Stop imagining what's going to work. Find out for real.

## PRODUCTIVITY

####  Illusions of agreement 

The business world is littered with dead documents that do nothing but waste 
people's time. Reports no one reads, diagrams no one looks at, and specs that never 
resemble the finished product. These things take forever to make but only seconds to 
forget.

If you need to explain something, try getting real with it. Instead of describing 
what something looks like, draw it. Instead of explaining what something sounds like, 
hum it. Do everything you can to remove layers of abstraction.

The problem with abstractions (like reports and documents) is that they create 
illusions of agreement. A hundred people can read the same words, but in their heads, 
they're imagining a hundred different things.

 That's why you want to get to something real right away. That's when you get true understanding. It's like when we read about characters in a book--we each picture them 
differently in our heads. But when we actually see people, we all know exactly what they 
look like.

When the team at Alaska Airlines wanted to build a new Airport of the Future, 
they didn't rely on blueprints and sketches. They got a warehouse and built mock-ups 
using cardboard boxes for podiums, kiosks, and belts. The team then built a small 
prototype in Anchorage to test systems with real passengers and employees. The design 
that resulted from this getting-real process has significantly reduced wait times and 
increased agent productivity.*

That's the path we all should take. Get the chisel out and start making something 
real. Anything else is just a distraction.

####  Reasons to quit: Ask yourself these questions:

- Why are you doing this? What is this for? Who benefits? What's the motivation behind it?
- What problem are you solving? What's the problem? Are cx confused, or is there something not clear enough?
- Is this actually useful? Are you making somehting useful or just making something? It's easy to confuse enthusiasm with usefulness.
- Are you adding value? Adding something is easy; adding value is hard. Is this thing you're working on actually making your product valuable for cx? Can they get mor out of it than before?
- Will this change behavior?
- Is there an easier way?
- What could you be doing instead?
- Is it really worth it? Is the meeting worth pulling 6 people off work? Is it worth pulling an all-nighter, or could you just finish it tomorrow? Is it worth getting stressed over a competitor's press release? It it worth spending your money on advertising?

#### Interruption is the enemy of productivity

If you're constantly staying late and working weekends, it's not because there's too 
much work to be done. It's because you're not getting enough done at work. And the 
reason is interruptions.

When do you get most of your work done? If you're like most 
people, it's at night or early in the morning. It's no coincidence that these are the times 
when nobody else is around.

At 2 p.m., people are usually in a meeting or answering e-mail or chatting with 
colleagues. Those taps on the shoulder and little impromptu get-togethers may seem 
harmless, but they're actually corrosive to productivity. Interruption is not collaboration, 
it's just interruption. And when you're interrupted, you're not getting work done.

Interruptions break your workday into a series of work moments. Forty-five 
minutes and then you have a call. Fifteen minutes and then you have lunch. An hour later, 
you have an afternoon meeting. Before you know it, it's five o'clock, and you've only had 
a couple uninterrupted hours to get your work done. You can't get meaningful things 
done when you're constantly going start, stop, start, stop.

Getting into that zone takes time and requires avoiding interruptions. It's like 
REM sleep: You don't just go directly into REM sleep. You go to sleep first and then 
make your way to REM. Any interruptions force you to start over. And just as REM is 
when the real sleep magic happens, the alone zone is where the real productivity magic 
happens

Your alone zone doesn't have to be in the wee hours, though. You can set up a 
rule at work that half the day is set aside for alone time. Decree that from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m., people can't talk to each other (except during lunch). Or make the first or last half of 
the day your alone-time period. Or instead of casual Fridays, try no-talk Thursdays. Just 
make sure this period is unbroken in order to avoid productivity-zapping interruptions.

Or make the first or last half of 
the day your alone-time period. Or instead of casual Fridays, try no-talk Thursdays. Just 
make sure this period is unbroken in order to avoid productivity-zapping interruptions.

Better to use non-interruptive stuff like email rather than interruptive ones like phone calls and face-to-face meetings.

####  Meetings are toxic 

The worst interruptions of all are meetings. Here's why: 
 They're usually about words and abstract concepts, not real things. 
 They usually convey an abysmally small amount of information per minute. 
 They drift off-subject easier than a Chicago cab in a snowstorm. 
 They require thorough preparation that most people don't have time for. 
 They frequently have agendas so vague that nobody is really sure of the goal. 
 They often include at least one moron who inevitably gets his turn to waste 
everyone's time with nonsense. 
 Meetings procreate. One meeting leads to another meeting leads to another ... 
 It's also unfortunate that meetings are typically scheduled like TV shows. You set 
aside thirty minutes or an hour because that's how scheduling software works (you'll 
never see anyone schedule a seven-minute meeting with Outlook). Too bad. If it only 
takes seven minutes to accomplish a meeting's goal, then that's all the time you should 
spend. Don't stretch seven into thirty

When you think about it, the true cost of meetings is staggering. Let's say you're 
going to schedule a meeting that lasts one hour, and you invite ten people to attend. 
That's actually a ten-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting. You're trading ten hours of 
productivity for one hour of meeting time. And it's probably more like fifteen hours, because there are mental switching costs that come with stopping what you're doing, 
going somewhere else to meet, and then resuming what you were doing beforehand.

Is it ever OK to trade ten or fifteen hours of productivity for one hour of meeting? 
Sometimes, maybe. But that's a pretty hefty price to pay. Judged on a pure cost basis, 
meetings of this size quickly become liabilities, not assets. Think about the time you're 
actually losing and ask yourself if it's really worth it. 
 If you decide you absolutely must get together, try to make your meeting a 
productive one by sticking to these simple rules:

Set a timer. When it rings, meeting's over. Period. 
 Invite as few people as possible. 
 Always have a clear agenda. 
 Begin with a specific problem. 
 Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things 
and suggest real changes. 
 End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it. 

## Good enough is fine 

A lot of people get off on solving problems with complicated solutions. Flexing 
your intellectual muscles can be intoxicating. Then you start looking for another big 
challenge that gives you that same rush, regardless of whether it's a good idea or not.

A better idea: Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. Judo solutions are all about getting the most out of doing the least. 
Whenever you face an obstacle, look for a way to judo it.

 Problems can usually be solved with simple, mundane solutions. That means 
there's no glamorous work. You don't get to show off your amazing skills. You just build 
something that gets the job done and then move on. This approach may not earn you oohs 
and aahs, but it lets you get on with it. 


When good enough gets the job done, go for it. It's way better than wasting 
resources or, even worse, doing nothing because you can't afford the complex solution. 
And remember, you can usually turn good enough into great later. 

####  Quick wins 

Momentum fuels motivation. It keeps you going. It drives you. Without it, you 
can't go anywhere. If you aren't motivated by what you're working on, it won't be very 
good

The way you build momentum is by getting something done and then moving on 
to the next thing. No one likes to be stuck on an endless project with no finish line in 
sight. Being in the trenches for nine months and not having anything to show for it is a 
real buzzkill. Eventually it just burns you out. To keep your momentum and motivation 
up, get in the habit of accomplishing small victories along the way. Even a tiny 
improvement can give you a good jolt of momentum

 The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it. 

If you absolutely have to work on long-term projects, try to dedicate one day a 
week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm. Small victories let 
you celebrate and release good news. And you want a steady stream of good news. When 
there's something new to announce every two weeks, you energize your team and give 
your customers something to be excited about. 
 So ask yourself, "What can we do in two weeks?" And then do it. Get it out there 
and let people use it, taste it, play it, or whatever. The quicker it's in the hands of 
customers, the better off you'll be

####  Don't be a hero 

A lot of times it's better to be a quitter than a hero. 
 For example, let's say you think a task can be done in two hours. But four hours 
into it, you're still only a quarter of the way done. The natural instinct is to think, "But I 
can't give up now, I've already spent four hours on this!"

give up now, I've already spent four hours on this!" 
 So you go into hero mode. You're determined to make it work (and slightly 
embarrassed that it isn't already working). You grab your cape and shut yourself off from 
the world. 
 And sometimes that kind of sheer effort overload works. But is it worth it? 
Probably not. The task was worth it when you thought it would cost two hours, not 
sixteen. In those sixteen hours, you could have gotten a bunch of other things done. Plus, 
you cut yourself off from feedback, which can lead you even further down the wrong 
path. Even heroes need a fresh pair of eyes sometimes--someone else to give them a 
reality check.

So we decided that if anything takes one of us longer than two weeks, we've got to bring other people in to take a look. They 
might not do any work on the task, but at least they can review it quickly and give their 
two cents. Sometimes an obvious solution is staring you right in the face, but you can't 
even see it

Keep in mind that the obvious solution might very well be quitting. People 
automatically associate quitting with failure, but sometimes that's exactly what you 
should do. If you already spent too much time on something that wasn't worth it, walk 
away. You can't get that time back. The worst thing you can do now is waste even more 
time. 

####  Go to sleep 

 Forgoing sleep is a bad idea. Sure, you get those extra hours right now, but you pay in spades later: You destroy your creativity, morale, and attitude. 

Once in a while, you can pull an all-nighter if you fully understand the 
consequences. Just don't make it a habit. If it becomes a constant, the costs start to 
mount:Stubbornness: When you're really tired, it always seems easier to plow down 
whatever bad path you happen to be on instead of reconsidering the route. The finish line 
is a constant mirage and you wind up walking in the desert way too long. Lack of 
creativity: Creativity is one of the first things to go when you lose sleep. What 
distinguishes people who are ten times more effective than the norm is not that they work 
ten times as hard; it's that they use their creativity to come up with solutions that require 
one-tenth of the effort. Without sleep, you stop coming up with those one-tenth solutions. 
Diminished morale: When your brain isn't firing on all cylinders, it loves to feed on less 
demanding tasks. Like reading yet another article about stuff that doesn't matter. When 
you're tired, you lose motivation to attack the big problems. Irritability: Your ability to 
remain patient and tolerant is severely reduced when you're tired. If you encounter 
someone who's acting like a fool, there's a good chance that person is suffering from 
sleep deprivation

####  Your estimates suck 

We're all terrible estimators. We think we can guess how long something will 
take, when we really have no idea. We see everything going according to a best-case 
scenario, without the delays that inevitably pop up. Reality never sticks to best-case 
scenarios.

That's why estimates that stretch weeks, months, and years into the future are 
fantasies. The truth is you just don't know what's going to happen that far in advance.

Even with these simple tasks, our estimates are often off by a factor of two or 
more. If we can't be accurate when estimating a few hours, how can we expect to 
accurately predict the length of a "six-month project"? 

The solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier 
it is to estimate. You're probably still going to get it wrong, but you'll be a lot less wrong 
than if you estimated a big project. If something takes twice as long as you expected, 
better to have it be a small project that's a couple weeks over rather than a long one that's 
a couple months over.

####  Long lists don't get done 

Start making smaller to-do lists too. Long lists collect dust. When's the last time 
you finished a long list of things? You might have knocked off the first few, but chances 
are you eventually abandoned it (or blindly checked off items that weren't really done 
properly).

Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you 
feel about it. And at a certain point, you just stop looking at it because it makes you feel 
bad. Then you stress out and the whole thing turns into a big mess.

For 
example, break a single list of a hundred items into ten lists of ten items. That means 
when you finish an item on a list, you've completed 10 percent of that list, instead of 1 
percent.

Yes, you still have the same amount of stuff left to do. But now you can look at 
the small picture and find satisfaction, motivation, and progress. That's a lot better than 
staring at the huge picture and being terrified and demoralized. 
 Whenever you can, divide problems into smaller and smaller pieces until you're 
able to deal with them completely and quickly. Simply rearranging your tasks this way 
can have an amazing impact on your productivity and motivation.

Instead, prioritize visually. Put the most important thing at the top. When you're 
done with that, the next thing on the list becomes the next most important thing. That way 
you'll only have a single next most important thing to do at a time. And that's enough. 

####  Make tiny decisions

Big decisions are hard to make and hard to change. And once you make one, the 
tendency is to continue believing you made the right decision, even if you didn't. You 
stop being objective. 

Instead, make choices that are small enough that they're effectively temporary. 
When you make tiny decisions, you can't make big mistakes. These small decisions mean 
you can afford to change. There's no big penalty if you mess up. You just fix it.

Polar explorer Ben Saunders said that during his solo North Pole expedition 
(thirty-one marathons back-to-back, seventy-two days alone) the "huge decision" was 
often so horrifically overwhelming to contemplate that his day-to-day decision making 
rarely extended beyond "getting to that bit of ice a few yards in front of me."

Attainable goals like that are the best ones to have. Ones you can actually 
accomplish and build on. You get to say, "We nailed it. Done!" Then you get going on 
the next one. That's a lot more satisfying than some pie-in-the-sky fantasy goal you never 
meet.

## COMPETITORS 

####  Don't copy 

You can steal someone's 
words, images, or code instantly. And that means it's tempting to try to build a business 
by being a copycat. That's a formula for failure, though. The problem with this sort of copying is it 
skips understanding--and understanding is how you grow. You have to understand why 
something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you 
miss that. You just repurpose the last layer instead of understanding all the layers 
underneath.

So much of the work an original creator puts into something is invisible. It's 
buried beneath the surface. The copycat doesn't really know why something looks the way it looks or feels the way it feels or reads the way it reads. The copy is a faux finish. It 
delivers no substance, no understanding, and nothing to base future decisions on.

Plus, if you're a copycat, you can never keep up. You're always in a passive 
position. You never lead; you always follow. You give birth to something that's already 
behind the times--just a knockoff, an inferior version of the original. That's no way to 
live. 
 How do you know if you're copying someone? If someone else is doing the bulk 
of the work, you're copying. Be influenced, but don't steal.

####  Decommoditize your product 

But 
there's a great way to protect yourself from copycats: Make you part of your product or 
service. Inject what's unique about the way you think into what you sell. Decommoditize your product. Make it something no one else can offer.

Look at Zappos.com, a billion-dollar online shoe retailer. A pair of sneakers from 
Zappos is the same as a pair from Foot Locker or any other retailer. But Zappos sets itself 
apart by injecting CEO Tony Hsieh's obsession with customer service into everything it 
does.

Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you 
sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it. Competitors can 
never copy the you in your product. 

####  Pick a fight 

If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you'll find that others 
who agree with you will rally to your side. Being the anti-______ is a great way to 
differentiate yourself and attract followers.

For example, Dunkin' Donuts likes to position itself as the anti-Starbucks. Its ads 
mock Starbucks for using "Fritalian" terms instead of small, medium, and large. Another 
Dunkin' campaign is centered on a taste test in which it beat Starbucks. There's even a 
site called DunkinBeatStarbucks.com where visitors can send e-cards with statements 
like "Friends don't let friends drink Starbucks."

Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers, too. Taking a stand 
always stands out. People get stoked by conflict. They take sides. Passions are ignited. 
And that's a good way to get people to take notice. 

#### Underdo your competition. 

Conventional wisdom says that to beat your competitors, you need to one-up 
them. If they have four features, you need five (or fifteen, or twenty-five). If they're 
spending $20,000, you need to spend $30,000. If they have fifty employees, you need a 
hundred.

When you get 
suckered into an arms race, you wind up in a never-ending battle that costs you massive 
amounts of money, time, and drive. And it forces you to constantly be on the defensive, 
too. Defensive companies can't think ahead; they can only think behind. They don't lead; 
they follow.

So what do you do instead? Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the 
simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition. Instead 
of one-upping, try one-downing. Instead of outdoing, try underdoing.

Don't shy away from the fact that your product or service does less. Highlight it. 
Be proud of it. Sell it as aggressively as competitors sell their extensive feature lists. 

####  Who cares what they're doing? 

In the end, it's not worth paying much attention to the competition anyway. Why 
not? Because worrying about the competition quickly turns into an obsession. 

It's a terrible mindset that leads to stress and anxiety. That state of mind is bad soil for growing anything.

It's a pointless exercise anyway. The competitive landscape changes all the time. 
Your competitor tomorrow may be completely different from your competitor today. It's 
out of your control. What's the point of worrying about things you can't control? 

Focus on yourself instead. What's going on in here is way more important than 
what's going on out there. When you spend time worrying about someone else, you can't 
spend that time improving yourself.

Don't ask yourself whether you're "beating" Apple (or whoever the big boy is in 
your industry). That's the wrong question to ask. It's not a win-or-lose battle. Their profits 
and costs are theirs. Yours are yours.

## EVOLUTION

#### Say no by defaultI 

Start getting into the habit of saying no--even to many of your best ideas. Use the 
power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. But you often 
wind up regretting saying yes. 

People avoid saying no because confrontation makes them uncomfortable. But the 
alternative is even worse. You drag things out, make things complicated, and work on 
ideas you don't believe in.

It's like a relationship: Breaking one up is hard to do, but staying in it just because 
you're too chicken to drop the ax is even worse. Deal with the brief discomfort of 
confrontation up front and avoid the long-term regret

Don't believe that "customer is always right" stuff, either. Let's say you're a chef. 
If enough of your customers say your food is too salty or too hot, you change it. But if a 
few persnickety patrons tell you to add bananas to your lasagna, you're going to turn 
them down, and that's OK. Making a few vocal customers happy isn't worth it if it ruins 
the product for everyone else

Don't be a jerk about saying no, though. Just be honest. If you're not willing to 
yield to a customer request, be polite and explain why. People are surprisingly 
understanding when you take the time to explain your point of view. You may even win 
them over to your way of thinking. If not, recommend a competitor if you think there's a 
better solution out there. It's better to have people be happy using someone else's product 
than disgruntled using yours

Your goal is to make sure your product stays right for you. You're the one who 
has to believe in it most. That way, you can say, "I think you'll love it because I love it."

####  Let your customers outgrow you 

After our first product had been around for a while, we started getting some heat 
from folks who had been with us from the beginning. They said they were starting to 
grow out of the application. Their businesses were changing and they wanted us to 
change our product to mirror their newfound complexity and requirements.

We said no. Here's why: We'd rather our customers grow out of our products 
eventually than never be able to grow into them in the first place. Adding power-user 
features to satisfy some can intimidate those who aren't on board yet. Scaring away new 
customers is worse than losing old customers. 

When you let customers outgrow you, you'll most likely wind up with a product 
that's basic--and that's fine. Small, simple, basic needs are constant. There's an endless 
supply of customers who need exactly that.

And there are always more people who are not using your product than people 
who are. Make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board. That's where your 
continued growth potential lies.

####  Don't confuse enthusiasm with priority 

The enthusiasm you have for a new idea is not an accurate indicator of 
its true worth. What seems like a sure-fire hit right now often gets downgraded to just a 
"nice to have" by morning. And "nice to have" isn't worth putting everything else on 
hold. 

We have ideas for new features all the time. On top of that, we get dozens of 
interesting ideas from customers every day too. Sure, it'd be fun to immediately chase all 
these ideas to see where they lead. But if we did that, we'd just wind up running on a 
treadmill and never get anywhere.

####  Be at-home good 

Smart companies make the opposite: something that's at-home good. When you 
get the product home, you're actually more impressed with it than you were at the store. You live with it and grow to like it more and more. And you tell your friends, too. 

A product that executes on the basics beautifully may not seem as sexy as 
competitors loaded with bells and whistles. Being great at a few things often doesn't look 
all that flashy from afar. That's OK. You're aiming for a long-term relationship, not a 
one-night stand.

This is as true for advertising as it is for in-store packaging or displays. We've all 
seen a TV ad for some "revolutionary" gadget that will change your life. But when the 
actual product arrives in the mail, it turns out to be a disappointment. In-media good isn't 
nearly as important as at-home good. You can't paint over a bad experience with good 
advertising or marketing.

#### Don't write it down 

. Listen, but then 
forget what people said. Seriously. 
 There's no need for a spreadsheet, database, or filing system. The requests that 
really matter are the ones you'll hear over and over. After a while, you won't be able to 
forget them. Your customers will be your memory. They'll keep reminding you. They'll 
show you which things you truly need to worry about.

## PROMOTION

####  Welcome obscurity 

No one knows who you are right now. And that's just fine. Being obscure is a 
great position to be in. Be happy you're in the shadows. Use this time to make mistakes without the whole world hearing about them. 
Keep tweaking. Work out the kinks. Test random ideas. Try new things. No one knows 
you, so it's no big deal if you mess up. Obscurity helps protect your ego and preserve 
your confidence.

Retailers experiment with test markets all the time for this reason. When Dunkin' Donuts thought about selling pizza, hot dogs, and other hot sandwiches, it test-marketed 
the products at just ten select locations.

Would you want the whole world to watch you the first time you do anything? If 
you've never given a speech before, do you want your first speech to be in front of ten 
thousand people or ten people? You don't want everyone to watch you starting your 
business. It makes no sense to tell everyone to look at you if you're not ready to be looked 
at yet.

And keep in mind that once you do get bigger and more popular, you're inevitably 
going to take fewer risks. When you're a success, the pressure to maintain predictability 
and consistency builds. You get more conservative. It's harder to take risks. That's when 
things start to fossilize and change becomes difficult

These early days of obscurity are something you'll miss later on, when you're 
really under the microscope. Now's the time to take risks without worrying about 
embarrassing yourself

####  Build an audience 

All companies have customers. Lucky companies have fans. But the most 
fortunate companies have audiences. An audience can be your secret weapon. 

A lot of businesses still spend big bucks to reach people. Every time they want to 
say something, they dip into their budgets, pull out a huge wad of cash, and place some 
ads. But this approach is both expensive and unreliable. 

Today's smartest companies know better. Instead of going out to reach people, 
you want people to come to you. An audience returns often--on its own--to see what you 
have to say. This is the most receptive group of customers and potential customers you'll 
ever have.

When you build an audience, you don't have to buy people's attention--they give it 
to you. This is a huge advantage. 
 So build an audience. Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos--whatever. Share 
information that's valuable and you'll slowly but surely build a loyal audience. Then 
when you need to get the word out, the right people will already be listening. 

####  Out-teach your competition 

You can advertise. You can hire salespeople. You can sponsor events. But your 
competitors are doing the same things. How does that help you stand out?

Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach 
them. Teaching probably isn't something your competitors are even thinking about. Most 
businesses focus on selling or servicing, but teaching never even occurs to them.

Teach and you'll form a bond you just don't get from traditional marketing tactics. Buying people's attention with a magazine or online banner ad is one thing. Earning their 
loyalty by teaching them forms a whole different connection. They'll trust you more. 
They'll respect you more. Even if they don't use your product, they can still be your fans. 

Teaching is something individuals and small companies can do that bigger 
competitors can't. Big companies can afford a Super Bowl ad; you can't. But you can 
afford to teach, and that's something they'll never do, because big companies are obsessed 
with secrecy. Everything at those places has to get filtered through a lawyer and go 
through layers of red tape. Teaching is your chance to outmaneuver them.

####  Emulate chefs 

They're great chefs, but there are a lot of 
great chefs out there. So why do you know these few better than others? Because they 
share everything they know. They put their recipes in cookbooks and show their 
techniques on cooking shows. 
 As a business owner, you should share everything you know too. This is 
anathema to most in the business world. Businesses are usually paranoid and secretive.

A recipe is much easier to copy than a business. Shouldn't that scare Mario 
Batali? Why would he go on TV and show you how he does what he does? Why would 
he put all his recipes in cookbooks where anyone can buy and replicate them? Because he 
knows those recipes and techniques aren't enough to beat him at his own game. No one's 
going to buy his cookbook, open a restaurant next door, and put him out of business. It 
just doesn't work like that. Yet this is what many in the business world think will happen 
if their competitors learn how they do things. Get over it.

####  Go behind the scenes 

Give people a backstage pass and show them how your business works. Imagine 
that someone wanted to make a reality show about your business. What would they 
share? Now stop waiting for someone else and do it yourself.

Even seemingly boring jobs can be 
fascinating when presented right. What could be more boring than commercial fishing 
and trucking? Yet the Discovery Channel and History Channel have turned these 
professions into highly rated shows: Deadliest Catch and Ice Road Truckers.

It doesn't need to be a dangerous job, either. People love finding out the little 
secrets of all kinds of businesses, even one that makes those tiny marshmallows in 
breakfast cereals. That's why the Food Network's Unwrapped--which explores the secrets 
behind lunch-box treats, soda pop, movie candy, and more--is such a popular program

People are curious about how things are made. It's why they like factory tours or 
behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs. They want to see how the sets are built, how the 
animation is done, how the director cast the film, etc. They want to know how and why 
other people make decisions. 

####  Nobody likes plastic flowers 

The business world is full of "professionals" who wear the uniform and try to 
seem perfect. In truth, they just come off as stiff and boring. No one can relate to people 
like that.

Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to 
real. It's why we like real flowers that wilt, not perfect plastic ones that never change. 
Don't worry about how you're supposed to sound and how you're supposed to act. Show 
the world what you're really like, warts and all.

There's a beauty to imperfection. This is the essence of the Japanese principle of 
wabi-sabi. Wabi-sabi values character and uniqueness over a shiny facade. It teaches that 
cracks and scratches in things should be embraced. It's also about simplicity. You strip 
things down and then use what you have. Leonard Koren, author of a book on wabi-sabi, 
gives this advice: Pare down to the essence, but don't remove the poetry. Keep things 
clean and unencumbered but don't sterilize. *

 It's a beautiful way to put it: Leave the poetry in what you make. When something  becomes too polished, it loses its soul. It seems robotic. 

So talk like you really talk. Reveal things that others are unwilling to discuss. Be 
upfront about your shortcomings. Show the latest version of what you're working on, 
even if you're not done yet. It's OK if it's not perfect. You might not seem as professional, 
but you will seem a lot more genuine. 

####  Press releases are spam 

What do you call a generic pitch sent out to hundreds of strangers hoping that one 
will bite? Spam. That's what press releases are too: generic pitches for coverage sent out 
to hundreds of journalists you don't know, hoping that one will write about you. 
 Let's dissect the purpose of a press release for a moment: It's something you send 
out because you want to be noticed. You want the press to pick up on your new company, 
product, service, announcement, or whatever. You want them to be excited enough to 
write a story about you

If you want to get someone's attention, it's silly to do exactly the same thing as 
everyone else. You need to stand out. So why issue press releases like everyone else 
does? Why spam journalists when their inbox is already filled with other people's spam?

Furthermore, a press release is generic. You write it once and then send it to tons 
of reporters--people whom you don't know and who don't know you. And your first 
introduction is this vague, generic note you also send to everyone else? Is that the 
impression you want to make? Is that really going to get you the story? 

Instead, call someone. Write a personal note. If you read a story about a similar 
company or product, contact the journalist who wrote it. Pitch her with some passion, 
some interest, some life. Do something meaningful. Be remarkable. Stand out. Be 
unforgettable. That's how you'll get the best coverage. 

####  Drug dealers get it right 

Drug dealers are astute businesspeople. They know their product is so good 
they're willing to give a little away for free upfront. They know you'll be back for more--
with money.

Emulate drug dealers. Make your product so good, so addictive, so "can't miss" 
that giving customers a small, free taste makes them come back with cash in hand.

This will force you to make something about your product bite-size. You want an 
easily digestible introduction to what you sell. This gives people a way to try it without 
investing any money or a lot of time.

Bakeries, restaurants, and ice cream shops have done this successfully for years. 
Car dealers let you test-drive cars before buying them. Software firms are also getting on 
board, with free trials or limited-use versions. How many other industries could benefit from the drug-dealer model? 

####  Marketing is not a department 

. Accounting is a department. Marketing isn't. 
Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365. 
 Just as you cannot not communicate, you cannot not market: 
 Every time you answer the phone, it's marketing. 
 Every time you send an e-mail, it's marketing. 
 Every time someone uses your product, it's marketing. 
 Every word you write on your Web site is marketing. 
 If you build software, every error message is marketing. 
 If you're in the restaurant business, the after-dinner mint is marketing. 
 If you're in the retail business, the checkout counter is marketing. 
 If you're in a service business, your invoice is marketing. 
 Recognize that all of these little things are more important than choosing which 
piece of swag to throw into a conference goodie bag. Marketing isn't just a few individual 
events. It's the sum total of everything you do.

####  The myth of the overnight sensation 

You will not be a big hit right away. You will not get rich quick. You are not so 
special that everyone else will instantly pay attention. No one cares about you. At least 
not yet. Get used to it.

You know those overnight-success stories you've heard about? It's not the whole 
story. Dig deeper and you'll usually find people who have busted their asses for years to 
get into a position where things could take off. And on the rare occasion that instant 
success does come along, it usually doesn't last--there's no foundation there to support it. 
 Trade the dream of overnight success for slow, measured growth. It's hard, but 
you have to be patient. You have to grind it out. You have to do it for a long time before 
the right people notice. 
 You may think you can speed up the process by hiring a PR firm. Don't bother. 
You're just not ready for that yet. For one thing, it's too expensive. Good PR firms can 
cost upward of $10,000 per month. That's a waste of money right now. 
 Plus, you're still just a no-name with a product no one's ever heard about. Who's 
going to write about that? Once you have some customers and a history, you'll have a story to tell. But just launching isn't a good story. 

## HIRING

####  Do it yourself first 

Never hire anyone to do a job until you've tried to do it yourself first. That way, 
you'll understand the nature of the work. You'll know what a job well done looks like. 
You'll know how to write a realistic job description and which questions to ask in an 
interview. You'll know whether to hire someone full-time or part-time, outsource it, or 
keep doing it yourself (the last is preferable, if possible).

You'll also be a much better manager, because you'll be supervising people who 
are doing a job you've done before. You'll know when to criticize and when to support.

At 37signals, we didn't hire a system administrator until one of us had spent a 
whole summer setting up a bunch of servers on his own. For the first three years, one of 
us did all of our customer support. Then we hired a dedicated support person. We ran with the ball as far as we could before handing it off. That way, we knew what we were 
looking for once we did decide to hire.

####  Hire when it hurts 

Don't hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain. Always ask yourself: What if we don't 
hire anyone? Is that extra work that's burdening us really necessary? Can we solve the 
problem with a slice of software or a change of practice instead? What if we just don't do 
it? 

Similarly, if you lose someone, don't replace him immediately. See how long you 
can get by without that person and that position. You'll often discover you don't need as 
many people as you think.

The right time to hire is when there's more work than you can handle for a 
sustained period of time. There should be things you can't do anymore. You should notice 
the quality level slipping. That's when you're hurting. And that's when it's time to hire, 
not earlier. 

####  Strangers at a cocktail party 

A small, intimate dinner party among old friends is a different story, though. 
There are genuinely interesting conversations and heated debates. At the end of the night, 
you feel you actually got something out of it. 

Hire a ton of people rapidly and a "strangers at a cocktail party" problem is 
exactly what you end up with. There are always new faces around, so everyone is 
unfailingly polite. Everyone tries to avoid any conflict or drama. No one says, "This idea 
sucks." People appease instead of challenge.

And that appeasement is what gets companies into trouble. You need to be able to 
tell people when they're full of crap. If that doesn't happen, you start churning out 
something that doesn't offend anyone but also doesn't make anyone fall in love. 

You need an environment where everyone feels safe enough to be honest when 
things get tough. You need to know how far you can push someone. You need to know 
what people really mean when they say something. 

####  Resumes are ridiculous 

We all know resumes are a joke. They're exaggerations. They're filled with 
"action verbs" that don't mean anything. They list job titles and responsibilities that are 
vaguely accurate at best. And there's no way to verify most of what's on there. The whole 
thing is a farce

Worst of all, they're too easy. Anyone can create a decent-enough resume. That's 
why half-assed applicants love them so much. They can shotgun out hundreds at a time to 
potential employers. It's another form of spam. They don't care about landing your job; 
they just care about landing any job. 

If someone sends out a resume to three hundred companies, that's a huge red flag 
right there. There's no way that applicant has researched you. There's no way he knows 
what's different about your company. 

If you hire based on this garbage, you're missing the point of what hiring is about. 
You want a specific candidate who cares specifically about your company, your products, 
your customers, and your job.

So how do you find these candidates? First step: Check the cover letter. In a cover 
letter, you get actual communication instead of a list of skills, verbs, and years of 
irrelevance. There's no way an applicant can churn out hundreds of personalized letters. 
That's why the cover letter is a much better test than a resume. You hear someone's actual 
voice and are able recognize if it's in tune with you and your company. 
 Trust your gut reaction. If the first paragraph sucks, the second has to work that 
much harder. If there's no hook in the first three, it's unlikely there's a match there. On the 
other hand, if your gut is telling you there's a chance at a real match, then move on to the 
interview stage

####  Years of irrelevance 

Of course, requiring some baseline level of experience can be a good idea when 
hiring. It makes sense to go after candidates with six months to a year of experience. It 
takes that long to internalize the idioms, learn how things work, understand the relevant 
tools, etc. 
 But after that, the curve flattens out. There's surprisingly little difference between 
a candidate with six months of experience and one with six years. The real difference 
comes from the individual's dedication, personality, and intelligence.

How long someone's been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well they've 
been doing it.

#### Forget about formal education

There are plenty of intelligent people who don't excel in the classroom. 
Don't fall into the trap of thinking you need someone from one of the "best" schools in 
order to get results. Ninety percent of CEOs currently heading the top five hundred 
American companies did not receive undergraduate degrees from Ivy League colleges. 

Too much time in academia can actually do you harm. Take writing, for example. 
When you get out of school, you have to unlearn so much of the way they teach you to 
write there. Some of the misguided lessons you learn in academia: 
 The longer a document is, the more it matters. 
 Stiff, formal tone is better than being conversational. 
 Using big words is impressive. 
 You need to write a certain number of words or pages to make a point. 
 The format matters as much (or more) than the content of what you write. 
 It's no wonder so much business writing winds up dry, wordy, and dripping with 
nonsense. People are just continuing the bad habits they picked up in school. It's not just 
academic writing, either. There are a lot of skills that are useful in academia that aren't 
worth much outside of it.

The pool of great candidates is far bigger than just people who 
completed college with a stellar GPA. Consider dropouts, people who had low GPAs, 
community-college students, and even those who just went to high school.

####  Hire managers of one 

Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. 
They don't need heavy direction. They don't need daily check-ins. They do what a 
manager would do--set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc.--but 
they do it by themselves and for themselves.

 These people free you from oversight. They set their own direction. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they've gotten done. They don't need 
a lot of hand-holding or supervision.

How can you spot these people? Look at their backgrounds. They have set the 
tone for how they've worked at other jobs. They've run something on their own or 
launched some kind of project. 

You want someone who's capable of building something from scratch and seeing 
it through. Finding these people frees the rest of your team to work more and manage 
less.

####  Test-drive employees 

Interviews are only worth so much. Some people sound like pros but don't work 
like pros. You need to evaluate the work they can do now, not the work they say they did 
in the past.

The best way to do that is to actually see them work. Hire them for a miniproject, 
even if it's for just twenty or forty hours. You'll see how they make decisions. You'll see 
if you get along. You'll see what kind of questions they ask. You'll get to judge them by 
their actions instead of just their words. 

th comes out. It's one thing to look at a portfolio, read a resume, or conduct an 
interview. It's another to actually work with someone.

## DAMAGE CONTROL 

####  Own your bad news 

When something goes wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You'll be better 
off if it's you. Otherwise, you create an opportunity for rumors, hearsay, and false 
information to spread.

When something bad happens, tell your customers (even if they never noticed in 
the first place). Don't think you can just sweep it under the rug. You can't hide anymore. 
These days, someone else will call you on it if you don't do it yourself. They'll post about 
it online and everyone will know. There are no more secrets.

Here are some tips on how you can own the story: 
 The message should come from the top. The highest-ranking person available 
should take control in a forceful way. 
 Spread the message far and wide. Use whatever megaphone you have. Don't try to 
sweep it under the rug. 
 "No comment" is not an option. 
 Apologize the way a real person would and explain what happened in detail. 
 Honestly be concerned about the fate of your customers--then prove it. 

####  Speed changes everything 

Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do 
when it comes to customer service. It's amazing how much that can defuse a bad situation 
and turn it into a good one. 
 Have you ever sent an e-mail and it took days or weeks for the company to get 
back to you? How did it make you feel? These days, that's what people have come to 
expect. They're used to being put on hold. They're used to platitudes about "caring" that 
aren't backed up.

That's why so many support queries start off with an antagonistic tone. Some 
people may even make threats or call you names. Don't take it personally. They think that's the only way to be heard. They're only trying to be a squeaky wheel in hopes it'll 
get them a little grease. 

Once you answer quickly, they shift 180 degrees. They light up. They become 
extra polite. Often they thank you profusely

It's especially true if you offer a personal response. Customers are so used to 
canned answers, you can really differentiate yourself by answering thoughtfully and 
showing that you're listening. And even if you don't have a perfect answer, say 
something. "Let me do some research and get back to you" can work wonders. 

####  How to say you're sorry 

There's never really a great way to say you're sorry, but there are plenty of terrible 
ways. One of the worst ways is the non-apology apology, which sounds like an apology but doesn't really accept any blame. For example, "We're sorry if this upset you." Or "I'm 
sorry that you don't feel we lived up to your expectations." Whatever.

A good apology accepts responsibility. It has no conditional if phrase attached. It 
shows people that the buck stops with you. And then it provides real details about what 
happened and what you're doing to prevent it from happening again. And it seeks a way 
to make things right.

_"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused."_

- "We apologize": You don't say "We apologize" to people if you spill their coffee. You say "I'm sorry". Use the appropriate tone and language to show that you understand the severity of what happened. "I" is stronger than "we".
- "Any inconvenience": It's not an inconvenience. It's a crisis.
- "This may have caused": "May" implies there might not be anything wrong at all, when obviously something is.

So what's the perfect way to say you're sorry? There's no magic bullet. Any stock 
answer will sound generic and hollow. You're going to have to take it on a case-by-case 
basis.

The number-one principle to keep in mind when you apologize: How would you 
feel about the apology if you were on the other end? If someone said those words to you, 
would you believe them? 

Keep in mind that you can't apologize your way out of being an ass. Even the best 
apology won't rescue you if you haven't earned people's trust. Everything you do before 
things go wrong matters far more than the actual words you use to apologize. If you've 
built rapport with customers, they'll cut you some slack and trust you when you say 
you're sorry. 

####  Put everyone on the front lines 

Cooking schools and smart restaurateurs know it's 
important for both sides to understand and empathize with each other. That's why they 
often have chefs work out front as waiters for a stretch. That way, the kitchen staff can 
interact with customers and see what it's actually like on the front lines.

A lot of companies have a similar front-of-house/back-of-house split. The people 
who make the product work in the "kitchen" while support handles the customers. 
Unfortunately, that means the product's chefs never get to directly hear what customers 
are saying. Too bad. Listening to customers is the best way to get in tune with a product's 
strengths and weaknesses.

The more people you have between your 
customers' words and the people doing the work, the more likely it is that the message 
will get lost or distorted along the way.

Everyone on your team should be connected to your customers--maybe not every 
day, but at least a few times throughout the year. That's the only way your team is going 
to feel the hurt your customers are experiencing. It's feeling the hurt that really motivates 
people to fix the problem. And the flip side is true too: The joy of happy customers or 
ones who have had a problem solved can also be wildly motivating. 

So don't protect the people doing the work from customer feedback. No one 
should be shielded from direct criticism.

Maybe you think you don't have time to interact with customers. Then make time. 
Craigslist founder Craig Newmark still answers support e-mails today (often within 
minutes). He also deletes racist comments from the site's discussion boards and pesters 
New York City Realtors who post apartments for rent that don't exist.* If he can devote 
this kind of attention to customer service, you can too. 

####  Take a deep breath 

When you rock the boat, there will be waves. After you introduce a new feature, 
change a policy, or remove something, knee-jerk reactions will pour in. Resist the urge to 
panic or make rapid changes in response. Passions flare in the beginning. That's normal. 
But if you ride out that first rocky week, things usually settle down.

Also, remember that negative reactions are almost always louder and more 
passionate than positive ones. In fact, you may hear only negative voices even when the 
majority of your customers are happy about a change. Make sure you don't foolishly 
backpedal on a necessary but controversial decision.

So when people complain, let things simmer for a while. Let them know you're 
listening. Show them you're aware of what they're saying. Let them know you understand 
their discontent. But explain that you're going to let it go for a while and see what 
happens. You'll probably find that people will adjust eventually.

## CULTURE

####  You don't create a culture 

Instant cultures are artificial cultures. They're big bangs made of mission 
statements, declarations, and rules. They are obvious, ugly, and plastic. Artificial culture 
is paint. Real culture is patina. 
 You don't create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don't have a 
culture. Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior. If you encourage people to share, 
then sharing will be built into your culture. If you reward trust, then trust will be built in. 
If you treat customers right, then treating customers right becomes your culture

Culture isn't a foosball table or trust falls. It isn't policy. It isn't the Christmas 
party or the company picnic. Those are objects and events, not culture. And it's not a 
slogan, either. Culture is action, not words.

So don't worry too much about it. Don't force it. You can't install a culture. Like a fine scotch, you've got to give it time to develop. 

####  Decisions are temporary 

"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?" 
 Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real 
problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.

Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot 
down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that 
whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end. It's just not so, especially for a 
small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are 
temporary

At this stage, it's silly to worry about whether or not your concept will scale from 
five to five thousand people (or from a hundred thousand to 100 million people). Getting 
a product or service off the ground is hard enough without inventing even more obstacles. 
Optimize for now and worry about the future later

The ability to change course is one of the big advantages of being small. 
Compared with larger competitors, you're way more capable of making quick, sweeping 
changes. Big companies just can't move that fast. So pay attention to today and worry 
about later when it gets here. Otherwise you'll waste energy, time, and money fixating on 
problems that may never materialize. 

####  Skip the rock stars 

Instead of thinking about how you can land a roomful of rock stars, think about 
the room instead. We're all capable of bad, average, and great work. The environment has 
a lot more to do with great work than most people realize. 
 That's not to say we're all created equal and you'll unlock star power in anyone 
with a rock star environment. But there's a ton of untapped potential trapped under lame 
policies, poor direction, and stifling bureaucracies. Cut the crap and you'll find that 
people are waiting to do great work. They just need to be given the chance. 
 This isn't about casual Fridays or bring-your-dog-to-work day. (If those are such 
good things, then why aren't you doing them every day of the week?) 
 Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility. They're 
a result of giving people the privacy, workspace, and tools they deserve. Great 
environments show respect for the people who do the work and how they do it. 

####  They're not thirteen 

When you treat people like children, you get children's work. Yet that's exactly 
how a lot of companies and managers treat their employees. Employees need to ask 
permission before they can do anything. They need to get approval for every tiny 
expenditure. It's surprising they don't have to get a hall pass to go take a shit.

When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of nonthinkers. 
You create a boss-versus-worker relationship that screams, "I don't trust you."

What do you gain if you ban employees from, say, visiting a social-networking 
site or watching YouTube while at work? You gain nothing. That time doesn't magically 
convert to work. They'll just find some other diversion.

And look, you're not going to get a full eight hours a day out of people anyway. 
That's a myth. They might be at the office for eight hours, but they're not actually 
working eight hours. People need diversions. It helps disrupt the monotony of the 
workday. A little YouTube or Facebook time never hurt anyone. 

Then there's all the money and time you spend policing this stuff. How much does 
it cost to set up surveillance software? How much time do IT employees waste on monitoring other employees instead of working on a project that's actually valuable? 

####  Send people home at 5 

The dream employee for a lot of companies is a twenty-something with as little of 
a life as possible outside of work--someone who'll be fine working fourteen-hour days 
and sleeping under his desk. 
 But packing a room full of these burn-the-midnight-oil types isn't as great as it 
seems. It lets you get away with lousy execution. It perpetuates myths like "This is the 
only way we can compete against the big guys." You don't need more hours; you need 
better hours.

When people have something to do at home, they get down to business. They get their work done at the office because they have somewhere else to be. They find ways to 
be more efficient because they have to. They need to pick up the kids or get to choir 
practice. So they use their time wisely

As the saying goes, "If you want something done, ask the busiest person you 
know." You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care 
about more than one thing. You shouldn't expect the job to be someone's entire life--at 
least not if you want to keep them around for a long time.

####  Don't scar on the first cut 

The second something goes wrong, the natural tendency is to create a policy. 
"Someone's wearing shorts!? We need a dress code!" No, you don't. You just need to tell 
John not to wear shorts again.

 Policies are organizational scar tissue. They are codified overreactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again. They are collective punishment for the 
misdeeds of an individual. 
 This is how bureaucracies are born. No one sets out to create a bureaucracy. They 
sneak up on companies slowly. They are created one policy--one scar--at a time. 
 So don't scar on the first cut. Don't create a policy because one person did 
something wrong once. Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over 
again. 

####  Sound like you 

What is it with businesspeople trying to sound big? The stiff language, the formal 
announcements, the artificial friendliness, the legalese, etc. You read this stuff and it 
sounds like a robot wrote it. These companies talk at you, not to you.

This mask of professionalism is a joke. We all know this. Yet small companies 
still try to emulate it. They think sounding big makes them appear bigger and more 
"professional." But it really just makes them sound ridiculous. Plus, you sacrifice one of a 
small company's greatest assets: the ability to communicate simply and directly, without 
running every last word through a legal-and PR-department sieve.

There's nothing wrong with sounding your own size. Being honest about who you 
are is smart business, too. Language is often your first impression--why start it off with a 
lie? Don't be afraid to be you. 

Talk to customers the way you would to 
friends. Explain things as if you were sitting next to them. Avoid jargon or any sort of 
corporate-speak. Stay away from buzzwords when normal words will do just fine. Don't 
talk about "monetization" or being "transparent;" talk about making money and being 
honest. Don't use seven words when four will do.

And don't force your employees to end e-mails with legalese like "This e-mail 
message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and 
privileged information." That's like ending all your company e-mails with a signature that 
says, "We don't trust you and we're ready to prove it in court." Good luck making friends 
that way.

Write to be read, don't write just to write. Whenever you write something, read it 
out loud. Does it sound the way it would if you were actually talking to someone? If not, 
how can you make it more conversational? 
 Who said writing needs to be formal? Who said you have to strip away your 
personality when putting words on paper? Forget rules. Communicate! 
 And when you're writing, don't think about all the people who may read your 
words. Think of one person. Then write for that one person. Writing for a mob leads to 
generalities and awkwardness. When you write to a specific target, you're a lot more 
likely to hit the mark. 

####  Four-letter words 

There are four-letter words you should never use in business. They're not fuck or 
shit. They're need, must, can't, easy, just, only, and fast. These words get in the way of 
healthy communication. They are red flags

When you use these four-letter words, you create a black-and-white situation. But 
the truth is rarely black and white. So people get upset and problems ensue. Tension and 
conflict are injected unnecessarily. 

Here's what's wrong with some of them:Need. Very few things actually need to 
get done. Instead of saying "need," you're better off saying "maybe" or "What do you 
think about this?" or "How does this sound?" or "Do you think we could get away with 
that?" Can't. When you say "can't," you probably can. Sometimes there are even opposing can'ts: "We can't launch it like that, because it's not quite right" versus "We 
can't spend any more time on this because we have to launch." Both of those statements 
can't be true. Or wait a minute, can they? Easy. Easy is a word that's used to describe 
other people's jobs. "That should be easy for you to do, right?" But notice how rarely 
people describe their own tasks as easy. For you, it's "Let me look into it"--but for others, 
it's "Get it done." 

These four-letter words often pop up during debates (and also watch out for their 
cousins: everyone, no one, always, and never). Once uttered, they make it tough to find a 
solution. They box you into a corner by pitting two absolutes against each other. That's 
when head-butting occurs. You squeeze out any middle ground.

And these words are especially dangerous when you string them together: "We 
need to add this feature now. We can't launch without this feature. Everyone wants it. It's 
only one little thing so it will be easy. You should be able to get it in there fast!" Only 
thirty-six words, but a hundred assumptions. That's a recipe for disaster.

## CONCLUSION 

####  Inspiration is perishable 

We all have ideas. Ideas are immortal. They last forever. 
 What doesn't last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It 
has an expiration date. 
 If you want to do something, you've got to do it now. You can't put it on a shelf 
and wait two months to get around to it. You can't just say you'll do it later. Later, you 
won't be pumped up about it anymore. 
 If you're inspired on a Friday, swear off the weekend and dive into the project. 
When you're high on inspiration, you can get two weeks of work done in twenty-four 
hours. Inspiration is a time machine in that way. 
 Inspiration is a magical thing, a productivity multiplier, a motivator. But it won't 
wait for you. Inspiration is a now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to 
work.
