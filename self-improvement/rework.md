## Rework

1. Ignore the real world: The real world isn't a place, it's an excuse. It's a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.
2. Learning from mistakes is overrated: You need to learn from your mistakes. You might learn what not to do again, but how valuable is that? Success gives you real ammunition. When something succeeds, you know what worked--and you can do it again. You still don't know what you should do next. Success is the experience that actually counts.
3. Planning is guessing. Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses, and your strategic plans as strategic guesses. Now you can stop worrying about them as much. They just aren't worth the stress. It's OK to wing it.
4. Why grow? Why is expansion always the goal? Grow slow and see what feels right--premature hiring is the death of many companies.
5. Workaholism. Working more doesn't mean you care more or get more done. It just means you work more. It is not sustainable. Workaholics don't save the day, they just use it up.
6. Make a dent in the universe. This is your life's work. Do you want to build just another me-too product or do you want to shake things up? What you do is your legacy.
7. Scratch your own itch. When you build a product or service, you make the call on hundreds of tiny decisions each day. If you're solving someone else's problem, you're constantly stabbing in the dark. When you solve your own problem, the light comes on. You know exactly what the right answer is.
8. Draw a line in the sand. A strong stand is how you attract superfans. You'll turn some people off. That's life. We're willing to lose some customers if it means that others love our products intensely. That's our line in the sand.
9. Outside money is Plan Z. We're in a service economy now. If you're running a business like that, avoid outside funding. Spending other people's money may sound great, but there's a noose attached. Here's why: You give up control. "Cashing out" begins to trump building a quality business. You wind up building what investors want instead of what customers want. Raising money is incredibly distracting. Seeking funding is difficult and draining.
10. You need less than you think. There's nothing wrong with being frugal. When we launched our first product, we did it on the cheap. We didn't get our own office; we shared space with another company. We didn't get a bank of servers; we had only one. We didn't advertise; we promoted by sharing our experiences online. We didn't hire someone to answer customer e-mails; the company founder answered them himself. And everything worked out just fine. Great companies start in garages all the time. Yours can too. 
11. Building to flip is building to flop. You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. If your whole strategy is based on leaving, chances are you won't get far in the first place. Move to an island and sip pina coladas all day? Will that really satisfy you? Will money alone truly make you happy? Are you sure you'll like that more than running a business you actually enjoy and believe in? That's why you often hear about business owners who sell out, retire for six months, and then get back in the game. They miss the thing they gave away.
12. Less mass. Long-term contracts, excess staff, permanent decisions, meetings, thick process, inventory (physical or mental), hardware, software, and technology lock-ins, long-term road maps, office politics. Avoid these things whenever you can. That way, you'll be able to change direction easily.
13. Less is a Good Thing. Embrace constraints. Limited resources force you to make do with what you've got. There's no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative. We make sure to have only one or two people working on a product at a time. And we always keep features to a minimum.
14. Build half a product, not a half-assed product. You can turn a bunch of great ideas into a crappy product real fast by trying to do them all at once. You just can't do everything you want to do and do it well.
15. Start at the epicenter. There's the stuff you could do, the stuff you want to do, and the stuff you have to do. The stuff you have to do is where you should begin. So ignore the details--for a while. Nail the basics first and worry about the specifics later.
16. Making the call is making progress. Whenever you can, swap "Let's think about it" for "Let's decide on it." Commit to making decisions. You can't build on top of "We'll decide later," but you can build on top of "Done." Long projects zap morale. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch. Make the call, make progress, and get something out now--while you've got the motivation and momentum to do so.
17. Be a curator. What makes a museum great is the stuff that's not on the walls. Someone says no. It's the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, simplify, and streamline.
18. Throw less at the problem. When things aren't working, the natural inclination is to throw more at the problem. That's a fool's path. You start focusing on fashion instead of substance. The core of your business should be built around things that won't change.
19. Tone is in your fingers. In business, too many people obsess over tools, software tricks, scaling issues, fancy office space, lavish furniture, and other frivolities instead of what really matters. And what really matters is how to actually get customers and make money.
20. Sell your by-products. When you make something, you always make something else. You can't make just one thing. Everything has a by-product. Software companies don't usually think about writing books. Bands don't usually think about filming the recording process. Car manufacturers don't usually think about selling charcoal. There's probably something you haven't thought about that you could sell too.
21. Launch now. If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out? Funny how a question like that forces you to focus. Don't mistake this approach for skimping on quality, either. You still want to make something great. This approach just recognizes that the best way to get there is through iterations.

## Productivity

####  Reasons to quit: Ask yourself these questions:

- Why are you doing this? What is this for? Who benefits? What's the motivation behind it?
- What problem are you solving? What's the problem? Are cx confused, or is there something not clear enough?
- Is this actually useful? Are you making somehting useful or just making something? It's easy to confuse enthusiasm with usefulness.
- Are you adding value? Adding something is easy; adding value is hard. Is this thing you're working on actually making your product valuable for cx? Can they get mor out of it than before?
- Will this change behavior?
- Is there an easier way?
- What could you be doing instead?
- Is it really worth it? Is the meeting worth pulling 6 people off work? Is it worth pulling an all-nighter, or could you just finish it tomorrow? Is it worth getting stressed over a competitor's press release? It it worth spending your money on advertising?

####  Meetings are toxic 

The worst interruptions of all are meetings. Here's why: 

- They're usually about words and abstract concepts, not real things. 
- They usually convey an abysmally small amount of information per minute.
- They drift off-subject easier than a Chicago cab in a snowstorm. 
- They require thorough preparation that most people don't have time for. 
- They frequently have agendas so vague that nobody is really sure of the goal.- They often include at least one moron who inevitably gets his turn to waste everyone's time with nonsense. 

When you think about it, the true cost of meetings is staggering. Let's say you're going to schedule a meeting that lasts one hour, and you invite ten people to attend. That's actually a ten-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting. You're trading ten hours of productivity for one hour of meeting time.

#### Fixing a Meeting

- Set a timer. When it rings, meeting's over. Period. 
- Invite as few people as possible. 
- Always have a clear agenda. 
- Begin with a specific problem. 
- Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes. 
- End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it. 

1. Illusions of agreement. If you need to explain something, try getting real with it. Instead of describing what something looks like, draw it. That's why you want to get to something real right away. That's when you get true understanding. Get the chisel out and start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction.
2. Interruption is the enemy of productivity. When do you get most of your work done? If you're like most people, it's at night or early in the morning. It's no coincidence that these are the times when nobody else is around. Interruption is not collaboration, it's just interruption. And when you're interrupted, you're not getting work done. You can't get meaningful things done when you're constantly going start, stop, start, stop.
3. Good enough is fine. Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. Judo solutions are all about getting the most out of doing the least. When good enough gets the job done, go for it.
4. Quick wins. The way you build momentum is by getting something done and then moving on to the next thing. No one likes to be stuck on an endless project with no finish line in sight. __The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it.__ If you absolutely have to work on long-term projects, try to dedicate one day a week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm.
5. Don't be a hero. Sometimes that kind of sheer effort overload works. But is it worth it? Probably not. So we decided that if anything takes one of us longer than two weeks, we've got to bring other people in to take a look. If you already spent too much time on something that wasn't worth it, walk away. You can't get that time back. The worst thing you can do now is waste even more time.
6. Your estimates suck. Reality never sticks to best-case scenarios. That's why estimates that stretch weeks, months, and years into the future are fantasies. Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate.
7. Long lists don't get done. Long lists collect dust. Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it. For example, break a single list of a hundred items into ten lists of ten items. Yes, you still have the same amount of stuff left to do. But now you can look at the small picture and find satisfaction, motivation, and progress.
8. Make tiny decisions. When you make tiny decisions, you can't make big mistakes. These small decisions mean you can afford to change. There's no big penalty if you mess up. You just fix it. Attainable goals like that are the best ones to have. Ones you can actually accomplish and build on. You get to say, "We nailed it. Done!"

## COMPETITORS 

1. Don't copy. It's tempting to try to build a business by being a copycat. That's a formula for failure, though. The problem with this sort of copying is it skips understanding--and understanding is how you grow. You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that. You just repurpose the last layer instead of understanding all the layers underneath.

So much of the work an original creator puts into something is invisible. It's buried beneath the surface. The copycat doesn't really know why something looks the way it looks or feels the way it feels or reads the way it reads. The copy is a faux finish. It delivers no substance, no understanding, and nothing to base future decisions on.

Plus, if you're a copycat, you can never keep up. You're always in a passive position. You never lead; you always follow. You give birth to something that's already behind the times--just a knockoff, an inferior version of the original. That's no way to live. 

How do you know if you're copying someone? If someone else is doing the bulk of the work, you're copying. Be influenced, but don't steal.

####  Decommoditize your product 

But there's a great way to protect yourself from copycats: Make you part of your product or service. Inject what's unique about the way you think into what you sell. Decommoditize your product. Make it something no one else can offer.

Look at Zappos.com, a billion-dollar online shoe retailer. A pair of sneakers from Zappos is the same as a pair from Foot Locker or any other retailer. But Zappos sets itself apart by injecting CEO Tony Hsieh's obsession with customer service into everything it does.

Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it. Competitors can never copy the you in your product. 

####  Pick a fight 

If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you'll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side. Being the anti-______ is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers.

For example, Dunkin' Donuts likes to position itself as the anti-Starbucks. Its ads mock Starbucks for using "Fritalian" terms instead of small, medium, and large. Another Dunkin' campaign is centered on a taste test in which it beat Starbucks. There's even a site called DunkinBeatStarbucks.com where visitors can send e-cards with statements like "Friends don't let friends drink Starbucks."

Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers, too. Taking a stand always stands out. People get stoked by conflict. They take sides. Passions are ignited. And that's a good way to get people to take notice. 

#### Underdo your competition. 

Conventional wisdom says that to beat your competitors, you need to one-up them. If they have four features, you need five (or fifteen, or twenty-five). If they're spending $20,000, you need to spend $30,000. If they have fifty employees, you need a hundred.

When you get suckered into an arms race, you wind up in a never-ending battle that costs you massive amounts of money, time, and drive. And it forces you to constantly be on the defensive, too. Defensive companies can't think ahead; they can only think behind. They don't lead; they follow.

So what do you do instead? Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition. Instead of one-upping, try one-downing. Instead of outdoing, try underdoing.

Don't shy away from the fact that your product or service does less. Highlight it. Be proud of it. Sell it as aggressively as competitors sell their extensive feature lists. 

####  Who cares what they're doing? 

In the end, it's not worth paying much attention to the competition anyway. Why not? Because worrying about the competition quickly turns into an obsession. 

It's a terrible mindset that leads to stress and anxiety. That state of mind is bad soil for growing anything.

It's a pointless exercise anyway. The competitive landscape changes all the time. Your competitor tomorrow may be completely different from your competitor today. It's out of your control. What's the point of worrying about things you can't control? 

Focus on yourself instead. What's going on in here is way more important than what's going on out there. When you spend time worrying about someone else, you can't spend that time improving yourself.

Don't ask yourself whether you're "beating" Apple (or whoever the big boy is in your industry). That's the wrong question to ask. It's not a win-or-lose battle. Their profits and costs are theirs. Yours are yours.

## EVOLUTION

#### Say no by default

Start getting into the habit of saying no--even to many of your best ideas. Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. But you often wind up regretting saying yes. 

People avoid saying no because confrontation makes them uncomfortable. But the alternative is even worse. You drag things out, make things complicated, and work on ideas you don't believe in.

It's like a relationship: Breaking one up is hard to do, but staying in it just because you're too chicken to drop the ax is even worse. Deal with the brief discomfort of 
confrontation up front and avoid the long-term regret

Don't believe that "customer is always right" stuff, either. Let's say you're a chef. 
If enough of your customers say your food is too salty or too hot, you change it. But if a 
few persnickety patrons tell you to add bananas to your lasagna, you're going to turn 
them down, and that's OK. Making a few vocal customers happy isn't worth it if it ruins 
the product for everyone else

Don't be a jerk about saying no, though. Just be honest. If you're not willing to 
yield to a customer request, be polite and explain why. People are surprisingly 
understanding when you take the time to explain your point of view. You may even win 
them over to your way of thinking. If not, recommend a competitor if you think there's a 
better solution out there. It's better to have people be happy using someone else's product 
than disgruntled using yours

Your goal is to make sure your product stays right for you. You're the one who 
has to believe in it most. That way, you can say, "I think you'll love it because I love it."

####  Let your customers outgrow you 

After our first product had been around for a while, we started getting some heat 
from folks who had been with us from the beginning. They said they were starting to 
grow out of the application. Their businesses were changing and they wanted us to 
change our product to mirror their newfound complexity and requirements.

We said no. Here's why: We'd rather our customers grow out of our products 
eventually than never be able to grow into them in the first place. Adding power-user 
features to satisfy some can intimidate those who aren't on board yet. Scaring away new 
customers is worse than losing old customers. 

When you let customers outgrow you, you'll most likely wind up with a product 
that's basic--and that's fine. Small, simple, basic needs are constant. There's an endless 
supply of customers who need exactly that.

And there are always more people who are not using your product than people 
who are. Make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board. That's where your 
continued growth potential lies.

####  Don't confuse enthusiasm with priority 

The enthusiasm you have for a new idea is not an accurate indicator of 
its true worth. What seems like a sure-fire hit right now often gets downgraded to just a 
"nice to have" by morning. And "nice to have" isn't worth putting everything else on 
hold. 

We have ideas for new features all the time. On top of that, we get dozens of 
interesting ideas from customers every day too. Sure, it'd be fun to immediately chase all 
these ideas to see where they lead. But if we did that, we'd just wind up running on a 
treadmill and never get anywhere.

####  Be at-home good 

Smart companies make the opposite: something that's at-home good. When you 
get the product home, you're actually more impressed with it than you were at the store. You live with it and grow to like it more and more. And you tell your friends, too. 

A product that executes on the basics beautifully may not seem as sexy as 
competitors loaded with bells and whistles. Being great at a few things often doesn't look 
all that flashy from afar. That's OK. You're aiming for a long-term relationship, not a 
one-night stand.

This is as true for advertising as it is for in-store packaging or displays. We've all 
seen a TV ad for some "revolutionary" gadget that will change your life. But when the 
actual product arrives in the mail, it turns out to be a disappointment. In-media good isn't 
nearly as important as at-home good. You can't paint over a bad experience with good 
advertising or marketing.

#### Don't write it down 

. Listen, but then 
forget what people said. Seriously. 
 There's no need for a spreadsheet, database, or filing system. The requests that 
really matter are the ones you'll hear over and over. After a while, you won't be able to 
forget them. Your customers will be your memory. They'll keep reminding you. They'll 
show you which things you truly need to worry about.

## PROMOTION

####  Welcome obscurity 

No one knows who you are right now. And that's just fine. Being obscure is a 
great position to be in. Be happy you're in the shadows. Use this time to make mistakes without the whole world hearing about them. 
Keep tweaking. Work out the kinks. Test random ideas. Try new things. No one knows 
you, so it's no big deal if you mess up. Obscurity helps protect your ego and preserve 
your confidence.

Retailers experiment with test markets all the time for this reason. When Dunkin' Donuts thought about selling pizza, hot dogs, and other hot sandwiches, it test-marketed 
the products at just ten select locations.

Would you want the whole world to watch you the first time you do anything? If 
you've never given a speech before, do you want your first speech to be in front of ten 
thousand people or ten people? You don't want everyone to watch you starting your 
business. It makes no sense to tell everyone to look at you if you're not ready to be looked 
at yet.

And keep in mind that once you do get bigger and more popular, you're inevitably 
going to take fewer risks. When you're a success, the pressure to maintain predictability 
and consistency builds. You get more conservative. It's harder to take risks. That's when 
things start to fossilize and change becomes difficult

These early days of obscurity are something you'll miss later on, when you're 
really under the microscope. Now's the time to take risks without worrying about 
embarrassing yourself

####  Build an audience 

All companies have customers. Lucky companies have fans. But the most 
fortunate companies have audiences. An audience can be your secret weapon. 

A lot of businesses still spend big bucks to reach people. Every time they want to 
say something, they dip into their budgets, pull out a huge wad of cash, and place some 
ads. But this approach is both expensive and unreliable. 

Today's smartest companies know better. Instead of going out to reach people, 
you want people to come to you. An audience returns often--on its own--to see what you 
have to say. This is the most receptive group of customers and potential customers you'll 
ever have.

When you build an audience, you don't have to buy people's attention--they give it 
to you. This is a huge advantage. 
 So build an audience. Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos--whatever. Share 
information that's valuable and you'll slowly but surely build a loyal audience. Then 
when you need to get the word out, the right people will already be listening. 

####  Out-teach your competition 

You can advertise. You can hire salespeople. You can sponsor events. But your 
competitors are doing the same things. How does that help you stand out?

Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach 
them. Teaching probably isn't something your competitors are even thinking about. Most 
businesses focus on selling or servicing, but teaching never even occurs to them.

Teach and you'll form a bond you just don't get from traditional marketing tactics. Buying people's attention with a magazine or online banner ad is one thing. Earning their 
loyalty by teaching them forms a whole different connection. They'll trust you more. 
They'll respect you more. Even if they don't use your product, they can still be your fans. 

Teaching is something individuals and small companies can do that bigger 
competitors can't. Big companies can afford a Super Bowl ad; you can't. But you can 
afford to teach, and that's something they'll never do, because big companies are obsessed 
with secrecy. Everything at those places has to get filtered through a lawyer and go 
through layers of red tape. Teaching is your chance to outmaneuver them.

####  Emulate chefs 

They're great chefs, but there are a lot of 
great chefs out there. So why do you know these few better than others? Because they 
share everything they know. They put their recipes in cookbooks and show their 
techniques on cooking shows. 
 As a business owner, you should share everything you know too. This is 
anathema to most in the business world. Businesses are usually paranoid and secretive.

A recipe is much easier to copy than a business. Shouldn't that scare Mario 
Batali? Why would he go on TV and show you how he does what he does? Why would 
he put all his recipes in cookbooks where anyone can buy and replicate them? Because he 
knows those recipes and techniques aren't enough to beat him at his own game. No one's 
going to buy his cookbook, open a restaurant next door, and put him out of business. It 
just doesn't work like that. Yet this is what many in the business world think will happen 
if their competitors learn how they do things. Get over it.

####  Go behind the scenes 

Give people a backstage pass and show them how your business works. Imagine 
that someone wanted to make a reality show about your business. What would they 
share? Now stop waiting for someone else and do it yourself.

Even seemingly boring jobs can be 
fascinating when presented right. What could be more boring than commercial fishing 
and trucking? Yet the Discovery Channel and History Channel have turned these 
professions into highly rated shows: Deadliest Catch and Ice Road Truckers.

It doesn't need to be a dangerous job, either. People love finding out the little 
secrets of all kinds of businesses, even one that makes those tiny marshmallows in 
breakfast cereals. That's why the Food Network's Unwrapped--which explores the secrets 
behind lunch-box treats, soda pop, movie candy, and more--is such a popular program

People are curious about how things are made. It's why they like factory tours or 
behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs. They want to see how the sets are built, how the 
animation is done, how the director cast the film, etc. They want to know how and why 
other people make decisions. 

####  Nobody likes plastic flowers 

The business world is full of "professionals" who wear the uniform and try to 
seem perfect. In truth, they just come off as stiff and boring. No one can relate to people 
like that.

Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to 
real. It's why we like real flowers that wilt, not perfect plastic ones that never change. 
Don't worry about how you're supposed to sound and how you're supposed to act. Show 
the world what you're really like, warts and all.

There's a beauty to imperfection. This is the essence of the Japanese principle of 
wabi-sabi. Wabi-sabi values character and uniqueness over a shiny facade. It teaches that 
cracks and scratches in things should be embraced. It's also about simplicity. You strip 
things down and then use what you have. Leonard Koren, author of a book on wabi-sabi, 
gives this advice: Pare down to the essence, but don't remove the poetry. Keep things 
clean and unencumbered but don't sterilize. *

 It's a beautiful way to put it: Leave the poetry in what you make. When something  becomes too polished, it loses its soul. It seems robotic. 

So talk like you really talk. Reveal things that others are unwilling to discuss. Be 
upfront about your shortcomings. Show the latest version of what you're working on, 
even if you're not done yet. It's OK if it's not perfect. You might not seem as professional, 
but you will seem a lot more genuine. 

####  Press releases are spam 

What do you call a generic pitch sent out to hundreds of strangers hoping that one 
will bite? Spam. That's what press releases are too: generic pitches for coverage sent out 
to hundreds of journalists you don't know, hoping that one will write about you. 
 Let's dissect the purpose of a press release for a moment: It's something you send 
out because you want to be noticed. You want the press to pick up on your new company, 
product, service, announcement, or whatever. You want them to be excited enough to 
write a story about you

If you want to get someone's attention, it's silly to do exactly the same thing as 
everyone else. You need to stand out. So why issue press releases like everyone else 
does? Why spam journalists when their inbox is already filled with other people's spam?

Furthermore, a press release is generic. You write it once and then send it to tons 
of reporters--people whom you don't know and who don't know you. And your first 
introduction is this vague, generic note you also send to everyone else? Is that the 
impression you want to make? Is that really going to get you the story? 

Instead, call someone. Write a personal note. If you read a story about a similar 
company or product, contact the journalist who wrote it. Pitch her with some passion, 
some interest, some life. Do something meaningful. Be remarkable. Stand out. Be 
unforgettable. That's how you'll get the best coverage. 

####  Drug dealers get it right 

Drug dealers are astute businesspeople. They know their product is so good 
they're willing to give a little away for free upfront. They know you'll be back for more--
with money.

Emulate drug dealers. Make your product so good, so addictive, so "can't miss" 
that giving customers a small, free taste makes them come back with cash in hand.

This will force you to make something about your product bite-size. You want an 
easily digestible introduction to what you sell. This gives people a way to try it without 
investing any money or a lot of time.

Bakeries, restaurants, and ice cream shops have done this successfully for years. 
Car dealers let you test-drive cars before buying them. Software firms are also getting on 
board, with free trials or limited-use versions. How many other industries could benefit from the drug-dealer model? 

####  Marketing is not a department 

. Accounting is a department. Marketing isn't. 
Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365. 
 Just as you cannot not communicate, you cannot not market: 
 Every time you answer the phone, it's marketing. 
 Every time you send an e-mail, it's marketing. 
 Every time someone uses your product, it's marketing. 
 Every word you write on your Web site is marketing. 
 If you build software, every error message is marketing. 
 If you're in the restaurant business, the after-dinner mint is marketing. 
 If you're in the retail business, the checkout counter is marketing. 
 If you're in a service business, your invoice is marketing. 
 Recognize that all of these little things are more important than choosing which 
piece of swag to throw into a conference goodie bag. Marketing isn't just a few individual 
events. It's the sum total of everything you do.

####  The myth of the overnight sensation 

You will not be a big hit right away. You will not get rich quick. You are not so 
special that everyone else will instantly pay attention. No one cares about you. At least 
not yet. Get used to it.

You know those overnight-success stories you've heard about? It's not the whole 
story. Dig deeper and you'll usually find people who have busted their asses for years to 
get into a position where things could take off. And on the rare occasion that instant 
success does come along, it usually doesn't last--there's no foundation there to support it. 
 Trade the dream of overnight success for slow, measured growth. It's hard, but 
you have to be patient. You have to grind it out. You have to do it for a long time before 
the right people notice. 
 You may think you can speed up the process by hiring a PR firm. Don't bother. 
You're just not ready for that yet. For one thing, it's too expensive. Good PR firms can 
cost upward of $10,000 per month. That's a waste of money right now. 
 Plus, you're still just a no-name with a product no one's ever heard about. Who's 
going to write about that? Once you have some customers and a history, you'll have a story to tell. But just launching isn't a good story. 

## HIRING

####  Do it yourself first 

Never hire anyone to do a job until you've tried to do it yourself first. That way, 
you'll understand the nature of the work. You'll know what a job well done looks like. 
You'll know how to write a realistic job description and which questions to ask in an 
interview. You'll know whether to hire someone full-time or part-time, outsource it, or 
keep doing it yourself (the last is preferable, if possible).

You'll also be a much better manager, because you'll be supervising people who 
are doing a job you've done before. You'll know when to criticize and when to support.

At 37signals, we didn't hire a system administrator until one of us had spent a 
whole summer setting up a bunch of servers on his own. For the first three years, one of 
us did all of our customer support. Then we hired a dedicated support person. We ran with the ball as far as we could before handing it off. That way, we knew what we were 
looking for once we did decide to hire.

####  Hire when it hurts 

Don't hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain. Always ask yourself: What if we don't 
hire anyone? Is that extra work that's burdening us really necessary? Can we solve the 
problem with a slice of software or a change of practice instead? What if we just don't do 
it? 

Similarly, if you lose someone, don't replace him immediately. See how long you 
can get by without that person and that position. You'll often discover you don't need as 
many people as you think.

The right time to hire is when there's more work than you can handle for a 
sustained period of time. There should be things you can't do anymore. You should notice 
the quality level slipping. That's when you're hurting. And that's when it's time to hire, 
not earlier. 

####  Strangers at a cocktail party 

A small, intimate dinner party among old friends is a different story, though. 
There are genuinely interesting conversations and heated debates. At the end of the night, 
you feel you actually got something out of it. 

Hire a ton of people rapidly and a "strangers at a cocktail party" problem is 
exactly what you end up with. There are always new faces around, so everyone is 
unfailingly polite. Everyone tries to avoid any conflict or drama. No one says, "This idea 
sucks." People appease instead of challenge.

And that appeasement is what gets companies into trouble. You need to be able to 
tell people when they're full of crap. If that doesn't happen, you start churning out 
something that doesn't offend anyone but also doesn't make anyone fall in love. 

You need an environment where everyone feels safe enough to be honest when 
things get tough. You need to know how far you can push someone. You need to know 
what people really mean when they say something. 

####  Resumes are ridiculous 

We all know resumes are a joke. They're exaggerations. They're filled with 
"action verbs" that don't mean anything. They list job titles and responsibilities that are 
vaguely accurate at best. And there's no way to verify most of what's on there. The whole 
thing is a farce

Worst of all, they're too easy. Anyone can create a decent-enough resume. That's 
why half-assed applicants love them so much. They can shotgun out hundreds at a time to 
potential employers. It's another form of spam. They don't care about landing your job; 
they just care about landing any job. 

If someone sends out a resume to three hundred companies, that's a huge red flag 
right there. There's no way that applicant has researched you. There's no way he knows 
what's different about your company. 

If you hire based on this garbage, you're missing the point of what hiring is about. 
You want a specific candidate who cares specifically about your company, your products, 
your customers, and your job.

So how do you find these candidates? First step: Check the cover letter. In a cover 
letter, you get actual communication instead of a list of skills, verbs, and years of 
irrelevance. There's no way an applicant can churn out hundreds of personalized letters. 
That's why the cover letter is a much better test than a resume. You hear someone's actual 
voice and are able recognize if it's in tune with you and your company. 
 Trust your gut reaction. If the first paragraph sucks, the second has to work that 
much harder. If there's no hook in the first three, it's unlikely there's a match there. On the 
other hand, if your gut is telling you there's a chance at a real match, then move on to the 
interview stage

####  Years of irrelevance 

Of course, requiring some baseline level of experience can be a good idea when 
hiring. It makes sense to go after candidates with six months to a year of experience. It 
takes that long to internalize the idioms, learn how things work, understand the relevant 
tools, etc. 
 But after that, the curve flattens out. There's surprisingly little difference between 
a candidate with six months of experience and one with six years. The real difference 
comes from the individual's dedication, personality, and intelligence.

How long someone's been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well they've 
been doing it.

#### Forget about formal education

There are plenty of intelligent people who don't excel in the classroom. 
Don't fall into the trap of thinking you need someone from one of the "best" schools in 
order to get results. Ninety percent of CEOs currently heading the top five hundred 
American companies did not receive undergraduate degrees from Ivy League colleges. 

Too much time in academia can actually do you harm. Take writing, for example. 
When you get out of school, you have to unlearn so much of the way they teach you to 
write there. Some of the misguided lessons you learn in academia: 
 The longer a document is, the more it matters. 
 Stiff, formal tone is better than being conversational. 
 Using big words is impressive. 
 You need to write a certain number of words or pages to make a point. 
 The format matters as much (or more) than the content of what you write. 
 It's no wonder so much business writing winds up dry, wordy, and dripping with 
nonsense. People are just continuing the bad habits they picked up in school. It's not just 
academic writing, either. There are a lot of skills that are useful in academia that aren't 
worth much outside of it.

The pool of great candidates is far bigger than just people who 
completed college with a stellar GPA. Consider dropouts, people who had low GPAs, 
community-college students, and even those who just went to high school.

####  Hire managers of one 

Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. 
They don't need heavy direction. They don't need daily check-ins. They do what a 
manager would do--set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc.--but 
they do it by themselves and for themselves.

 These people free you from oversight. They set their own direction. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they've gotten done. They don't need 
a lot of hand-holding or supervision.

How can you spot these people? Look at their backgrounds. They have set the 
tone for how they've worked at other jobs. They've run something on their own or 
launched some kind of project. 

You want someone who's capable of building something from scratch and seeing 
it through. Finding these people frees the rest of your team to work more and manage 
less.

####  Test-drive employees 

Interviews are only worth so much. Some people sound like pros but don't work 
like pros. You need to evaluate the work they can do now, not the work they say they did 
in the past.

The best way to do that is to actually see them work. Hire them for a miniproject, 
even if it's for just twenty or forty hours. You'll see how they make decisions. You'll see 
if you get along. You'll see what kind of questions they ask. You'll get to judge them by 
their actions instead of just their words. 

th comes out. It's one thing to look at a portfolio, read a resume, or conduct an 
interview. It's another to actually work with someone.

## DAMAGE CONTROL 

####  Own your bad news 

When something goes wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You'll be better 
off if it's you. Otherwise, you create an opportunity for rumors, hearsay, and false 
information to spread.

When something bad happens, tell your customers (even if they never noticed in 
the first place). Don't think you can just sweep it under the rug. You can't hide anymore. 
These days, someone else will call you on it if you don't do it yourself. They'll post about 
it online and everyone will know. There are no more secrets.

Here are some tips on how you can own the story: 
 The message should come from the top. The highest-ranking person available 
should take control in a forceful way. 
 Spread the message far and wide. Use whatever megaphone you have. Don't try to 
sweep it under the rug. 
 "No comment" is not an option. 
 Apologize the way a real person would and explain what happened in detail. 
 Honestly be concerned about the fate of your customers--then prove it. 

####  Speed changes everything 

Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do 
when it comes to customer service. It's amazing how much that can defuse a bad situation 
and turn it into a good one. 
 Have you ever sent an e-mail and it took days or weeks for the company to get 
back to you? How did it make you feel? These days, that's what people have come to 
expect. They're used to being put on hold. They're used to platitudes about "caring" that 
aren't backed up.

That's why so many support queries start off with an antagonistic tone. Some 
people may even make threats or call you names. Don't take it personally. They think that's the only way to be heard. They're only trying to be a squeaky wheel in hopes it'll 
get them a little grease. 

Once you answer quickly, they shift 180 degrees. They light up. They become 
extra polite. Often they thank you profusely

It's especially true if you offer a personal response. Customers are so used to 
canned answers, you can really differentiate yourself by answering thoughtfully and 
showing that you're listening. And even if you don't have a perfect answer, say 
something. "Let me do some research and get back to you" can work wonders. 

####  How to say you're sorry 

There's never really a great way to say you're sorry, but there are plenty of terrible 
ways. One of the worst ways is the non-apology apology, which sounds like an apology but doesn't really accept any blame. For example, "We're sorry if this upset you." Or "I'm 
sorry that you don't feel we lived up to your expectations." Whatever.

A good apology accepts responsibility. It has no conditional if phrase attached. It 
shows people that the buck stops with you. And then it provides real details about what 
happened and what you're doing to prevent it from happening again. And it seeks a way 
to make things right.

_"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused."_

- "We apologize": You don't say "We apologize" to people if you spill their coffee. You say "I'm sorry". Use the appropriate tone and language to show that you understand the severity of what happened. "I" is stronger than "we".
- "Any inconvenience": It's not an inconvenience. It's a crisis.
- "This may have caused": "May" implies there might not be anything wrong at all, when obviously something is.

So what's the perfect way to say you're sorry? There's no magic bullet. Any stock 
answer will sound generic and hollow. You're going to have to take it on a case-by-case 
basis.

The number-one principle to keep in mind when you apologize: How would you 
feel about the apology if you were on the other end? If someone said those words to you, 
would you believe them? 

Keep in mind that you can't apologize your way out of being an ass. Even the best 
apology won't rescue you if you haven't earned people's trust. Everything you do before 
things go wrong matters far more than the actual words you use to apologize. If you've 
built rapport with customers, they'll cut you some slack and trust you when you say 
you're sorry. 

####  Put everyone on the front lines 

Cooking schools and smart restaurateurs know it's 
important for both sides to understand and empathize with each other. That's why they 
often have chefs work out front as waiters for a stretch. That way, the kitchen staff can 
interact with customers and see what it's actually like on the front lines.

A lot of companies have a similar front-of-house/back-of-house split. The people 
who make the product work in the "kitchen" while support handles the customers. 
Unfortunately, that means the product's chefs never get to directly hear what customers 
are saying. Too bad. Listening to customers is the best way to get in tune with a product's 
strengths and weaknesses.

The more people you have between your 
customers' words and the people doing the work, the more likely it is that the message 
will get lost or distorted along the way.

Everyone on your team should be connected to your customers--maybe not every 
day, but at least a few times throughout the year. That's the only way your team is going 
to feel the hurt your customers are experiencing. It's feeling the hurt that really motivates 
people to fix the problem. And the flip side is true too: The joy of happy customers or 
ones who have had a problem solved can also be wildly motivating. 

So don't protect the people doing the work from customer feedback. No one 
should be shielded from direct criticism.

Maybe you think you don't have time to interact with customers. Then make time. 
Craigslist founder Craig Newmark still answers support e-mails today (often within 
minutes). He also deletes racist comments from the site's discussion boards and pesters 
New York City Realtors who post apartments for rent that don't exist.* If he can devote 
this kind of attention to customer service, you can too. 

####  Take a deep breath 

When you rock the boat, there will be waves. After you introduce a new feature, 
change a policy, or remove something, knee-jerk reactions will pour in. Resist the urge to 
panic or make rapid changes in response. Passions flare in the beginning. That's normal. 
But if you ride out that first rocky week, things usually settle down.

Also, remember that negative reactions are almost always louder and more 
passionate than positive ones. In fact, you may hear only negative voices even when the 
majority of your customers are happy about a change. Make sure you don't foolishly 
backpedal on a necessary but controversial decision.

So when people complain, let things simmer for a while. Let them know you're 
listening. Show them you're aware of what they're saying. Let them know you understand 
their discontent. But explain that you're going to let it go for a while and see what 
happens. You'll probably find that people will adjust eventually.

## CULTURE

####  You don't create a culture 

Instant cultures are artificial cultures. They're big bangs made of mission 
statements, declarations, and rules. They are obvious, ugly, and plastic. Artificial culture 
is paint. Real culture is patina. 
 You don't create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don't have a 
culture. Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior. If you encourage people to share, 
then sharing will be built into your culture. If you reward trust, then trust will be built in. 
If you treat customers right, then treating customers right becomes your culture

Culture isn't a foosball table or trust falls. It isn't policy. It isn't the Christmas 
party or the company picnic. Those are objects and events, not culture. And it's not a 
slogan, either. Culture is action, not words.

So don't worry too much about it. Don't force it. You can't install a culture. Like a fine scotch, you've got to give it time to develop. 

####  Decisions are temporary 

"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?" 
 Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real 
problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.

Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot 
down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that 
whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end. It's just not so, especially for a 
small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are 
temporary

At this stage, it's silly to worry about whether or not your concept will scale from 
five to five thousand people (or from a hundred thousand to 100 million people). Getting 
a product or service off the ground is hard enough without inventing even more obstacles. 
Optimize for now and worry about the future later

The ability to change course is one of the big advantages of being small. 
Compared with larger competitors, you're way more capable of making quick, sweeping 
changes. Big companies just can't move that fast. So pay attention to today and worry 
about later when it gets here. Otherwise you'll waste energy, time, and money fixating on 
problems that may never materialize. 

####  Skip the rock stars 

Instead of thinking about how you can land a roomful of rock stars, think about 
the room instead. We're all capable of bad, average, and great work. The environment has 
a lot more to do with great work than most people realize. 
 That's not to say we're all created equal and you'll unlock star power in anyone 
with a rock star environment. But there's a ton of untapped potential trapped under lame 
policies, poor direction, and stifling bureaucracies. Cut the crap and you'll find that 
people are waiting to do great work. They just need to be given the chance. 
 This isn't about casual Fridays or bring-your-dog-to-work day. (If those are such 
good things, then why aren't you doing them every day of the week?) 
 Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility. They're 
a result of giving people the privacy, workspace, and tools they deserve. Great 
environments show respect for the people who do the work and how they do it. 

####  They're not thirteen 

When you treat people like children, you get children's work. Yet that's exactly 
how a lot of companies and managers treat their employees. Employees need to ask 
permission before they can do anything. They need to get approval for every tiny 
expenditure. It's surprising they don't have to get a hall pass to go take a shit.

When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of nonthinkers. 
You create a boss-versus-worker relationship that screams, "I don't trust you."

What do you gain if you ban employees from, say, visiting a social-networking 
site or watching YouTube while at work? You gain nothing. That time doesn't magically 
convert to work. They'll just find some other diversion.

And look, you're not going to get a full eight hours a day out of people anyway. 
That's a myth. They might be at the office for eight hours, but they're not actually 
working eight hours. People need diversions. It helps disrupt the monotony of the 
workday. A little YouTube or Facebook time never hurt anyone. 

Then there's all the money and time you spend policing this stuff. How much does 
it cost to set up surveillance software? How much time do IT employees waste on monitoring other employees instead of working on a project that's actually valuable? 

####  Send people home at 5 

The dream employee for a lot of companies is a twenty-something with as little of 
a life as possible outside of work--someone who'll be fine working fourteen-hour days 
and sleeping under his desk. 
 But packing a room full of these burn-the-midnight-oil types isn't as great as it 
seems. It lets you get away with lousy execution. It perpetuates myths like "This is the 
only way we can compete against the big guys." You don't need more hours; you need 
better hours.

When people have something to do at home, they get down to business. They get their work done at the office because they have somewhere else to be. They find ways to 
be more efficient because they have to. They need to pick up the kids or get to choir 
practice. So they use their time wisely

As the saying goes, "If you want something done, ask the busiest person you 
know." You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care 
about more than one thing. You shouldn't expect the job to be someone's entire life--at 
least not if you want to keep them around for a long time.

####  Don't scar on the first cut 

The second something goes wrong, the natural tendency is to create a policy. 
"Someone's wearing shorts!? We need a dress code!" No, you don't. You just need to tell 
John not to wear shorts again.

 Policies are organizational scar tissue. They are codified overreactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again. They are collective punishment for the 
misdeeds of an individual. 
 This is how bureaucracies are born. No one sets out to create a bureaucracy. They 
sneak up on companies slowly. They are created one policy--one scar--at a time. 
 So don't scar on the first cut. Don't create a policy because one person did 
something wrong once. Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over 
again. 

####  Sound like you 

What is it with businesspeople trying to sound big? The stiff language, the formal 
announcements, the artificial friendliness, the legalese, etc. You read this stuff and it 
sounds like a robot wrote it. These companies talk at you, not to you.

This mask of professionalism is a joke. We all know this. Yet small companies 
still try to emulate it. They think sounding big makes them appear bigger and more 
"professional." But it really just makes them sound ridiculous. Plus, you sacrifice one of a 
small company's greatest assets: the ability to communicate simply and directly, without 
running every last word through a legal-and PR-department sieve.

There's nothing wrong with sounding your own size. Being honest about who you 
are is smart business, too. Language is often your first impression--why start it off with a 
lie? Don't be afraid to be you. 

Talk to customers the way you would to 
friends. Explain things as if you were sitting next to them. Avoid jargon or any sort of 
corporate-speak. Stay away from buzzwords when normal words will do just fine. Don't 
talk about "monetization" or being "transparent;" talk about making money and being 
honest. Don't use seven words when four will do.

And don't force your employees to end e-mails with legalese like "This e-mail 
message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and 
privileged information." That's like ending all your company e-mails with a signature that 
says, "We don't trust you and we're ready to prove it in court." Good luck making friends 
that way.

Write to be read, don't write just to write. Whenever you write something, read it 
out loud. Does it sound the way it would if you were actually talking to someone? If not, 
how can you make it more conversational? 
 Who said writing needs to be formal? Who said you have to strip away your 
personality when putting words on paper? Forget rules. Communicate! 
 And when you're writing, don't think about all the people who may read your 
words. Think of one person. Then write for that one person. Writing for a mob leads to 
generalities and awkwardness. When you write to a specific target, you're a lot more 
likely to hit the mark. 

####  Four-letter words 

There are four-letter words you should never use in business. They're not fuck or 
shit. They're need, must, can't, easy, just, only, and fast. These words get in the way of 
healthy communication. They are red flags

When you use these four-letter words, you create a black-and-white situation. But 
the truth is rarely black and white. So people get upset and problems ensue. Tension and 
conflict are injected unnecessarily. 

Here's what's wrong with some of them:Need. Very few things actually need to 
get done. Instead of saying "need," you're better off saying "maybe" or "What do you 
think about this?" or "How does this sound?" or "Do you think we could get away with 
that?" Can't. When you say "can't," you probably can. Sometimes there are even opposing can'ts: "We can't launch it like that, because it's not quite right" versus "We 
can't spend any more time on this because we have to launch." Both of those statements 
can't be true. Or wait a minute, can they? Easy. Easy is a word that's used to describe 
other people's jobs. "That should be easy for you to do, right?" But notice how rarely 
people describe their own tasks as easy. For you, it's "Let me look into it"--but for others, 
it's "Get it done." 

These four-letter words often pop up during debates (and also watch out for their 
cousins: everyone, no one, always, and never). Once uttered, they make it tough to find a 
solution. They box you into a corner by pitting two absolutes against each other. That's 
when head-butting occurs. You squeeze out any middle ground.

And these words are especially dangerous when you string them together: "We 
need to add this feature now. We can't launch without this feature. Everyone wants it. It's 
only one little thing so it will be easy. You should be able to get it in there fast!" Only 
thirty-six words, but a hundred assumptions. That's a recipe for disaster.

## CONCLUSION 

####  Inspiration is perishable 

We all have ideas. Ideas are immortal. They last forever. 
 What doesn't last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It 
has an expiration date. 
 If you want to do something, you've got to do it now. You can't put it on a shelf 
and wait two months to get around to it. You can't just say you'll do it later. Later, you 
won't be pumped up about it anymore. 
 If you're inspired on a Friday, swear off the weekend and dive into the project. 
When you're high on inspiration, you can get two weeks of work done in twenty-four 
hours. Inspiration is a time machine in that way. 
 Inspiration is a magical thing, a productivity multiplier, a motivator. But it won't 
wait for you. Inspiration is a now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to 
work.
