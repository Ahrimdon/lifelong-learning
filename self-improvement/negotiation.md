## What should everyone know about negotiation?
[Reference](https://www.quora.com/What-should-everyone-know-about-negotiation)

- Game theory. Negotiators tap the three: actions, information, and pay-offs to get both parties to come to the Nash equilibrium.
- Negotiating a car: price, situation, time.
  - I know I have to buy a car, the dealer wants to maximize the units sold per quarter. If you go buy a car at the end of the quarter, you are more likely to reduce the price.
  - The one with time advantage can ask the other one to bend the prices.
  - Going to hotels, tell them I am checking out prices offered by other hotels, and when I find the best deal, I will settle. I don't bring the luggage so it doesn't look like I have a hard time moving across hotels.
- In any disagreement, individuals understandably aim to achieve the best possible outcome for their position (or perhaps an organisation they represent). However, the principles of fairness, seeking mutual benefit and maintaining a relationship are the keys to a successful outcome.

- Limit options to 2-3, paradox of choice. Find the perfect solution.
- Falling for the bluff. People who bluff generally overcompensate.
- State what you want and focus on your intended goal and not on your ego.
- Dwelling on sunk costs & time spent: focus on deals that make sense, because time is your most valuable asset.

- Empathetic: What does the other party want to happen, and how much? If I can get them into a truthful place, it's easy for everyone to win.
- Honesty--be transparent about your actual goal.
- Show business based on providing lifetime value. Negotiation is all about speed, movement, trust, and building relationships.

## 5 Things Most People Don't Know About Negotiating
[Reference](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-things-most-people-dont-know-about-negotiating)

- *The Negotiation Doesn't Start Until Someone Says "No".* It's not really a negotiation if we're asking for something we know our bargaining partner also wants. Negotiation is a conversation whose goal is to reach an agreement with someone whose interests are perfectly aligned with yours. Anchor first and anchor high, and you'll be paying in the big leagues.
- *It's Never About Money.* Treat money not as an objective measure of worth, but as a subjective experience.
- *Your Bargaining Strength is All in Your Head.* Some home sellers are pressured by time, even in a seller's market. The more knowledge you have of the hidden interests, the more negotiation power you have.
- *Any Reason is Far Better Than No Reason and Nearly as Good as an Excellent One.* You don't have to prove something that justifies what you want, all you have to do is say it. Appearances are reality. Take credit for last quarter's increase in net profits even if you can't prove it.

- *Share information.* People tend to be matchers and "follow the norm of reciprocity, responding in kind to how we treat them." If we want to be trusted, we must first offer it. Simply putting yourself out there--hobbies, personal concerns, hopes--can set a positive tone that's conducive to gaining agreement.
- *Rank order your priorities.* Leave all issues on the table and be transparent about it.
- *Go in knowing your target price and your walkaway terms.*
- *Make the first offer.* Anchoring.
- *Don't counter too low.*
- *Counter-offers make both parties feel more satisfied.* Since they did the counter-offer, they will be more satisfied.

# What is the best way to become a better negotiator?
[Reference](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-become-a-better-negotiator/answers/2584263)

- Understand their motivation.
- Understand your expectations. What would you consider a win and what would you consider a bottom line?
- Develop your strategy: subject, timeframe to complete, and the price.
  - Whoever throws out the first price is usually the one who anchors the price-point on the deal. When you have the advantage, get them to throw the price out first. Do not accept it, even if it is double what you were expecting.
  - Timeframe: If they are hurrying up, you can anchor the price of NEW + opportunity cost.
  - Price: When you have the disadvantage, throw out a price you are comfortable with, and do not accept anything less than your bottom line.

# What should people know about negotiating a deal, position, sale, or any other situation? What are some of the most common mistakes?
[Reference](https://www.quora.com/What-should-people-know-about-negotiating-a-deal-position-sale-or-any-other-situation-What-are-some-of-the-most-common-mistakes)

- The minute you pass the point when you’re willing to say, “I’m prepared to walk away from this,” you lose in the negotiations.
- There’s always another house, another job, another car. You can make more friends, you can find another girlfriend. You can watch another film, read another book, go on a different holiday.
- Leverage is a force. Some cultures spend a lot of time and money wining and dining business partners. These emotional ties work as leverage. Microsoft has huge leverage over the OEMs that produced PCs. They used their leverage to become a monopoly. Leverage can also be faked. Maybe they don't actually have what they say they have.
- Politics is also a force. Make a conscious effort to understand and see where the decisions are being made, who has the power, and what motives are in play. *Unless you are negotiating with the boss, you are almost always negotiating with the negotiator who's job it is to do their due diligence, find the best deal, and prove to their superiors that they are doing a great job. If you can make this person's job easier and get them a promotion at the same time, you will be hard to turn down.*
- Don't react, go out to the balcony. Reframe the dispute in terms of interests, rather than positions.
- Make it easy for them to say "yes" by removing common obstacles to agreement. Opponents resist ideas that are not their own. Avoid the temptation to tell the other side what the solution is.

# Getting Past No: Negotiating With Difficult People
[Reference](https://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/example/pastno.htm)

- Recognize the tactics your opponent is using, then recognize your own feelings and "hot button" issues.
- Distance yourself emotionally and view the situation objectively. Figure out the "best alternative to a negotiated settlement."
- Disarm the opponent by stepping to their side. The goal is to reassure them and help them regain their own mental balance.
  - Listen actively, ask clarifying questions, acknowledge their points and feelings, apologize if appropriate, focus on areas of agreement, use the word "yes" to reduce tensions.
- Reframe the dispute in terms of interests, rather than positions. Ask open-ended, problem solving-oriented questions. Ask "why" questions to elicit the opponent's interests. Ask them "what if" questions.
- Build them a golden bridge. Make it easy for them to say yes by removing the common obstacles to agreement. Opponents may resists ideas that are not their own, instead, ask for their ideas and criticisms.
  - Offer them choices. Their resistance may indicate that they have unmet interests. Try to understand the other side's logic and perspective, and do not overlook intangible interests such as needs for recognition, identity, or security.
  - Third-party recommendations: a proposal that is unacceptable coming from you may be acceptable if it comes from a third-party. Suggest ways of presenting the agreement to constituents in the most favorable light.
- Make it hard for the opponent to say no. "Instead of using power to bring your opponent to his knees, use it to bring him to his senses." The goal is to educate the other party to realize that an agreement is in their best interest.
- Ask them reality-testing questions about what will happen if no agreement is reached. The more power you use, the more you need to defuse your opponents resistance.
