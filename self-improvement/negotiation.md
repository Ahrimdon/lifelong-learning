## What should everyone know about negotiation?
[Reference](https://www.quora.com/What-should-everyone-know-about-negotiation)

- Game theory. Negotiators tap the three: actions, information, and pay-offs to get both parties to come to the Nash equilibrium.
- Negotiating a car: price, situation, time.
  - I know I have to buy a car, the dealer wants to maximize the units sold per quarter. If you go buy a car at the end of the quarter, you are more likely to reduce the price.
  - The one with time advantage can ask the other one to bend the prices.
  - Going to hotels, tell them I am checking out prices offered by other hotels, and when I find the best deal, I will settle. I don't bring the luggage so it doesn't look like I have a hard time moving across hotels.
- In any disagreement, individuals understandably aim to achieve the best possible outcome for their position (or perhaps an organisation they represent). However, the principles of fairness, seeking mutual benefit and maintaining a relationship are the keys to a successful outcome.

- Limit options to 2-3, paradox of choice. Find the perfect solution.
- Falling for the bluff. People who bluff generally overcompensate.
- State what you want and focus on your intended goal and not on your ego.
- Dwelling on sunk costs & time spent: focus on deals that make sense, because time is your most valuable asset.

- Empathetic: What does the other party want to happen, and how much? If I can get them into a truthful place, it's easy for everyone to win.
- Honesty--be transparent about your actual goal.
- Show business based on providing lifetime value. Negotiation is all about speed, movement, trust, and building relationships.

## 5 Things Most People Don't Know About Negotiating
[Reference](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-things-most-people-dont-know-about-negotiating)

- *The Negotiation Doesn't Start Until Someone Says "No".* It's not really a negotiation if we're asking for something we know our bargaining partner also wants. Negotiation is a conversation whose goal is to reach an agreement with someone whose interests are perfectly aligned with yours. Anchor first and anchor high, and you'll be paying in the big leagues.
- *It's Never About Money.* Treat money not as an objective measure of worth, but as a subjective experience.
- *Your Bargaining Strength is All in Your Head.* Some home sellers are pressured by time, even in a seller's market. The more knowledge you have of the hidden interests, the more negotiation power you have.
- *Any Reason is Far Better Than No Reason and Nearly as Good as an Excellent One.* You don't have to prove something that justifies what you want, all you have to do is say it. Appearances are reality. Take credit for last quarter's increase in net profits even if you can't prove it.

- *Share information.* People tend to be matchers and "follow the norm of reciprocity, responding in kind to how we treat them." If we want to be trusted, we must first offer it. Simply putting yourself out there--hobbies, personal concerns, hopes--can set a positive tone that's conducive to gaining agreement.
- *Rank order your priorities.* Leave all issues on the table and be transparent about it.
- *Go in knowing your target price and your walkaway terms.*
- *Make the first offer.* Anchoring.
- *Don't counter too low.*
- *Counter-offers make both parties feel more satisfied.* Since they did the counter-offer, they will be more satisfied.
