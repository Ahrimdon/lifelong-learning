- **Organizing your life.** Most people spend their life doing shallow things. Very few people have organized their lives to prioritize almost exclusively important and deep activity. **No one cares about your success more than you do.**
  - Environment energy: Is your living space cluttered? Do you keep stuff you no longer use? Is your car clean or just another place to keep your crap? Does your environment facilitate the emotions you consistently want to experience? Does your environment drain or improve your energy?
  - Financial energy: Debt, do you know how much you spend per month and how many dollars you make per month? What's holding you back from creating more value in other people's lives?
  - Relational energy: Are your relationships the most meaningful and enjoyable part of your life? Do you spend enough time nurturing the relationships that really matter? Do you maintain toxic relationships that no longer serve you? Are you authentic and honest in your relationships?
  - Health energy: Are you conscious of and in control of the foods you put in your body? Does the food you eat improve or worsen the other areas of your life? Does your body reflect your highest ideals? Is your body as strong and fit as you want it to be?
  - Spiritual energy: Do you have a sense of purpose in life? Have you come to terms with life and death in a way you resonate with? When you organize your spiritual life, you become clear on what your life is about.
  - Time: Is your time being wasted on things you don't intrinsically enjoy? Are the activities you spend your time doing moving you toward your ideal future? What activities could you outsource or automate that take up your time?
- **Plan and Invest In Your Future.**
  - Instead of having a pre-set plan of what he wants to do, Tim Ferriss executes on 3-6 month experiments that he's currently excited about.
  - If you plan with new people, the whole becomes different and better than the sum of its parts.
- **Tracking important metrics.**
  - When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.
  - Key relationships, business/finances, and self-improvement (health or how you use your time).
- **Prayer and meditation.**
  - While praying and/or meditation for a large portion of time, the level of your thoughts will elevate. And interesting things will begin happening. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of miracles, think of it as luck.
0 **Move toward your goals every single day.**
  - **How many days go by where you did nothing to move toward your big goals?**
  - "You'll pile up enough tomorrows, and you'll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays."
