## Chapter 1 -- Buy One, Get Two Free

The teams that made the most money didn't use the five dollars at all. They realized that focusing on the money actually framed the problem too tightly.

What can we do to make money if we start with absolutely nothing?

One group waited in line at the different restaurants. They sold the reservations for up to $20/customer. Female students sold better, so male students ran around town.

Other group put air in tires. More money came in when via donation rather than offering to do the service for $1.

Highest money earned by the students who thought the most important component was their time. So they sold it to a company for three minutes exposure to Stanford students.

Think of the paperclip for a house guy, value increases slowly.

#### Lessons Learned

Opportunities are abundant. At any place and time you can look around and identify problems that need solving. The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.

Regardless of the size of the problem, there are usually creative ways to use the resources you have to solve them.

We frame problems too tightly.

For most people, the world is quite different than a typical classroom. There isn't one right answer that leads to a clear reward. It is helpful to know that we don't have to be right the first time.

## Chapter 2 -- The Upside-Down Circus

We aren't taught to embrace problems. We're taught that problems are to be avoided, or something to complain about.

We can choose to view the world through different lenses -- the more we take on problems, the more confident and proficient we become at solving them.

## Chapter 3 -- Bikini or Die

B.F. Skinner: All human behavior can be viewed as being adapted to either the individual, the gene pool, or to society at large.

But when is a rule really just a suggestion, and when do suggestions morph into rules?

We make a lot of rules for ourselves, in large part encouraged by others. We draw imaginary lines around what we think we can do--lines that often limit us much more than the rules imposed by society at large. We define ourselves by our professions, our income, where we live, the car we drive, our education.

Larry Page: "Think as big as possible." It is often easier to have big goals than to have small goals.
