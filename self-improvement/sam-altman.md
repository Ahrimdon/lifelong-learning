# How To Be Successful
[Reference](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

- **Compound yourself.** Don't be in a career where people who have been doing it for 2 years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for 20: your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work should generate more and more results. Long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together.
- **Have almost too much self-belief.** As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more. If you don't believe in yourself, it's hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future, but this is where most value gets created. Self-awareness: truth-seeking is hard and painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.
- **Learn to think independently.**
- **Get good at "sales".** Convince other people of what you believe. All great careers become sales jobs. You need vision, communication skills, charisma, evidence that you can execute. Make sure your communication is clear and use plain, concise language.
- **Make it easy to take risks.**
- **Focus.**
- **Work hard.**
- **Be bold.** People want to be a part of something exciting and feel that their work matters. Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you often seem exciting to other people too.
- **Be willful.** You can bend the world to your will a surprising % of the time, but most people just accept that things are the way they are. Ask for what you want. You usually won't get it, and often the rejection will be painful, but when this works, it works surprisingly well. "I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are, I'm going to figure them out".
- **Be hard to compete with.** Leverage: brand, personal relationships, being good.
- **Build a network.** Help people as much as you can. Remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.
- **You get rich by owning things.** Owning a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property.
- **Be internally driven.** Successful people do what they do to impress themselves because they are compelled to make something happen in the world.
