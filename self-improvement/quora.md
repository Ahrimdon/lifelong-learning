Here are some of the things I've learned that relate especially to business and management:

**There's no substitute for taking a lot of actions.** Every good pro StarCraft player has really high APM. Even players who are famous for being pro despite having low APM are ways faster than most people. Sure, you need to be smart about which things you choose to do and precise with your actions. **No matter how smart you are, your effectiveness is going to be limited if you aren't talking to lots of people, sending lots of e-mails, and just doing lots of stuff every day. Don't underestimate how much value there is in doing whatever you are doing faster so you can move on to doing more things.**

**Macro is usually more important than micro but at critical moments, micromanagement can mean the difference between massive success and disastrous failure.** For example, if you are making a movie, building a great team of actors and other people to work on the movie and getting enough funding, etc. is generally going to drive the success of the film, but if there's just something off about the story, then the movie can fail so that's something that might need good micro.

**There is usually more than one way to accomplish something.** Context means a lot. The map and situation will make different choices better and worse but it doesn't necessarily mean anything definitive about any particular choice in the abstract. **In life, there are usually multiple paths to the same place.** If you want to be a Super Bowl winning quarterback, you can either go to a big name program (like Tom Brady at Michigan), maybe not get much playing time but be surrounded by top notch coaches and teammates and competition so you're well prepared for the NFL, or you can go to a smaller school (like Ben Roethlisberger at Miami of Ohio) and be "the man" for 4 years, get to throw a ton of passes, and generally get a ton of good practice and attention. In most things, there are a lot of wrong ways to approach a problem but still usually more than one way that will work.

**Timing is critical.** Loopt had a lot of the same ideas as foursquare, but started before location services were ubiquitous. In StarCraft, timing a push exactly to maximize your advantage is one of the most important principles of the game. Relatedly, you can never get back wasted time. If you forget to build a probe for 15 seconds, you'll never be able to catch up to someone who is executing the same build perfectly.

**Execution is first order more important than strategy but there's also a ceiling on how well something can be executed, and then strategy matters. When competitors are all executing at a similar level, strategy can make a huge difference.** For example, Microsoft and Apple were both executing pretty well in the personal computer business in the 1980s and early 1990s, but Microsoft's strategy turned out to be better for the market at that time. Apple is now executing well on iPad and iPhone and laptops with a strategy that looks a lot like its strategy for the Macintosh in the 1980s and 1990s (fully integrated experience that includes hardware and software, lots of focus on design, higher prices, less customizable but better default experience) but for the time and market that they are in now, the strategy is actually really good, and so it's important.

**In cases where competitors aren't executing equally well, strategy doesn't really matter much.** In the case of Myspace vs. Facebook, it probably made more sense actually to start by letting anyone sign up and not restricting the site to college students, but since Facebook executed much better, it was able to close the gap in users and pass Myspace pretty easily.

**Long term success is usually achieved by getting a small advantage and then using that to get some other kind of advantage.** In StarCraft, this can mean something like getting map control with a mobile army then using that to expand safely, which gets you an economic advantage, which then lets you get a huge doom army which will let you win the game. In life, this might mean something like being born into a famous Hollywood family which makes it easy for you to become an actor which makes it possible for you to star in a bunch of movies which lets you get a starring role in TV show like Two and a Half Men which leads to #winning. **Artosis' way of talking about this principle in StarCraft is by saying "When you're ahead, get more ahead" (as opposed to just trying to go kill your opponent).**

**Talent is a prerequisite for being top notch at most things, but in almost any field, no one gets really good at anything without putting in more focused effort and time than other people.** This is mostly intuition but I think people underestimate how hard people like LeBron James and Cory Booker and even someone who runs the shift at an airport checkpoint, for example, work to get to the top of their game. If you read interviews with top StarCraft players like IdrA, the way they got there was mostly thinking a lot about how to improve and putting in a bunch of hours of practice.

**Different people (/units) are good at different things.** It's important to have the right people and put them in a position to succeed. When beginners play StarCraft, they often ask "What is the best unit to get?" and there isn't really an answer. In life, it's easy to fall into the trap of idolizing individuals that are great at something important and assume they'll be the best at everything else too. Maybe the biggest life lesson one can learn from this is to put yourself in a position that plays to your strengths.

Relatedly, groups can perform better if they are made up of complementary kinds of people. In StarCraft, for example, zealots plus marines are much stronger than just zealots or just marines. In life, this is true too.

**If you are better than your competition, you want the game to go on longer.** The more decisions there are, the greater the chances that the better player will win. In StarCraft, this is why many very strong players like IdrA prefer to play macro games rather than short rush games or cheeses.

It's not one big thing but a bunch of little things that add up. Most games in StarCraft aren't like the InCa vs. Rain game I linked to above -- they end up being won because one player is able to squeeze out a few more workers and a few more units and get a slightly bigger army that then lets him/her roll over the opponent. In all the rest of these lessons, it's pretty easy to pick out some story or situation that illustrates the point but it's a little bit tricky because little things like losing a scouting probe or forgetting a chronoboost don't matter that much, but if you play enough games, you realize that all these things add up and sometimes they are really important. Life is kind of the same way. **For example, if you treat people well your whole life, you'll find yourself with a whole bunch of friends later on in life and it will be a lot easier for you to be successful, whereas if you rip people off or are just unkind, it won't matter much in the short term but years later, its likely to add up to being lonely and without allies.** I think this is my favorite lesson from StarCraft. It's pretty inspiring to be reminded that showing up every day and trying to do the right thing and working hard will probably matter in the long run.

##[How can I accelerate my personal growth?](http://www.quora.com/Self-Improvement/How-can-I-accelerate-my-personal-growth)

- In other words, choose "anxiety-driven growth" over "boredom-driven growth". Whenever you can, as long as the water's not too far over your head, just jump in, and figure it out as you go.
- Most people grow an average of 10% per year. But this is way too slow if you want to accomplish great things. Aim for at least 25% per year.
- Be surrounded by people who are smarter than you. They will most likely be your colleagues for the next 30 years.
- Have an opportunity to fail. You want to have about 30-60% chance to fail. To improve, you have to be put in positions where success is not guaranteed.
- The company has a history of giving massive responsibility to people that look like you. High growth, so you can have high responsibility and gain skills more quickly.
- "What step can I take right at this moment, no matter how small, to get closer to my goal?"
- "What is the most important thing I did today?" "What is the most important thing I'll do tomorrow?"
- Environment is super important: Make sure you are surrounded by people who are driven, optimistic, supportive.
- Work in locations where you have greater control on your environment.
- Reduce context switching. Focus on one task only.
- Work with and under highly skilled people.
- Maintain good health via exercise.
- Have fun and avoid burnouts.
- **Take risks that your peers do not, you MUST do this because the road less traveled is by definition the only road that will allow you to get ahead because getting ahead means doing things differently. Go for big successes or big failures. Anything in between doesn't stand out. The worst thing you can be in your career is invisible.**
- Second, you'll notice that the people who accomplish a lot ALWAYS surrounded themselves with exceptional people smarter than themselves. From Steve Jobs to Gandhi, they were able to recognize, attract, and retain great people.
- Lastly, the type of product, company, and industry you are working in will heavily influence your future opportunities. Tech is a great place to be no matter what your skill set is.
- "If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. Just get on."
- Be very mindful of who your friends and associates are. What you consume heavily influences who you are and what you become. Personal growth is experiences-driven.
- Define what personal growth means to you. And ask yourself why it's so important to you.
- Surround yourself with people you'd like to emulate: people who have accomplished the goals you want to achieve. Whether it's volunteering your time at a local business to gain valuable people in your network OR attending events that pertain to your field OR even joining a club. This is extremely important.
