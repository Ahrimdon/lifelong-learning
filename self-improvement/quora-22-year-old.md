## How should a 22-year-old invest time?

### Neal Wu, searching for truth 

* *Make friends as opposed to networking.* Your friends will go a lot further than the professional contacts you make, especially since only one of the two groups is invested in your personal happiness.
* *Become an expert by learning as much as you can and deeply seeking out the things you are curious about.* Find the things you enjoy and practice the skills you want to develop. If you can achieve expertise then it will be easy to obtain an audience.
* *Volunteer to help out those less fortunate than you.* In the process you will gain a ton of new perspective and will better understand other people's real problems. In a society that always looks upward, they can be easy to forget.
* *Become as independent as possible.* Even if you work at a big company, constantly make small steps to gain skills and reduce your dependence on your job. Write a book, build an app, or start a small business on the side. Release your inner entrepreneur.
* *Don't spend too much time worrying about your personal brand.* Accomplish things, and the recognition will follow.
* *Stop treating life as a competition and do things for their own sake.* Genuine interest should be what drives you to improve yourself, rather than simply a desire to beat others. Find a community of people who are interested in the same things as you, and drive each other to be the best you can be.

Between 16 and about 30, life gives us incredible energy.  After that, we have less energy and less time.  As Franklin said, "Do ye love life?  Then do not waste time, for that is the stuff life is made of."  You see, one of the great lessons of Western Civ is to delay gratification in hopes of a better reward down the road. Hence, the many compelling time-wasters of our day (mindless internet surfing, video games, texting, reality TV, endless social media use, porn, bad relationships etc.,) --these are all a slow drip of poison for the life you hope to have. *You can never get back those many hours wasted.*

Read, study and build skills. Listen to old people.  Hone your ability to concentrate. You are now in the 'habit-forming' time of your life, that will carry forward for many years. Guard your integrity: your word, the quality of your friendships, the interests you allow yourself. Be fully in the moment; life is more interesting that way.

Think about your young life this way, as an opportunity to pack away experiences.  It's hard to find the time to learn them, later.

For those NOT on scholarship and WITHOUT deep parental financial support:  A young person should first seriously consider learning a trade, at a tech or occupational school, before their college career.  A trade: working with your hands with a bona fide skill connects you to the real world in a way classroom knowledge cannot.  Your work at that trade will pay you much more per hour.

Use the trade as a tool to better yourself, as part of a broader goal, with timelines, a series of objectives and discipline. 

Don't be afraid to realize that some of your friends may be time-vampires, or for that matter, emotion-, or energy-vampires. All relationships are a give-and-take, but if your friends chronically derail you from your goals, dreams or better judgment, get new friends. 

Brain-building - If you can't concentrate and read a book for a few hours, work on it anyway.  Until at least the age of 25, the brain is still developing its habits.  Starve its craving for the video games you play, and feed its ability to focus on books or a study topic.  This gets much easier with practice.  

*Your choices in life don't just define you, they become you.* You are your choices:  That simple fact is the greatest piece of wisdom anyone ever gave me.  You see, our brains grow to meet the experiences we give ourselves.  If you spent hundreds or thousands of hours on video games, your brain will be wired to seek pleasure through them, and it will be a serious battle of withdrawal to break away from that endorphin source.  The same is true with all habits we nurture.  When YOU control your brain's input, instead of passively seeking whatever is pleasurable, you can begin to change your habits and your very self.  Example: More study make studying easier. Or, regular writing helps you communicate better over time. Talking, versus texting, helps you develop interpersonal skills that will make you more valuable as an employee and a better friend. You'll create new clusters of brain synapses to support an ability or skill where they didn't exist before.  But the reverse it true, too, for bad habits...

So ask yourself, *"Do I really want to commit thousands of hours toward being an expert at video games, or at writing Reddit memes, or at an internet porn obsession?"  Ugh. At the end of your life, will you wish you had spent more time doing those things?  Do they offer any redeeming, long-term value to you? Of course not.* Some day, young one, you will understand what I am writing here. I'd rather you understand it now, than as a broken 70-year old, alone and muttering about the unfairness of life, and all your missed chances.

Be Fully in the Moment - Do you find yourself texting in class, or at a dinner with friends?  When you do that, those around you often feel uncomfortable, as if you are saying they are less important. Put it away, and open up your awareness to all you are missing. There are people you may see today whom you will never see again, old folks who will die, and younger people who may move away. Let them have a great last memory of you. 

Mentors: You may have a mom or dad who can give you practical advice.  Or a grandparent.  Seek them out, or an older person who is 'disinterested,' meaning they don't just think the world revolves around you. Give your mentors the freedom to tell you the truth, even to hurt your feelings.  Listen to how they perceive you, and your talents and weaknesses.  Eventually, you will use your talents to address and fix your weaknesses, but not if you're stuck blaming others for them.  Even if it was your parent's damn fault. 

Especially for young men, a "coming of age" experience is crucial to our psychological development.  I hitchhiked across Canada. Leaving the safety net and going it on one's own is an important step for how a boy becomes a man because it gives us a foundation for our own self-reliance. You will remember it when you need a boost of courage. 

Have you hurt someone recently?  Yes you have.  Face it.  Find a way to make amends, and explore and exhibit genuineness, kindness and empathy.  Let the other person's emotions wash over you, and get a sense of their perspective. Breathe it in, and let yourself feel bad.  It's human. Self-focused narcissism that would discount the feelings and needs of others is an utter epidemic right now; a little reasonable guilt, then forgiveness, is a healthy thing. And learn to be courteous to everyone.  You would be astounded to realize just how many people you pass every day who are suffering.

Finally, a habit of clear-eyed self-talk is incredibly valuable, and incredibly hard. If you can learn to put your B.S. excuses aside, and make agreements with yourself that you live up to, you will set yourself up for a far better life than giving in to every temptation that comes your way. When you realize that YOU own your life, and it is yours to create or destroy, that is the beginning of adulthood.

#### Heidi McDonald, If it's creative, I probably do it.

Travel, while you are young and unattached and can get by on student rates or stay at hostels.

Get involved in causes that matter to you. You will never have this much energy, health this great, or this much disposable time, again in your life. Make the most of it. This is your best chance to make a difference in the world.

Make a habit of following current events (and I don't mean, the latest reality shows). Chances are, you'll find your passion, whether that's a cause you're interested in, or a niche you believe you can fill.

Expose yourself to many kinds of art. If all you expose yourself to is what's popular in the now, then later in life, you may become pigeonholed in this decade (which I promise might suck for you later in life). Adding variety will make you more interesting and give you cool things to talk about with others, since you're in prime socialization time and want to draw interesting people to you.

Surround yourself well. This is an age where many folks are falling into a rut; either they can't find a job, or they are having a hard time leaving their college days (and their college ways) behind. If you surround yourself with a bunch of stoner drunks who have no ambition, that is likely to rub off on you. Surround yourself with motivated, interesting people, and that is likely to rub off on you as well.

Create. Learn how to make something. Whether it's knitting, or sewing, or cooking, or some sort of creative or performing art, or technology, or building or restoring something...create. It's not just practical, it can also decrease your stress and increase your overall happiness.

Maintain family connections. This is the period in my life when I should have made a better effort at maintaining relationships with grandparents, aunts and uncles...people who at that age felt like they'd be around forever. THEY WON'T BE.

#### Andreas Blixt, developer at Spotify

Is there someone you really enjoy spending time with? Spend more time with them. No? There's a lot of amazing people out there. Don't worry so much about how you meet them, just put yourself out there. Don't like going to bars? Well, there's dancing lessons. Amateur photography groups. Painting lessons. Yoga. Martial arts. The Internet is also a great place for finding likeminded people.

It's not about how you spend your time, it's about how much time you feel you've had.

I can tell you, I've had weeks where I did some really good work, but I can't remember when they were or exactly what I did. Looking back, it kind of feels like those weeks went by in a second. On the other hand, I do remember going on that one hike one autumn day, and I have plenty of memories from it – so many that it feels like it must've lasted more than a day.

I like to collect those memories, because that's all I'll have when it's time for me to depart. That's what I really think any person of any age should do. Go create those memories!

#### Francis Chen, cultural bridge and translator 

Work on your communication and your writing skills. Be actively learning and comfortable articulating your interests, opinions, advice, passions, expertise, etc., regardless of how confident you feel.

You may not know what you want to do in life; you probably have a lot of different interests. In any work situation, any relationship building, the key to connecting to people is communication. You may know everything in the world, but if you can't communicate it properly, you will have so many missed opportunities!

#### Ajim Bagwan, Life is what you make of it, not what happens to you.

Learn the art of life. Realize that the best things in life aren't things. That the happiness and peace of mind comes from within, depends solely on what you think. Learn to think.  Don't go by society's standards & the defined rights & wrongs. Think & find it out for yourself. Don't care what people would think. It's your life. Do what you love and do it often. Learn to live in the moment. Don't think about the past if it wasn't good, don't think about the future for it has yet to come. Always live in the present moment. Realize that we are on an organic spaceship that is revolving at a great speed in an universe which has no known start or end. Why worry about anything? Learn to be happy. And to find peace in your heart. Once you learn that, you will realize that everything else is just secondary. And that you can take whatever life throws at you. 

First do some uncommon things which many don't do and then decide what you wanna do with your life. Take the road less traveled. Read good books, watch good movies, listen to some good music. Be artistic. Create something. Have passion for something, For Life. 

Travel - no matter what the age, whether fit or unfit, if you can, always make time for travel. Go to new places, meet new people, learn about their life & culture. Every now & then, Spend a day (or week or month or year) or two in the wild, in the serenity of nature, away from all your daily life hassle.

Think. World is trying to keep you stupid. Starting from managing bank accounts, live TV shows, miracle diets - it's easier to control the people who don't think. How To Recognize an Idiot

Self-education. Don't blindly believe in educational system. While they are doing all the paperwork, the system gets old, sometimes breaks. Learn to be a leader  in anything you do, not the follower. This way you succeed in self-education and above. 

With time you will become more conservative. That's a given. Together with some people around you will create 'a bubble' to support status quo. That's why, time for crazy ideas and taking risks is NOW. Then you will become much more careful. 

Learn to cook. This will make your life much simpler and turn cooking from an expensive extravagance into a pleasant endeavor. Check out Jamie Oliver's blog or find any other resources.

#### Claudia Eslahpazir

Travel in order to learn, not to see or be a tourist.  You will discover ways of life, ways of thinking and ways of being that will reshape your entire perception of what "should be."

Do things that make you feel uncomfortable.  It's scary when you begin, but always wonderful when you finish.  Fear holds us back from a lot.

Tell your friends and family that you love them and care about them - a lot.  We don't do this enough.  It's great to start that habit when you're young.  You'll find it will pay itself back ten-fold each time.

Don't get caught up in the race for success.  You'll learn over time that "Accomplishment" does not equate to happiness.  Really sit back and listen to what it is that makes you happy.  There are many rich and successful people out there that are miserable and many poor ones that are overflowing with joy.  Both can teach us valuable lessons.

Date a lot and meet a lot of people.  Long term relationships at your age are difficult because it's a time when you're meant to be changing and learning so rapidly.  You are most likely to find that you and a long-term partner will grow apart over time as you develop yourselves.  Be open to opportunities.

Don't worry about figuring out who you are.  You will never find the answer to this.  Just think about "who am I right at this moment" and appreciate it.  But understand that will change and that's ok - it's awesome.

#### Tanmoy Roy, Live more, each day. 

Before you enter the "usual work-family cycle", I would recommend you to experience unconventional areas of work/life (and hopefully find something you'd truly love to do). At 23 you probably have no dependents and will be the only time in your life where you can experiment with minimal risk. 

Read as much as you can. Watch a lot of documentaries/videos/ lectures/interviews/stories (on say YouTube).Do your own research and form your own opinions. Buying an e-reader may not be a bad investment. Add your local library to your list and get books loaded on your e-reader. 

Try to have a fun but frugal lifestyle. There will be enough time in your life to shop and spend. 

Try to find/expand your interests and invest in them. Travel, attend seminars/ conferences, make new friends, do some certifications, take up some courses...

Invest in a small business (could be run by a friend or relative). Take personal interest and try to help them with sales, hiring etc. It could be an art studio or a cycle workshop or even a flower shop. It is important to know the business and economics of things around you. 

#### Prithviraj Udaya, Entrepreneur

The book "Influence" by Robert Cialdini, totally changed my view about lot of things. Now my thirst for knowledge grew. I started buying and reading books on various fields.

Books on Startups, Business Models, Sales, Marketing, Psychology, Economics,  Neuroscience, History, Anthropology,  Criminology, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism fascinated me and gave me a new perspective on a lot of things.

Then I quit my job. Spent more time on reading all those books I purchased. Spent sometime in freelancing, was able to call people and get projects. Spent some time in creating some Web Products and marketed them. Was making some money. When you create something of your own and you sell it someone by your own effort and plans, you get some kind of joy which I am not able to explain. A salesman or an Entrepreneur who made their first sale, will understand what I am saying.

Now I have a confidence that I can somehow make money. This is a really important skill if you ask me. If you dont get a job, or you lose a job. It won't freak you out!

#### Peter Hartlen, Biz development guy

The most important thing to know is that time is really the most scarce of all resources and to treat it that way.  Remember the proverbial deathbed advice of successful men... I wish I spent more time more time with friends and family than in the office. 

So use your time well and don't waste it.  Try and find ways to multitask while doing things that you have to do that don't require attention.  If you have to wash the dishes... while you are doing that listen to an audiobook and learn something.  If you have to make a bunch of phonecalls.... take your phone and computer to the park and do it outside.  If you have to drive a long distance, spend the time on the phone with your family or old friends.  

#### Prajakt Raut, Entrepreneur and entrepreneurship evangelist 

If you are studying, learn to learn. Take up a course that excites you most. Something that pushes you to explore and learn new things. 

If you are working, or planning to work, take up a job that involves selling. Anything. But something that requires you to go into the field and sell. That experience is invaluable. Even when you fail to sale, you gain... because those failures make you battle-hardened to face challenges.

#### Paul Winslow, Minimalist, WordPress theme developer.

The same way a 32-year-old should invest their time. The same way a 52-year-old should invest their time, too. By closing the gap on your desired outcomes.

The secret to figuring out your desired outcomes: Always ask why? This  is how you filter out your nice-to-have goals from your must-have  goals. Your nice-to-have goals simply won't supply you with enough steam  to make it over the first hurdle.

You want more money? Awesome. So do the rest of us. But why? If you can't think of a really good answer then it's just a  nice-to-have. It's a flimsy target at best. If you can think of a  super-specific reason for wanting that outcome, and thinking about that  reason lights a fire in your belly, then BAM, you have a must-have  outcome. Write it down.

You can have outcomes in your relationships, your career, a personal project, your body.. whatever it is you need to do.

#### Morgan Ramsay

Network first, then make friends. You can always make friends, but the people who can help you now will not remain in the same position. They'll lose their jobs, climb the ladder, or remain in place while you move around, in or out of their reach. Moreover, professional relationships do not preclude friendships. In fact, your colleagues would probably make better friends than your drinking buddies who you know absolutely nothing about.

Gain competence in what you love; branch out later. If you've already found what you love, you shouldn't go looking for alternatives. Instead: practice, practice, and practice some more. When you think you're done, keep practicing. Once you've become proficient, explore other areas but only those that may have synergies with your primary domain. Stay focused.

Volunteer to help those who can help you. No amount of exposure to other people's "real problems" will prepare a 22-year-old to solve them. Perspective tugs on the heartstrings and rallies passionate believers around causes, but despite how cold and pragmatic this sounds, you can accomplish so much more for others once you're no longer worrying about yourself. Volunteer with a trade association, or intern with a company, where you can practice what you love and learn from people you respect.

Do whatever needs doing. Allowing yourself to be driven by genuine interest is perfectly fine if you're stuck in high school, but after you leave the safe confines of that teenage prison, you don't have a choice. You have to work for what you want. You have to act, not stand back and let good things happen to you. You have to do whatever needs doing and liking what must be done doesn't matter; being happy in every moment doesn't matter.


#### Others (sorry)

One very important thing that took me a while to pick up: sometimes the  real value is in the journey itself and the person you become for taking  it. Definitely learn to enjoy the process just as much as the outcome.

The time during your 20s will likely be the only time you have to yourself. Use that to your advantage and go travel the world, learn more about yourself, expand your world view. Go to each country, find local work to do for a while if you ran out of your savings and continue your journey.

Share your time with people who are in need, devote yourself to a worthy cause. This way you'll enjoy a better quality of life as you also build on how you will fare financially and career-wise.

If you ever plan to start a business, get serious now. No job will ever prepare you for what it take you to be the boss, to manage people and to make decisions on your own. The only job that can prepare you to be a CEO is being a CEO, even if you fail you win from the experience and the sooner you do it, the sooner you will start learning. If you want to get an MBA - try Europe for a one-year version. However you should only pursue you own business if you are incredibly resilient, are willing crawl through glass to get what you need done and are eternally optimistic about realistic goals. The first step is taking charge of your own life. We all work for someone - I just think it's better to work directly for the customer than what often ends up being some knucklehead.

Commit to learn at least 3 new skills every month. Commit to NOT have a career until you have had at least 6-12 jobs in different fields. Focus on understanding Real Estate, Money, Selling and Presentation. Take a different route home as often as possible. Travel.

You wouldn't belive me if I told you but...like many people, I was curious as hell about what it would be like to be naked in public. So...instead of wondering (like I know MOST people do...),

I said, "Fuck it", and did it. It was awesome. If I did it again, I'd make sure it's at a place where it's legal for me to be nude than risk getting caught (I had a very close call last time).

I listed this one last because...it's really not the most important aspect at this point in our lives. I used to be all work...no play. It cost me my late teens and early twenties, but it also made me the wiser in career and more successful -- it was a trade-off.

Make as few grounding decisions as possible (buying a house, marriage, etc...) and focus on option building  with expanded experiences (international travel, volunteer in places that are outside your routine, start meeting and getting to know people who are outside your usual circle of friends,....)  This not only makes your life much more fun and worthwhile - it also will give you so much more to think about, want to learn about -- not to get a better job/promotion, or to get a date...but to give your entire life more depth and help make the world more comfortable for you to live in and really enjoy. The more you connect outside your small, safe world - the less you live with fear and the more you live with wonder.

Ask people questions especially those you respect and listen. Reading books/blogs/online articles are great exercises to learn about various topics. Joining organizations such as an alumni club, ToastMasters, professional organizations, volunteer groups, religious organizations are other ways to learn and meet new people. Plus it helps one network professionally and one can also serve good causes with volunteer or religious groups. 

Friend up, not down.

In other words, invest time in becoming closer friends with those people in your life who are successful, who have accomplished what you wish to accomplish.    This strategy will pay off as you surround yourself with people who can contribute more to your success, financially and emotionally, than those who cannot.  These people will provide you with inspiration, mentoring, support, as well as friendship.

Make as many "mistakes" as you can. They will be forgiven at 22. They will not be at 44.

start a business, make your own money the worst thing you can do as a young adult is become reliant on a salary from someone else, you become permanently trapped in a "job" to maintain your lifestyle.

no matter what your passion is find the absolute best people in that field and find a way to be around them. 
if it's compsci, move to boston, if it's tech in general, get your ass in the valley, if it's really narrow, like "tech -> augmented reality", stalk the google-glass team. 
if you are in good company all the little details like "blog daily, read voraciously, meditate weekly and learn-to-code" would come naturally.
