## For People Who Cause Harm

Excerpt From: Kim Scott. “Just Work.” Apple Books.
“Here is what I will say: by and large, if you are working to become more aware of when your biases, prejudices, and bullying harm others, and you are making real, visible efforts to change, you’re doing the most important thing you can to stay out of trouble.”


## “Recognizing Different Systems of Injustice”

- Brutal ineffectiveness: Coerce, demand conformity. Conformity - the way that bonuses and promotions are decided. Coercion - when no checks and balances hold the CEO accountable.
  - Conformity => Individuality: Bias interruption is a norm, code of conduct is well understood, and bias quantifiers are built into routine business procedures.
  - Coercion => Collaboration: There are consequences to bullying, checks and balances are structured, trusted reporting mechanisms are in place, culture of consent is understood.
- Self-righteous shaming: “We can—indeed, we must—hold people accountable for unjust attitudes and behaviors, but we should not attempt to coerce people into mimicking our own beliefs and ideas, tempting though it may be to try, abhorrent though we may find their prejudices. The problem is threefold. First, it doesn’t work. Yes, it may be possible to intimidate people into hiding their prejudiced beliefs, but that doesn’t change what they think; it just makes it more likely it will come out in destructive, insidious ways. Second, such bullying tactics violate the very principle of collaboration, even when they are employed in the name of morality. They land us in an unjust system I’ll call Self-Righteous Shaming. This brings us to the third problem. This system is unstable. We don’t have to respect prejudices that demand conformity; indeed, we must challenge them. But when we disrespect the people who hold them, then over time we are demanding conformity—ironically in the name of respecting individuality! We slide from Self-Righteous Shaming over to Brutal Ineffectiveness.”
