## How to: Get your favor granted

First, ask for a big favor you know your counterpart will refuse, then ask for a smaller amount. *Your counterpart will be more likely to agree to the second favor because he sees it as a reasonable compromise and you appear courteous and cooperative.*

## How to: Make someone forgive you

Whenever you know you’re in the wrong, admit it. Immediately. Always blame yourself and make sure that anyone else involved knows you are aware of your mistakes. *Blaming yourself for the mistake will confuse others who expect you to deny your role. Your counterpart will have prepared to criticize you, but will be left with nothing to say because you've already criticized yourself. This inspires them to be more generous when meting out forgiveness.*

This trick also works well because the person could not elevate themselves by attacking you, and what they can do to make themselves feel better is to forgive you.

## How to: Make a great first impression

A warm smile makes you seem more likeable while also broadcasting to others that you’re happy to see them, which puts the odds of them being happy to see you in your favor.

## How to: Always be prepared

The secret to being prepared is having a backup plan. When you're aiming for a goal, think positively about your current course, but have a slightly different goal prepared in case you want or need to adjust. *The real idea isn't the backup plan--it's the third alternative: Plan Z.*

Having a Plan Z is effective because it changes your mindset. Knowing that there is a back door even in the worst case scenario will give you the strength and the confidence to fearlessly pursue your first goal.

## How to: Be happier

Psychologists have proven that the feeling of gratitude improves your outlook on life. Things to record could be the birth of your child, a thoughtful present someone gave you, a kind stranger offering you her seat on the bus, or the 20 bucks you just found on the street.
