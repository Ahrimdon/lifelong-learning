# Focus -- The Hidden Driver of Excellence
[summary](http://www.intuyuconsulting.com.au/files/Focus_-the_hidden_driver_of_excellence.pdf)

## 1: The Subtle Faculty

- "People could pay keen attention if their motivation was high enough (but if they didn't care, they would nod off immediately).
- Your focus is your reality.

## 2: Basics

- Sensory distraction: Endless way of incoming stimuli our brain weeds out from the continuous wash of background sounds, shapes, and colours, tastes, smells, sensations.
- Emotional distraction: Mention of our name, emotional turmoil, relationship breakdowns.
- *Those who focus best are relatively immune to emotional turbulence, more able to stay unflappable in a crisis and to keep and even keel despite life's emotional waves.*

We learn best with focused attention.

- As we focus on what we are learning, the brain maps that information on what we already know, making new neural connections.
- Lacking focus, we store no crisp memory of what we are learning.
- The more our minds wander, the worse our comprehension.
- As we read, our mind constructs a mental model that lets us make sense of what we are reading and connects it to the universe of such models we already hold that bear on the same topic. This expanding web of understanding lies at the heart of learning.
- As we read a book, our brain constructs a network of pathways that embodies that set of ideas and experiences. *"Deep reading" requires sustained concentration and immersion in a topic rather than hopscotching from one to another, nabbing disconnected factoids.*

## 3: Attention Top and Bottom

The brain has two semi-independent, largely separate mental systems.

### Bottom-up mind:

- Massive computing power operating constantly to solve our problems.
- Involuntary, impulsive, executes our habitual routines.
- This favors short-term thinking, impulse and speedy decisions. Works well for survival, but poor habits such as overeating/gambling/addictions means that the system is out of whack.
- Requires low power to run, thus it takes priority.

### Top-down mind:

- Slower, voluntary and effortful. It can override automatc routines and emotionally driven impulses.
- Takes things one at a time and applies more thoughtful analysis.
- This evolved later on and it added stuff like self-awareness, reflection, deliberation, and planning to our skills.
- High consumption of energy, so the brain does not do this for long.
- This is why cognitive efforts like learning demand active attention.

*The more we practice and ritualize a routine, the more the routine gets passed off from the top-down mind to the bottom-up mind until it becomes more automatic. As we develop mastery of a perticular skill the less cognitive effor is required to perform it, thus freeing our attention fo the extras seen only among those at the top levels. Overloading attention shrinks mental control. More errors occur when we are distracted, stressed, or mentally burdened.*

*Emotional resilience comes down to how quickly we recover from upsets. People who are highly resilient have developed their left pre-frontal area to overcome any hijacking by our emotions. Active engagement in attention inhibits mindless mental habits.*

## 4: The Value of a Mind Adrift

*Our mind being adrift is the default mode of our brain and it allows our creative juices to flow.* Among the positive functions of a mind wandering are generating scenarios for the future, self-reflection, navigating a complex social world, incubation of creative ideas, and giving our circuitry for more intensive focusing a refreshing break.

Classic model of the stages of creativity translates to three modes of focus:

- Orienting: Where we search out and immerse ourselves in all kinds of input.
- Selective attention: On the specific creative challenge.
- Open awareness: Where we associate freely to let the solution emerge.

In a complex world where almost everyone has access to the same information, new value arises from the original synthesis, from putting ideas together in novel ways, from smart questions that open up untapped potential. Creative insights entail joining elements in a useful, fresh way.

"The power of small wins" found that creative insights flowed best when people had clear goals but also the freedom in how they reached them. And, the most crucial, they had protected time – enough to think freely. The key to breakthroughs in thinking is having small wins – minor innovations and troubling problems solved – on concrete steps towards a larger goal.

## 5: Finding Balance

- *The most powerful distractor is not the chatter of people around us, but the chatter of our own minds.* Utter concentration demands these inner voices be stilled.
- Mindfulness quiets the default chatter of the mind, it quiets the brain circuitry for me-focused mental chatter.
- Situations that do not demand constant task-focus (boring/routine ones) free the mind to wander. As the mind drifts off, our neural circuits for task-focus go quiet.
- Tightly focused attention gets fatigued – much like an overworked muscle – when we push to the point of cognitive exhaustion. The signs of mental fatigue, such as a drop in effectiveness and the rise of distractedness and irritability, signify that the mental effort needed to sustain focus has depleted the glucose that feeds neural energy.
- To restore our mental energy we need to switch from effortful attention, where the mind needs to suppress distractions, to letting go and allowing our attention to be captured by whatever presents itself. Disengagement is the first step: full focusing on something relaxing where we arouse the sensory systems (walking in the park, playing with your children, nothing that requires effortful focus).

## 6: The Inner Rudder

- The people who have a strong inner compass have self-awareness as the key.
- Steve Jobs' "don't let the voice of others' opinions drown out your inner voice".
- Our "gut feelings" are messages from the insula and other bottom-up circuits that simplify life decisions for us by guiding our attention towards smarter options. The better we are at reading these messages, the better our intuition.

## 7: Seeing ourselves as others see us.

- One surefire test for self-awareness is a 360 degree evaluation. The gap between how you see yourself and how others rate you offers one of the best evaluations you can get anywhere of your own self-awareness.
- *Self-awareness appears to diminish with promotions up the organizational ladder. This may be because the higher people rise in an organization, the smaller the circle of others willing or courageous enough to speak to them honestly about their quirks.*
- Our sense of self dawns in our social interactions. Other people are our mirrors, reflecting us back to ourselves. *I am what you think I am.*
- *Whne people receive negative performance feedback in a warm supportive tone of voice, they leave feeling positive, despite the negative feedback. But when they have positive performance reviews in a cold/distant tone of voice, they end up feeling bad despite the good news.*
- When the tendency to ignore evidence to the contrary spreads into a shared self-deception, it becomes groupthink. The unstated need to protect a treasured opinion (by discounting crucial disconfirming data) drives shared blind spots that lead to bad decisions.
- It takes meta-cognition to bring to light what the group has buried in a grave of indifference or suppression. *Clarity begins with realizing what we do not notice, and don't notice what we don't notice.*
- Candid feedback from those you trust and respect creates a source of self-awareness, one that can help guard against skewed information inputs or questionable assumptions.
- To fix groupthink: Expand your circle of connections beyond your comfort zone and build a circle of no-BS confidants who keep you honest.

## 8: A Receipt for Self-Control

### Our mind

- Meta-cognition (thinking about thinking). We know how our mental operations are going and we adjust them as needed.
- Meta-emotion does the same with regulating the flow of feeling and impulse.
- In the mind's design, self-awareness is built into regulating our own emotions, as well as sensing what others feel.

### Executive attention

How we focus holds the key to willpower. Willpower is:

- The ability to voluntarily disengage our focus from an object of desire that powerfully grabs our attention.
- The ability to resist distraction and keep our focus elsewhere.
- The ability to keep our focus on a goal in the future.

*Willpower was an independent force in life success--in fact, for financial success, self-control in childhood proved a stronger predictor tha either IQ or social class of the family or origin. The better the self-control in childhood, the sounder their health, finances, and their relationship to crime and the law.*

Anything we can do to increase our children's capacity for cognitive control will help them throughout life. Attention has a limited capacity: working memory creates a bottleneck that lets us hold just so much in our mind at any given moment. As our worries intrude on the limited capacity of our attention, these irrelevant thoughts shrink the bandwidth left for learning. The ability to notice that we are getting anxious and to take steps to renew our focus rests on self-awareness.

Willpower keeps us focused on our goals despite the tug of our impulses, passions, habits, and cravings. *Those who have been successful at losing weight and keeping it off exhibit the most cognitive control when facing a calorie laden morsel.*

## 10: The Empathy Triad

Three aspects of empathy (the ability to focus on what other people experience).

- Cognitive empathy: Allows us to take other people's perspective, comprehend their mental state, and at the same time manage our own emotions while we take stock of theirs.
- Emotional empathy: We join the other person in feeling along with them; our body resonates in whatever key of joy or sorrow the person is going through.
- Empathetic concern: Leads us to care about the person, mobilizing us to help if need be and builds upon the caring and attachment bottom-up systems we have.

Our circuitry for empathy was designed for face-to-face interactions so online interactions pose special challenges. We rely more on cognitive empathy in non-face-to-face interactions.

### Cognitive Empathy

- Mostly top-down (impulsive).
- An inquisitive nature, which predisposes us to learn from everybody, feeds our cognitive empathy, amplifying our understanding of other people's worlds. It blooms around two-five years of age and continues to develop through the teen years. However, to understand the feeling of others, you need to understand your own feelings.

### Emotional Empathy

- These circuits tune in by arousing in our own body the emotional state picked up in the other person.
- Story telling can couple listeners with the storyteller. More overlap in neural coupling, the better the listener's understanding of the story.
- Shared rapport between a learner and the teacher can put the child's brain in the best mode for learning.
- We can become good readers of other's emotions by tuning in to ourselves because as our emotional empathy capacity grows, our body can mirror others' emotions in our body.
- The more self-aware we become, the more we can have emotional empathy for others.

### Empathetic Concern

- Compassion builds on empathy, which in turn requires a focus on others. If self-absorbed, we simply do not notice other people.
- In mammals, this circuitry compels attention and concern towards babies and the young and arises more strongly when we become parents.
- The more we are distracted/tired, the less we can exhibit attunement and caring. The need to compete can sometimes suppress empathetic concern as well.
- The more empathetic the interaction, the more a person feels heard and cared for.

# 11: Social Sensitivity

Culture aside, ground rules shift greatly depending on who you are with. We can have different social cues and norms within different communities that we belong to. What may be appropriate in one community may not be appropriate in another. *Attention to context lets us pick up the subtle social cues that can guide how we behave.*

People who excel at organizational influence can not only sense the flow of personal connections but also names the people whose opinions hold the most sway--and so, when they need to, focus on convincing those who will in turn persuade others.

*There are invisible signs of social status and powerlessness--the powerful tend to tune out the powerless--and that deadens empathy.*

- We focus on the people we value most.
- Poor people are particularly attentive to other people and their needs because they depend on good relationships with friends and family whom you may need to turn to for help.
- Wealthy people can afford to be less aware of the needs of other people, and so can be less attentive to them and their suffering.
- *The more you care about someone, the more attention you pay--and the more attention you pay, the more you care.*

# 13: System Blindness

In a system, there are no "side effects"--there are just effects, anticipated or not. Quite often, we are blind to the dynamics of a system because we are not aware of the whole system.

In a complex system, cause and effect may be more distant in time and space than we realize.

One of the worst results of system blindness occurs when leaders implement a strategy to solve a problem, but ignore the system dynamics (possible causes of the problems).

Ex: You can just solve traffic jams with wider roads, because this leads to more jams and delay when mass transport loses viability. Our incomplete mental models about traffic jams arise when we fail to take into account the system dynamics of road systems.

*Our perceptions and mental models are tuned and molded by what helped our forerunners survive in the wild, but not to the system effects humans are having on our environment. This is why some people reject "the effect of humans on this world" (they perceive only the local, not the systemic effect.)*

# 14: Distant Threats

- Negative focus leads to discouragement and disengagement. When our neural centers for distress take over, our focus shifts to the distress itself, and how to ease it.
- What we measure we pay more attention to and have goals around.
- *Trial and error, reverse engineering stuff in your mind, that is the kind of thinking that schools should be teaching. As the world becomes more complex, games are becoming better at preparing kids to analyze the ground rules of an unknown reality and operate in the increasingly complex environment.*
- *Kids are natural system thinkers. Why not embed systems literacy in the increasingly complex environment?*

# 15: The myth of 10,000 hours

- You don't get benefits by mechanical repetition, but by adjusting your execution over and over to get closer to your goal. You have to tweak the system by pushing, allowing more errors at first as you increase your limits.
- *The secret of winning is "deliberate practice", where an expert coach takes you through well-designed training over months or years, and you give it your full concentration.*
- Hours are not enough. Experts practiced with full concentration on improving a particular aspect of their performance that a master teacher identified.
- Smart practice always includes a feedback loop that lets you recognize errors and correct them.
- When practice occurs while we are focusing elsewhere, the brain does not rewire the relevant circuitry for that particular routine. *Daydreaming defeats practice.*
- *Experts keep paying attention to top-down for longer, concentrating actively on those moves they have yet to perfect, correcting what's not workoing, refining their mental models, or focusing on particular feedback from a seasoned coach. Those at the top never stop learning.*
- *Focused attention, like a strained muscle, gets fatigued.* World-class competitors build in rest and restoring physical and mental energy as part of their training regimen. Optimal practice maintains optimal concentration.
- When it comes to application of attention, it takes doggedness. You need persistence even though it may be boring.
- Specific muscles respond to particular training regimens, so it is with attention training. Concentration on one point of focus is the basic attention builder, but that strength can be applied in many different ways. In the mental gym, the specifics of practice make all the difference.
- A focus on our strengths urges us toward a desired future and stimulates openness to new ideas, people, and plans. Spotlighting our weaknesses elicits a defensive sense of obligation and guilt, closing us down.
- Coaching with a positive bias that begins with a person's dreams and goals that lead to a learning path that yields that vision are far more effective than those that focus on a person's weakness.

# 17: Breathing Buddies

- It makes a difference to teach students to self-regulate rather than relying on punishments and rewards.
- We help students learn how to put their problems in perspective and develop strategies to resolve them. They can match the problem to the strategy.
- *The big lesson for the kids is to tune in and know what to do to care for yourself.*
- The children who needed the greatest help (those at "high-risk" for derailing in life)--benefited the most, in that they had significant boosts in attention/perceptual sensitivity, drops in aggressiveness, downbeat moods and frustration with school.
- Teachers increased their sense of well-being!
- *Kids who can ignore impulse, filter out what's irrelevant, and stay focused on a goal fare best in life.*
- *Being able to name your feelings and put that together with your memories and associations turns out to be crucial for self-control.*
- *By teaching kids the skills that help them to calm down and focus, we lay the foundation of self-awareness and self-management on which you can scaffold the other social and emotional learning skills such as active listening, identifying feelings, and so on.*

## Benefits of Mindfulness

- Boosts the attention network in your brain's system that works to allocate attention.
- Improves selective attention, inhibiting the pull of distractors and focus on what's important to us.
- Improves the ability of students to understand since wandering minds punch holes in comprehension.
- People are able to manage both their attention and their emotions better, and thus are more able to create positive relationships and have their effective interactions.
- Mindfulness develops our capacity to observe our moment-to-moment experience in an impartial, non-reactive manner.
- Mindfulness training decreases activity in me-circuitry and the less self-talk the more we can experience the moment.

# 18: How Leaders Direct Attention

- Directing attention towards where it needs to go is a primal task of leadership. Talent lies in the ability to shift attention to the right place at the right time, sensing trends and emerging realities and seizing opportunities.
- Attention tends to focus on what has meaning/what matters. The story a leader tells can imbue a particular focus with such resonance, and so implies a choice for the others on where to put their attention and energy. Leadership itself hinges on effectively capturing and directing the collective attention.
- The best leaders have systems awareness (an outer focus) and the ability to communicate that understanding with passion and skill, drawing on cognitive and emotional empathy (inner focus). It drives how you deal with values, vision, mission, strategy, goals, tactics, deliverables, evaluation, and the feedback loop that restarts the whole process.

# 19: The Leader's Triple Focus

- Successful leaders are constantly seeking out new information. They want to understand the territory they operate in. They need to be alert to new trends, and to spot emerging patterns that might matter to them.
- Leaders who inspire can articulate shared values that resonate and motivate the group. These are leaders people love to work with, who surface the vision that moves everyone. But to speak from the heart, to the heart, a leader must first know her values.
- Inspiring leadership demands attuning both to an inner emotional reality and to that of those we seek to inspire.
- The common cold of leadership is poor listening – it has links to a lack of empathy and also the ability to stop our self-talk. We pay attention in moments that matter most to us. But amid the din and distraction of work life, poor listening has become epidemic.
- To anticipate how people will react, you have to read people's reactions to you. That takes self-awareness and empathy in a self-reinforcing cycle. You become more aware of how you’re coming across to other people.
- With high self-awareness you can readily develop good self-management. If you manage yourself better, you will influence better.

# 20: What makes a good leader?

- *Once you are in a given job amongst your peers, specific competencies like self-discipline, empathy, and persuasion are far stronger forces in success than IQ.*
- Outstanding leaders are those who show strength in a range of non-cognitive competencies (empathy, self-awareness, thinking globally, creating an inspiring shared vision, embracing change, persistence, resilience, drive to achieve goals, etc.)

To mentor and advise someone to be a leader means:

- Listening within, to articulate an authentic vision of overall direction that energises others even as it sets clear expectations.
- Coaching, based on listening to what people want from their life, career, and current job. Paying attention to people's feelings and needs, and showing concern.
- Listening to advice and expertise; being collaborative and making decisions by consensus when appropriate.
- Celebrating wins, laughing, knowing that having a good time together is not a waste of time but a way to build emotional capital.
