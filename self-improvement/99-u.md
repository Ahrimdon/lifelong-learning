## BrenÃ© Brown: Why Your Critics Aren't The Ones Who Count

I'm a researcher and I study connection, vulnerability, love, and I realize why you are my tribe. I think it is because design is a function of connection. There is nothing more vulnerable than creativity, and what is art if it is not love? So it made sense for me to be here.

I know what the perspiration feels like when I create. I will talk about the perspiration that no one talks about, and it's the perspiration from fear. So I know about sweaty creatives. Sometimes when you hear something when you're ready to hear it.

I did a Ted Talk and it went viral and the marching orders from the therapist/husband was to not read the comments online, and I read the comments online lol. The comments weren't about work, they were about me. They were the things that creative people play in their mind and they give up doing what they do. What would you try if you knew someone would never say it about you?

"Of course she embraces imperfection, look at how she looks." "I'm sorry for her kids." "More research, less botox." Just mean personal attacks that up until that moment had inspired me to stay very small in my life and in my career. So I watched Downtown Abbey for 8 hours. So I research who the president was during the Downtown Abbey time and I see this quote abotu Theodore Roosevelt and it's a quote about a speech he gave:

> It's not the critic who counts. It's not the man that points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done it better. The credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with blood and sweat and dust, who at the best in the end knows the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, he fails daring greatly.

It is not about winning, not about losing, it's about showing up and being seen.

This is what I want to be. I want to create. I want to make things that didn't exist before. I want to show up and be seen in my work and in my life. If you want to show up and be seen, there is only one guarantee: you will get your ass kicked. That is the only guarantee and certainty you have. Especially if you commit to creating in your life.

If courage is a value that we hold, this is a consequence.

The third thing is a new philosophy about criticism: "If you're not in the arena, also getting your ass kicked, I'm not even considering your feedback." If you have constructive feedback, then let's do it. But if you're in the cheap seats, not putting yourself on the line, and just talking about how I can do it better, I am in no way interested about your feedback.

This (backstage) is where we sweat. This is where I dream about when I come up. And the fear is this: "I'm scared", a lot of self-doubt, comparison, anxiety, uncertainty, and what do most people do when they walk into the arena, you armore up. But god that stuff is heavy. And that stuff is suffocating. And when you armor up against vulnerability, you shut yourself up.

When you armor up, in this hallway, you shut yourself off from everything you do and you love, because vulnerability is certainly a part of fear and self-doubt and uncertainty and shame, but it's also the birthplace of love, joy, belonging, trust, empathy, creativity, and innovation. Without vulnerability, you cannot create.

So what I think you are asked to do is to walk to this hall, get to the top of the stairs, and get naked. Get real. Put yourself out there and so people can see what you've made.

When we walk out, we see lots of seats, lots of people, but we focus on the critics. I used to think the best way to put your work out in the world is to make sure the critics are not in the arena. But you have no control over who is in the arena. And the best way I have found is to know that they are there, and to know exactly what they're going to say to you. You know the three seats that will always be taken are shame, scarcity, and comparison.

Shame, completely universal human emotion, we all have it. It's the one that whispers, "you're not enough." Shame always has a seat.

The other seat that's always taken is scarcity. "What am I doing that's original? Everyone is already doing this. 150 people are doing it who are better trained than I am. What am I contributing. Does this really matter?" 

The third seat is comparison. Comparison is a nightmare. It is always there.

The fourth seat is left open, is it a teacher, a parent, a shitty ex-coworker? The thing is I don't care what people think sends a huge red flag to me. We are hardwired for connection, when we stop caring what people think, we lose our capacity for connection, when we get defined by what people think, we lose our capacity to be vulnerable. Not caring what people think is its own kind of hustle.

Rather than locking people out of the arena, I would rather reserve seats for them. Reserve a seat, take the critics to lunch, and tell them I see you, I hear you, but I'm going to show up and do this anyway, but I've got a seat for you and you're welcome to come, and I'm not interested in your feedback.

To me, if you're going to spend your life in the arena, there is a couple of things you need. __The first is a clarity of values.__ I know I can screw this completely up, but I don't have a choice, because courage is my value, and I have to do this. Whether it is successful or not is irrelevant.

The other is you got to have at least one person in your life who is willing to pick you up and dust you up when you fail, which hopefully you will because if you're not failing you're not showing up, and say "man, that sucked, but you're brave, and let's get you clean up and let's get in". They should have great seats in your arena.

The last part is the world keeps going whether you know it or not. The critics in the arena are there, and they're there whether you do it or not. The people who have the most courage are the people who are very clear who the critics are. The last thing which I think is the hardest is that one of these seats needs to be reserved for you. When we look up and we're putting our idea and we're putting our design forwards, the biggest critic is usually yourself.

Definitely me. I have never watched either of those Ted Talks because what would it serve me? We're so self-critical and one of the things that happens is there is an ideal of what you're supposed to be and we orphan the parts of ourselves that don't fit with our ideal supposed to be. What it leaves is it just leaves the critic. 

Reserved in this seat is this: Where we came from, how we started, our families, the lost years (when I was hurt and disillusioned), the people who love us, the people who make us who we are, and the person who believes in what we're doing and why we're doing it and the person who says, "yeah, it's so scary to show up, it feels dangerous to be seen, it's terrifying, but it is not as scary, dangerous, or terrifying as getting to the end of our lives, and thinking what if I would have shown up, what if it had been different?"
