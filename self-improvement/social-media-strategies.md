## Context is Key: Social Media Strategy in a Noisy Online World

Oliver C's notes.

- Give, give, give, and then right hook → don’t ask until you’ve given people so much value that they almost feel guilted into returning the favor when you ask
- The amount of value you have to give to somebody before asking for something is completely predicated on the brand
  - Everyone is a media business → no different than fashion, we wear clothes, shoes, style, hair for a very specific reason...to tell who we are
  - Let it come from your heart, this works a lot better
  - There’s an oversupply of content (more supply of content than demand for it)
  - You actually have to be the best to break through now, gotta be on your A game
- The Mothership: Facebook
  - Facebook has the scale, hits everybody, you can target people so specifically because it has literally everybody
  - You can just focus on telling your story Facebook and it would be okay
  - Just the sheer volume of it makes it the most important
  - It will still be relevant for at least another couple years even though it’s not the coolest platform anymore
  - Facebook is a picture platform (Instagram, tried to buy Snapchat)
  - When you put out a picture, it better have your company’s logo
  - Think about this from a mobile perspective
  - Don’t write novels in your posts
  - If you’re trying to drive people to your website, put the hyperlink in the copy
  - Ask yourself, “Does anybody care?” before you post
  - Put out compelling content so people actually engage
  - When you go for the right hook, be direct → “Buy”, “Download”, “Read”, etc.
  - You need to go all in
  - You can do the creative, you can have an agenda, but there are other variables
  - Facebook Case Study: Reggie Bush
    - When you’re a celebrity and always polished, a little humanity (imperfection) goes a long way → have to be vulnerable
  - Asking a question goes a long way
    - Likes, comments, shares → engagement is the only way to measure success
  - 26 to 52 right hooks a year is a good range

- Instagram: hottest of all social networks
  - No virality as of time of video (maybe hashtags now) → liking and commenting doesn’t add to virality, no real snowballing of posts because they’re confined to your followers
  - More authentic because it’s limited, not as spammy
  - High end or strategic thinking → the only people who will see your content are those who have signed up to see it already
  - Hashtag culture
  - Posting something that doesn’t get engagement is negative media → just noisy
  - Not a lot of right hooks

- Statogram for analytics
- Pinterest
  - Pinterest is intent to buy, and aspirational (what people hope to buy)
  - Challenging because it’s a social network grounded in search DNA (more influenced by Google than Facebook)
  - You need high quality photos, utilitarian photos → infographics get shared
  - Core piece of content links out to a URL
  - Pin is a really powerful tool, not based on recentness
  - Perfect place for right hooks, figure out how to get involved in the community, repin things, learn the lexicons, real deal
  - Great place for infographic
  - A lot of people who throw right hooks on Pinterest send you to an information page, don’t do this, send them to the product

- Tumblr
  - Created a platform for people to be creative and share their interests
  - Doesn’t matter how many followers you have, just matters what you put out there
  - If you’re gonna story tell on Tumblr, you need to be strategic in how tell your story and what you want to communicate and do it in GIFs
  - If you’re not making GIFs, don’t get into Tumblr
  - GIFs of very best part of interviews, link to full interviews
  - Don’t walk into a room if you’re not acting cool
  - The number one thing we are is lazy → this is a good mentality to have when creating content

- Twitter - the one true cocktail party of social media, you can jump into anyone’s conversations
  - The one place where you get more credit for listening than talking
  - You can jump into conversations and won’t sound creepy
  - If you’re not doing your fair share of listening and engaging, you’re not going to be successful on Twitter
  - Twitter has a firehose problem, oversupply of content
  - When you retweet people saying nice things about you, it’s bragging
  - Just isn’t attractive, doesn’t add value
  - Don’t start a tweet with someone’s Twitter handle
  - Use the trends to make hashtags, don’t just do a random hashtag, use one that’s trending
