## Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with The New Science of Success

- Wake up at 6am, 9 mile run, go to school, lift weights, then run another 9 miles at 6pm. Rigid diet and religiously went to bed hours before his peers.
- Running 100 miles during a week-long cruise vacation. Ran through tropical storms, summer heat advisories, family emergencies.
- 10pm bedtime over opportunities to meet girls.
- Steve: the runner, now a performance scientist and budding coach of endurance athletes, and Brad: emerging writer.

### Great Expectations

- All-out war for good jobs.
- An increasingly number of people in the world are miserable, hopeless, suffering, and becoming dangerously unhappy.
- Athletes in timed events have become better every year.
- Increased Adderall usage in professionals.
- There are high school students who use human growth hormone (HGH).
- PEDs are used by weekend warriors/middle-aged men.
- Overtraining athletes.

### The Secret to Sustainable Success

- You need to find and lift the Goldilocks weight: an amount you can barely manage, that will leave you exhausted and fatigued, but not injured, by the time you've finished your workout. Stress + rest = growth.
- 10-12 hours of sleep, diet, weekly massage and stretching sessions.
- Flow: The brightest minds spend their time either pursuing an activity with ferocious intensity, or engaging in complete restoration and recovery.
  - Immersion: Total engagement in their work.
  - Incubation: A period of rest and recovery.
  - Insight: The emergence of new ideas.
- Participants who were forced to flex their mental muscle performed worse on a subsequent task that also required mental energy as compared to participants in a control group who has an easy first task.
- **Even if their bodies are fresh, the physical performance of people who are mentally fatigued suffers.**
- Weakened self-control re: food deprivation can lead to infidelity.
- **The more we resist temptation, think deeply, or focus intensely, the better we become at doing so.** Willpower in particular is not as limited as scientists once thought, and by successfully completing smaller productive changes, we can build the strength to complete larger ones in the future.
- **Stress + rest = growth.**
- Josh Waitzkin: Chess and martial arts (tai chi) master.

### Rethinking Stress

- Lifting a heavy weight--results in a micro-tear in the muscle's tissue.
- If the stress is too much, the body fails to adapt. The muscle deteriorates. Catabolic struggle.
- The most effective tutoring systems delayed instruction until students reached the point of failure. Growth comes at the point of resistance. Skills come from struggle.
- "During training, I seek out and try to ride waves that scare me. It's only when you step outside your comfort zone that you grow. Being uncomfortable is the path to personal development and growth. It's the opposite of complacency."
- System 2 Learning: System 1 is our default, since it requires less energy, and System 2 is done by working hard and struggling to figure something out. True learning requires System 2.
  - System 1 = because we are using the connections in our brain that we have used before.
- **A little doubt and uncertainty is actually a good thing: It signals that a growth opportunity has emerged.**

### Stress Yourself

- The best violinists spent significantly more time intensely focused on mastering a specific goal, and remained totally present when doing so.
- They eliminated all distractions. They rarely just went through the motions.
- They were practicing far more "deliberately" than everyone else.
- Deep concentration. When great performers are doing serious work, their bodies and minds are 100 percent there. They are fully engaged in the moment.
- Dr. Bob: Renaissance man, he does only one thing at a time and devotes his full concentration to that one thing. The ultimate single-tasker.
- Best method for self-control: move the object of desire out of view.
- Great workers generally work in chunks of 60 to 90 minutes, separated by short breaks.
- Stress: See it as a challenge, not as something bad.
- Olympians view tournaments with determination and are not stressed that much when starting.

### The Paradox of Rest

- Mindfulness meditation.
- Fully present--all movements have intention. Even opening a Macbook, he looked like a 4-year old discovering a Macbook for the first time.
- Mindfulness meditation increases gray matter in the part of the rain called the prefrontal cortex.
- When we challenge ourselves--whether by running a hard workout, learning how to play a new instrument, or working tirelessly to solve a complex problem--we are triggering a stress response in the brain.
- **By strengthening our prefrontal cortex, mindfulness allows us to recognize that we are having a stress response rather than automatically being overcome by it.** Itâ€™s as if we are viewing our thoughts and feelings as a neutral observer and then choosing what to do next. A weak prefrontal cortex gets overpowered by a strong stress response. But a strong prefrontal cortex lets us choose how we want to respond to stress.
- Expert meditators: they are able to turn off their stress response, disassociating the stimulus from an extended emotional reaction.
- Elite runners are also good when responding to stress.
- When pain sets in during a hard, long workout, runners get wrapped up in it. For the best runners, they feel discomfort, but they make it a calm conversation.
- "This is starting to hurt now. It should. I'm running hard. But I am separate from this pain. It is going to be okay."
- Accept that every hard workout or race is going to hurt.
- "When it started to hurt, I imagined you were next to me, just like in practice. It was like I was having a simple conversation in the middle of the race, first with you, and then with myself. When it started to get really difficult, I didn't try to force my way through the pain or fight against it. Instead, I reminded myself that this is normal and I relaxed."
- HRV (heart rate variability), the space between heart beats, as proof. The faster someone's HRV returns to its pre-exercise value, the better. Following hard training, the HRV of elite athletes returns to baseline far faster than the HRV of non-elites.
- When people zone out and daydream, a particular part of the grain consistently became active, the default-mode network. Even when it feels that our brains are "off", a powerful default-mode network is running in the background.

### Rest Like the Best

- Regardless of the task at hand, our output begins to suffer after 2 consecutive hours of hard work.
- Short walking break, those who took as brief as a 6-minute walk outdoors increased creativity by more than 60 percent versus those who had remained seated at their desks.
- Even those who walked in doors generated about 40% more creative ideas than those who didn't walk at all.
- Increased blood flow to the brain?
- The benefits might also stem from the interplay between walking and attention. Since walking requires just enough coordination, it distracts our conscious mind. This is why walking tends to be more effective at fostering creativity than other movements that require greater focus and coordination, like dancing or lifting weights.
- Those who took a break in a natural setting out-performed those who took their break in an urban setting. **Even looking at pictures can help.**
- Social recovery: team breakfasts, lunches, or movie/game nights. A friendly post-exercise setting seems to help with recovery and future performance.
- The basic biology of feeling connected to others has profound effects on stress physiology. The positive effects of social connection include increasing heart rate variability, shifting the nervous system into recovery mode, and releasing hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
- Yes there is a scientific basis to get drinks with friends.
- Sleep's critical role in learning is a new discovery--people thought that the only known function of sleep was to cure sleepiness. Even amnesiacs reported dreaming of Tetris.
- Chronically sleep-deprived individuals have less self-control and are at increased risk for "succumbing to impulsive desires, poor attentional capacity, and compromised decision making".
- The longer we sleep, the greater the proportion of it is in REM. **Hours 7-9 are actually the most powerful.**
- As we sleep, our brains replay, process, learn, and extract meaning. In a sense, they think.
- Outside magazine great performers: there is a huge variability in their daily habits, but the topic where there is complete conformity is sleep. The best athletes in the world all prioritize sleep just as much as they prioritize their hardest training sessions and their most important competitions.
- When we've slept for an hour, anabolic hormones flood our system--testosterone and human growth hormone are both released after the first REM cycle and stay elevated until we wake. These hormones increase protein synthesis, or the generation of proteins specifically designed to facilitate physical repair.
- You absolutely need to train hard to get better. But sneaking in that extra hour of training at the expense of sleep is rarely a good idea.
- Naps can improve performance, alertness, concentration, and judgment.
- Sleep scientists found that a 10-minute nap yields the greatest benefits.
- During the process of writing this book, we held each other to taking at least one day-off a week. On that day we didn't write or research a word.
- **The savviest professionals schedule big meetings on Tuesdays instead of Mondays.**
- Much like rest days should be timed to follow accumulated stress, so too should vacations.
- Research shows that breaks lasting 7-10 days have positive effects on motivation, well-being, and health that last up to a month. But if the conditions that led to burnout in the first place aren't resolved, the symptoms of burnout inevitably return just a few weeks later.
- **Regardless of the work you do, take at least 1 off-day every week. On those days, truly disconnect from work.**
- Stress + rest = growth.
- Ingesting 20-30 grams of protein prior to sleep increases protein synthesis overnight.

### Optimize Your Routine

- "The zone": a mindset where he doesn't dwell on mistakes or gets distracted by the crowd.
- Warming up to the drums: not drumming, but push ups and jumping jacks.
- When going up on the stage, he is physically alert and psychologically zone in.
- Subjects in the positive group were significantly more  likely to solve challenging intellectual problems with creative insight. Those in positive moods = increased activity in a region of the brain associated with decision making and emotional control.
- **You can improve performance by priming yourself into a positive mood prior to important work that involves problem solving and creating thinking.**
- Just being exposed to happy faces for a fraction of a second has a 12% better performance than those exposed to the sad faces.
- Psychological priming: reading the author's favorite books.
- The mental state preceding a performance can considerable affect it.
- Stephen King's writing setup: everything is intentional, from the room he writes in, to the placement of his desk, to the materials on it, to the music he listens to.
- Ecological psychology: the specific places in which we work in matter. Our brains are engaged in an intricate conversation with the objects that surround us, and the more they converse, the tighter the back and forth becomes.
- Being intentional about our surroundings is essential to eliciting our best performance. The things we work among become "expansion of the self".
- When an object like a computer is isolated for a specific task, like writing, the link between subject (writer) and object (computer) strengthens.
- **Don't wait for the muse. - Stephen King** You use your routine to ready yourself to get in the zone. Your schedule exists in order to habituate yourself.
- B.F. Skinner - the ultimate creature of habit. Skinner's own routine served as a trigger to cure the behavior of writing, which was reinforced by the positive emotions he felt after being productive.
- Higher testosterone: some got it after running short and fast, some after running long and slow, some after prepping on their own, some after warming up in a group, and so forth. But all had the highest levels if they felt good. We just want to make sure that every individual athlete felt confident and her mind and body were ready.

### Minimalist to be a Maximalist

- Block off between 60 and 90 minutes every day to read outside of his domain.
- This does not men you have to be narrow or overly specialized. You should be fully intentional with how you spend your most precious resource of all: time.
- Same workout clothes and work clothes as it is every day. Then, he rides his bike to a gym located near his office. "I am very intentional about selecting where to live. I didn't want to waste time commuting, nor willpower dealing with traffic."
- "In order to do great work, you need to say no to a lot of things so that when it's time to say yes, you can do so with all your energy."
- "I feel like I'm not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous about my life."
- Decision fatigue. Each time we make a deliberate decision, our brain is processing different scenarios and evaluating all the options. As the decisions we make add up, so too does the amount of processing required by our brain. And just like any other muscle would, our mental muscle gets tired.
- We should realize that we have limited energy and devote it only to things that really matter.
- Don't devote brainpower to gossip, politics, or worrying about what others think of you.
- All of them have a routine, but these routines varied significantly. Some did their best work late into the night.
- While perform best on work that demands deep focus and attention during our peak hours, the opposite holds true for generating creative ideas.
- Great performers schedule their hardest and most demanding deep-focus work during periods in which they are the most alert. When their attention really begins to wane, they don't force themselves to keep working.
- **While there was variability in fitness gains/losses across all the cadets, there was hardly any variability within squadrons. The determining factor as to whether the 30 cadets within a squadron improved was the motivation of the least fit person in the group.**
- Those who were assigned to watch the people describing themselves as intrinsically motivated reported feeling more intrinsically motivated themselves.
- The importance of building a "village" of the right personal and professional supporters.
- Showing up: The best performers are not consistently great, but they are great at being consistent.
- Haruki Murakami: Wake up at the same time, work for 5-6 hours, then run 4 kilometers or swim for 1500 meters, then read a bit and listen to music then sleep at 9pm.

### Transcend your Self

- Acts of superhuman strength always occur in life-or-death situations.
- When people focus on a self-transcending purpose, or a purpose greater than themselves, they become capable of more than they ever thought was possible.
- Muscles running out of gas--if this was true, then why would athletes still be able to speed up during the final stretch of a race when the end was in sight.
- Physical fatigue occurs not in the body , but in the brain.
- Reflecting on core values: heightened neural activity in the part of the brain associated with "positive valuation."
- The belief that one's job had a positive impact on others was associated with better performance.
- We constantly weigh our perceptions of effort associated with an activity against our motivation to do that activity. When perception of effort is greater than motivation, we slow down or ease up until the two are balanced.
- **Purpose fosters motivation; motivation lets us endure a greater perception of effort; and enduring a greater perception of effort often results in better performance.**
- **Burnout is intimately linked to our fight-or-flight stress response. After a prolonged period of too much stress, our "flight" trigger kicks in, urging us to flee from whatever is causing the stress.**
- Possible solution to burnout: "giving back" to your field. Volunteering, mentoring, but you should focus on helping others.
- By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system.

### Develop your purpose

- Visual cues: puts his purpose on the handlebars of his bike. Whenever the pace and associated pain picks up, his natural inclination is to drop his head and look down. Every time he does that, he'll be looking at his purpose: "to inspire other people to get out of their comfort zones and live life to its fullest."
- "To make a difference in the lives of human beings" on a stick note that she sticks to her phone. That way, whenever the phone rings, she connects questions about the report, however trivial they may seem, to the report's ultimate purpose.
- Artist: "so she can make beautiful art that moves people."

#### Self-Talk

- A purpose is the perfect mantra.
- Self-talk boosts performance. Studies show that self-talk increases motivation and willingness to endure uncomfortable situations.
