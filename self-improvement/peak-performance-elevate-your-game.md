### The Secret to Sustainable Success

- You need to find and lift the Goldilocks weight: an amount you can barely manage, that will leave you exhausted and fatigued, but not injured, by the time you've finished your workout. Stress + rest = growth.
- 10-12 hours of sleep, diet, weekly massage and stretching sessions.
- Flow: The brightest minds spend their time either pursuing an activity with ferocious intensity, or engaging in complete restoration and recovery.
  - Immersion: Total engagement in their work.
  - Incubation: A period of rest and recovery.
  - Insight: The emergence of new ideas.
- Participants who were forced to flex their mental muscle performed worse on a subsequent task that also required mental energy as compared to participants in a control group who has an easy first task.
- **Even if their bodies are fresh, the physical performance of people who are mentally fatigued suffers.**
- Weakened self-control re: food deprivation can lead to infidelity.
- **The more we resist temptation, think deeply, or focus intensely, the better we become at doing so.** Willpower in particular is not as limited as scientists once thought, and by successfully completing smaller productive changes, we can build the strength to complete larger ones in the future.
- **Stress + rest = growth.**
- Josh Waitzkin: Chess and martial arts (tai chi) master.

### Rethinking Stress

- Lifting a heavy weight--results in a micro-tear in the muscle's tissue.
- If the stress is too much, the body fails to adapt. The muscle deteriorates. Catabolic struggle.
- The most effective tutoring systems delayed instruction until students reached the point of failure. Growth comes at the point of resistance. Skills come from struggle.
- "During training, I seek out and try to ride waves that scare me. It's only when you step outside your comfort zone that you grow. Being uncomfortable is the path to personal development and growth. It's the opposite of complacency."
- System 2 Learning: System 1 is our default, since it requires less energy, and System 2 is done by working hard and struggling to figure something out. True learning requires System 2.
  - System 1 = because we are using the connections in our brain that we have used before.
- **A little doubt and uncertainty is actually a good thing: It signals that a growth opportunity has emerged.**

### Stress Yourself

- The best violinists spent significantly more time intensely focused on mastering a specific goal, and remained totally present when doing so.
- They eliminated all distractions. They rarely just went through the motions.
- They were practicing far more "deliberately" than everyone else.
- Deep concentration. When great performers are doing serious work, their bodies and minds are 100 percent there. They are fully engaged in the moment.
- Dr. Bob: Renaissance man, he does only one thing at a time and devotes his full concentration to that one thing. The ultimate single-tasker.
- Best method for self-control: move the object of desire out of view.
- Great workers generally work in chunks of 60 to 90 minutes, separated by short breaks.
- Stress: See it as a challenge, not as something bad.
- Olympians view tournaments with determination and are not stressed that much when starting.

### The Paradox of Rest
