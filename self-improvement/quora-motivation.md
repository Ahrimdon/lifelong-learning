- "See what you can achieve by improving yourself by just 1% daily, & till what extend you can deteriorate yourself by doing the opposite: 1.01^365 = 37.8, 0.99^365 = 0.03"
- Don't be the guy that "wish they had tried."
- Suffer the pain of discipline, or suffer the pain of regret.
- Get clear on what your fire is and what energizes you.
- Create a life mantra (at least for the next month or so).
- Ask friends if they have suggestions about what your passion/strengths are.
- Write down goals and commit to them.
- Think about your purpose and your end goal.
- It is helpful to celebrate small wins.
- Commit to refreshment and recharging your batteries (hobbies, relaxation, social activities, etc.)
- Keep track of your progress. Hold yourself accountable.
- *Get started. This is often the hardest part.*
- Post visual reminders in places you think would be helpful which remind you in words or visuals of your goals & priorities.
- Get a buddy: Get someone to do it with you and/or to hold you accountable.
- Find a champion (someone who believes in you and/or your goals).
- Go on a quest to find what motivates other people in their work and life.
- *Someone once told me the definition of Hell: The last day you have on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become.*
- I don't think about it as hard work. I think about it as part of making myself into who I want to be. I want to be a hard-working person. The hard part for me is choosing and accepting what it is that I have to do. Once I've made the choice to do something, I try think about how good it must feel to be that, or how proud I might be to have done that. Make hard look easy.
- *If I fail because I lack time or talent or luck or if fate intervenes to keep me from being able to achieve a goal in the way I'd hoped, that doesn't mean I'm a failure. But if I fail because i didn't work hard enough, I'm either a half-assed quitter or lazy or stupid, none of which are what I want to be. I can only blame myself; I can't even claim I was beat or not good enough, because I didn't even try!*
- *If you wait for perfet conditions, you'll never get anything done.*
- Passion is about pushing yourself when no one else is around.
- *The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.*
- Try and fail, but don't fail to try.
- *The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do.*
- Working hard has nothing to do with your body. It is your mind and your spirit which has to grow stronger.
- If you were the person that you want to be, then what would that person do?
