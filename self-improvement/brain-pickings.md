- Brain Pickings in 2006: Plain-text email to seven friends.
- *Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind.* Just say I don't know.
- *Do nothing for prestige or status or money or approval alone.* "Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to not work on what you like, but what you'd like to like.
- *Be generous.*
- *Build pockets of stillness in your life.* Meditate. Go for walks. Ride your bike going nowhere. Unconscious processing. Sleep.
- *When people try to tell you who you are, don't believe them.* You are the only custodian of your own integrity, and the assumptions made by those that misunderstand who you are and what you stand for reveal a great deal about them and nothing about you.
- *Presence is more rewarding than productivity.*
- *Expect anything worthwhile to take a long time.*
- *Seek out what magnifies your spirit.* Who are the people, ideas, and books that magnify your spirit? Find them, hold on to them, and visit them often.
- *Don't be afraid to be an idealist.* By consistently supplying something, we can only hope to increase the demand for the substantive over the superficial.
- *Don't just resist cynicism, fight it actively.* There is nothing more difficult yet more gratifying in our society than living with sincerity and acting from a place of largehearted, constructive, rational faith in the human spirit, continually bending toward growth and betterment.
