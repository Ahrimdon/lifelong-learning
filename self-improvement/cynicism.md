- There's a difference between being occasionally sarcastic and a little derisive in your head, but then negativity becomes your default reaction, you have a problem.
- Do you:
  - Roll your eyes at "hipsters" who are just people trying to dress fashionably?
  - Primarily complain about how horrible people and things are?
  - Get angrier every time you stand in line at the grocery store, or when you're waiting for your check to arrive at a restaurant?
  - Find you're constantly frustrated with coworkers who don't "get it"?
  - Comment angrily on blogs, videos, and other web sites?
  - Feel it's okay to be a complete jerk, as long as you're "witty" about it?
- Maybe you have a snark problem.

### Cynicism and snarkiness:

- Kills productivity.
- Drains passion for your work.
- Makes you hate what you do.
- Makes you prejudicial and prone to leaping to conclusions.
- Is linked to cardiovascular illness and heart disease.
- Closes your mind to new ideas and experiences.
- Poisons your relationships.
- Erodes the foundations of democratic society.
- Is unethical.

Snark erodes our relationships and makes it difficult for us to interact with others, but it also closes our minds to people who are different than we are, shuts us off from new ideas, and redirects energy better used improving our lives and doing our jobs towards being mean to others.

Snark is ALWAYS an indicator that something else is going on in a given situation. When it's appropriate, it tells people that you're not going to let others push you around. When it's appropriate, it shows you feel the need to make yourself "bigger" than others. That need to put one's self above others can be a symptom of depression or some personality disorders. That being said, perpetually putting down others can be indicative of insecurity, narcissism, negative thought patterns, or jealousy. If those things are present, then you definitely want to address it because it's likely to affect your relationships negatively.

- Almost always, snarky, contemptuous behavior is the result of some other issue in our lives.
- The process quickly devolves into insensitivity, anger, and resentment. We start being rude for no reason, we begin we're the only competent ones around us, distrust others, reject their ideas, and we stress ourselves out over silly things.
- Are you overboard? Just ask your own friends, or think: "if I saw this in someone else, would you think they were a nice person?"
- Everyone thinks they have a reason to be judgmental, but the truth is we're all the hero of our own stories, just because you think you have a reason doesn't mean that reason is justified.
- Looking back to your posts on Twitter and Facebook are a good way to tell what's really renting space in your brain.

### What Do I Do About It?

- Enlist the help of your friends--ask them to call you out if you are being mean or unnecessarily snarky.
- Reward yourself for being nice.
- Call a mental time out.
- Give yourself an opposing script to follow when you're feeling snarky. Ex: remind yourself that not everyone has the same sense of humor as you.
- Snark is the mind-killer. Sarcasm is fun and great in small, appropriate doses, but unchecked, it alienates the people close to you, and destroys relationships.
- In the end, you wind up becoming the bad guy--that guy that things everyone else is so terrible and awful, all the while completely missing the fact that the problem isn't with them, it's with you.

## 3 Ways to Treat the Scourge of Cynicism
[Reference](https://michaelhyatt.com/the-scourge-of-cynicism.html)

- A cynic: A person who believes that only selfishness motivates human actions and who disbelieves in or minimizes selfless acts or disinterested points of view.
- Symptoms:
  - Distrust of others: Unwilling to trust anyone else. They also question other people's motives, competence, or experience.
  - Negative comments about others. The cynical person has to give expression to their distrust. They often whisper negative comments in meetings, usually under the guise of humor. It's a low risk, though cowardly way, to try and build rapport with others. No one wants to be thought naive, so people usually agree with the cynic.
  - Pessimism about the future. "Why risk belief? I might be wrong." This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- How to cure?
  - Hard cynics, they are committed to cynicism as a way of life. Take them out.
  - Soft cynics: fact-based optimism.

### Comments

- Being selfish is one of the best virtues in employees. Someone who puts them self first shows up to work healthy, rested and prepared. Someone who puts their own future first, exercises, eats well, and develops strong relationships.
- Businesses know an ideal employee is selfish, they pay employees individually. Even shared bonuses are paid to individuals.
- Selfish employees keep their work place cleaner, because it's their work place.
- Selfish salespeople make the best deals because they are concerned about future business and they work hard to maintain great relationships with their co-workers, bosses, and clients for the same reason.
- You cannot help anyone who is not willing to help themselves. A cynical person is often insecure and has to have a way to convince him or herself that they are better than others.
