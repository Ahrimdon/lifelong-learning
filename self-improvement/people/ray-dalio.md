[Reference](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/populism-phenomenon-ray-dalio/)

- Populism's role in shaping economic conditions will probably be more powerful than classic monetary and fiscal policies.
- The populist template arises from the common man being fed up with:
  - Wealth and opportunity gaps.
  - Perceived cultural threats from those with different values in the country and from outsiders.
  - Establishment elites in positions of power.
  - Government not working effectively for them.
- This is a rebellion of the common man vs the elites and the system.
- Economic policies: protectionism, nationalism, increased infrastructure building, increased military spending, greater budget deficits, capital controls.
