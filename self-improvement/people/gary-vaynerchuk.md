# My Content is a Mindset
[Reference](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/mindset/)

- At the macro level, what I am trying to express is predicated on a specific mindset.
- There are always counter-arguments to what I say.
- At its most basic form, I want to use some of these ideas and expressions to further the conversation and to allow someone to experience the personal unlock to see things differently or with a different perspective.
- Just look at the bright side and try to inspire others to have access to another mindset that I have found valuable in my own life.
- Instagram: quotes, then add articles to expand those ideas and go deeper into the details.
- Vlog, podcast, articles mean different contexts.
- The mindset: with the streams, IG posts, books, hopefully this gets through to you.
- The mindset: not looking for excuses, complaining, or deciding to give up.
