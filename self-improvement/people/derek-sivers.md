# If Youâ€™re Not All-In About a New Opportunity, Just Say No
[Reference](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/smarter-living/if-its-not-a-100-yes-its-a-no.html)

- When we dole out an easy yes instead of a difficult no, we tend to overcommit our time, energy, and finances.
- We usually tend to overestimate our own assertiveness. Saying "no" to the right things can make you earn more respect at work.

# The Time Paradox: By Philip Zimbardo and John Boyd
[Reference](https://sivers.org/book/TimeParadox)

- Financial planner: for planning an investment strategy based on your personal investment goals. How about for time?
- Future-oriented people: tend to be more successful professionally and academically, to eat well, to exercise regularly, to schedule preventative doctor's exams, but are least likely to help others in need.
- Present-oriented people: willing to help others, but less willing or able to help themselves. They're more likely to risk in risky sexual behavior, gamble, drugs, alcohol. Least likely to be successful.
- Taken as a whole, what you do on a daily basis defines who you were, who you are, and who you will become.
- Death is the end of a lifetime. Denial of death is a denial that time with end. If you imagine your life as infinite, then you are unlikely to value time as more precious than gold and are more likely to treat it as ordinary grains of sand on a beach. Denying death relieves anxiety and psychological stress, but it may also lead you to devalue life, so you may live less fully.
- When faced with routine decisions, people conserve their thought cycles and instead rely on mental heuristics (simple rules we learn through trial and error.
- Holistic present: training to live one's life in the present moment and to include past and future in an expanded state of focus on the present.
- *The Crypt of the Capuchin Monks: What you are, they once were. What they are, you will be.*
- Gratitude list: simply write a list of things for which you were grateful that day. "To be able to enjoy one's past is to live twice."
- Some present information is needed to enjoy life. Too much present orientation can rob life of happiness.
- The development of a future orientation requires stability and consistency in the present. Less educated people are more likely to live in the present. Societies that offer less opportunity for education are likely to have more citizens whose focus is limited to the present.
- Hedonistic people enjoy all things that yield pleasure and avoid things that cause pain. Beyond passive enjoyment, hedonists actively seek pleasure. They arrange their choices in life around activities that are pleasurable, arousing, stimulating, exciting, and novel.
  - Good side: good friends, lovers, and party guests. They enjoy other people as a source of stimulation, as long as the others are not boring.
  - Diverse activities, sports, hobbies. They make friends and lovers easily and frequently, and are apt to fill their lives with people whom they find stimulating and with possessions they can show off.
  - Like children, they have an open-eyed readiness to connect and an intensity that comes from being totally in the moment.
- Futures consider work a source of special pleasure. Tomorrow's anticipated gains and losses fuel today's decisions and actions.
- When you want to achieve something and you believe that you can, you work harder.
- Emotions deal with the present. Thinking prepares for the future.
- Depressed people look not to the future but to the past to relieve their depression. They feel that rehashing and rehearsing the causes of their symptoms will somehow help to solve their problems.
- A limited future encourages us to make choices that enhance our positive emotional state rather than to pursue an education or other future-oriented activity.
- *Because older people anticipate a limited future, they are more apt to do what feels good, from speaking their minds to travelling to making dramatic changes in their lives.*
- When you imagine that you have a lot of time left, you use it to learn more about the world, meet new people, and experience novelty.
- When a life's time is short, its goals become more short-term.
- Those who anticipate a short future is "quality not quantity", and they choose to spend quality time with fewer people.
- Seek knowledge about yourself and your world. Look for help doing so from a range of experts and variety of acquaintances.
- Learning to control impulses and make better choices is inextricably connected with being aware of one's internal states and with managing feelings rather than acting them out.
- We sometimes delude ourselves that we proceed in a rational manner and weigh in all of the pros and cons of various alternatives, but more often, "I decided in favor of X" is no more than "I liked X". We buy the cars we like, choose the jobs and houses we find attractive, and then justify those choices by various reasons.
- Pasts are interested in preserving money. Present fatalists: treat money as though it doesn't matter. Hedonists: money is used to create fun and excitement. Futures: time and money denote possibilities for the future.
- Couples with mismatched time perspectives are prone to miscommunication and misunderstanding.
- *Success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming. - John Wooden*
- *Identify the things in your life that make you happy, and do more of them. Identify the things in your life that make you unhappy, and do less of them.*
- The optimum time perspective:
  - High past-positive
  - Moderately high future
  - Moderately high in present-hedonistic
  - Low in past-negative
  - Low in present-fatalistic
- Depending on the demands of a situation, one time perspective must take precedence, while others may temporarily recede.
- Self-actualizing person: Tie the past and the future to the present in meaningful continuity. Not burdened by guilts, regrets, and resentments. Aspirations are tied meaningfully to present work goals.
- Amazon reviewer:
  - Past-oriented people are generally more concerned with their past and are able to distance themselves from the realities of the present or the future.
  - Traditional, religious, conservative, stable sense of self, family- and group-oriented, have a tendency to be prejudiced, rituals, try to maintain status quo, do not take risks.
  - Present-oriented: hard to give up temptations or delay gratification, concentrate on activities that bring pleasure and avoid pain, usually poor/uneducated are present-oriented because they tend to focus on emergent needs of the present, not good in abstract thinking, fun people to be around.
  - Future: goal-oriented, can work hard and avoid temptations to accomplish a goal, rehearse various future plans, health-conscious, can be unable to enjoy fun activities because those "waste time", less aggressive, more reward-dependent, less sensation seeker.

## Time paradoxes

- Time is one of the most powerful influences on our thoughts, but we are totally unaware of the effect of time in our lives.
- We can buy food, objects, space but not time.
- Each attitude toward time is associated with numerous benefits, yet in excess, each is associated with even greater costs.
- Individual attitudes toward time are learned through personal experience, yet collectively attitudes toward time influence national destinies.
