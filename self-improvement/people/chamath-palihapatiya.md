- When people scroll down, they pick the first comment that sounds good for them, and adopt that as their own opinion. People are unable to think for themselves.
- Just say "I don't know" if you don't know things. Not having an opinion about something is okay.
- Karma in Reddit plays a role in how conversations are ordered and shown.S
- Reddit vs Facebook: access to communities that share my interests via subreddits. Facebook: gratification, not community building. Ex: beekeeping is not a popular interest, but Reddit makes it possible to create a decently sized community.
- Facebook is worse than Reddit, because it consisted of friends, rather than strangers.
- Things that are consumer driven are short term in nature today.
- Like all tech, social media comes with both challenges and potential benefits.
- I think things just get hidden by down voting.
  - The problem with this is that I've seen many a legitimate opinion get down voted to hell because the hive mind of Reddit disagrees (and the hive mind is often hypocritical in its approach).
  - Because of this, I feel like there is a lot more censorship with Reddit versus FB.
- *Your Facebook experience is entirely dependent upon the circle of friends you have there.* If your friends are civil people, Facebook will seem like the most civilized place on the Internet. However, if your friends are rabid lunatics your experience will be horrid.
- Intellectual debates involve trying to understand the other persons opinion, even if your original instinct is to disagree. All Facebook does is provide a persons opinion. A more empathetic person would look to try and understand why a person has that particular opinion. Not automatically judge them for just having it. Friendships and communication aren’t about control. They’re about understanding.
- I don’t think Reddit is particularly healthy on average (for me) but at least I can do my own curation and frequent interesting subs about any topic I can think of.
  - I have had genuinely interesting discussions with interesting people on here and have learned a ton (or have been directed to other sites where I learn something interesting), and I don’t know any of you guys, which has its perks.
- *I believe that the true extent of the damage sustained by western societies is far worse than a lot of people realize because of its deep-seated and long-term nature.* The Russians have orchestrated and brilliantly pulled off a campaign of psychological manipulation against western societies and have severely damaged the EU and USA in the process. They have accomplished this by exaggerating preexisting (and in some cases very legitimate) tensions related to our multiracial and multicultural demographics, as well as by poisoning discussion of our growing financial inequalities.
- *Cambridge Analytics in 2014: Kosinski and his team tirelessly refined their models. In 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook “likes” by a user, it was possible to predict their skin colour (95% accuracy) their sexual orientation (88% accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democrat or Republican party (85%).*
  - Intelligence, religion, as well as alcohol, cigarette and drug use, could all be determined. From the data it was even possible to deduce whether deduce whether someone's parents were divorced. The strength of a model was illustrated by how well it could predict a subject's answers. Kosinski continued to work on the model incessantly: before long, his model was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook "likes". Seventy "likes" were enough to outdo what a person’s friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 "likes" what their partner knew.
- The problem isn't so much the tool, it's the fact that most people aren't taught to think critically from an early age.
  - Instead, they are taught fairy tales as fact (religion), they are taught that there's nothing more important than how you feel, or how something makes you feel, instead of how to distinguish what is factual and how to look for truth despite and sometimes at the expense of our feelings.
  - So yeah, when you build a giant web full of emotional people that lack critical thinking skills, things are bound to go south quickly.
