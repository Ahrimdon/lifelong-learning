## Benefits:
- Employers
    + Employees are more productive without in-office interruptions. The interruptions are voluntary.
    + Cut down on office space costs.
    + Exposes bad workers: It's easy to see who's not performing without the obscuring fog of in-person charisma.
- Employees
    + Judged based on results, not their input
    + Cut back on commuting time
    + People work whatever they want, from whatever part of the country they want.
    + Save gas and spend more time with family.

## Drawbacks and critiques:
- No face-to-face interaction
- Higher temptation to procrastinate
- Family members can be distracting
- Employers
    + Less frequent brainstorming
    + To the worry of employees slacking off, hire people you trust
    + Remote work might harm culture, but culture is more about values and actions rather than social activities.
    + "Corporations don't have remote work": Corporations aren't exactly bastions of efficiency.

## Tips for collaborating remotely
- Make sure employees on different time zones have about four hours of overlap in working hours.
- Use screenshtos or screencasts to communicate information.
- Share information openly on work schedules, to-do's, calendars, and files.
- Create a "virtual water cooler", a chat forum for fun and social stuff.
- Share progess with each other to fuel that sense of achievement and momentum.
- Hybrid: Some employees work at office, some at home.

## Handling common issues
- Employees: Make sure you go out and socialize, or consider working from a coworking space.
- Set up a work area according to proper ergonomics. Exercise and eat well.
- Employers: Be honest up front about your location, offer references, share progress often, respond promptly, and get the client involved.

## Hiring remote employees
- Favor real work over resumes to evaluate candidates.
- Meet top candidates in person to check for personality fit.
- Pay employees equally across geographies.

## Life of a remote worker
- Create separation between work and play with different clothes, spaces, and times.
- Experiment with different setups: working remotely only in the morning, working in public spaces, or renting a desk at a local office.
