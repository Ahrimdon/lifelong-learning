## Self Discipline: Become a Greek Spartan

- The Spartans were not the kind of people to get attached to transient and superficial little pleasures in life, least of all material possessions.
- The apex of one's accomplishment in the life of that world was to fight and defeat the enemies of Sparta through glory and gallantry in battle, and ultimately even dying on the field.

### The Spartan Way of Life

- Rigid code of conduct of both physical and moral discipline.
- There is a trend of the nurturing of weakness as if it was a virtue. The world we live in today does not necessitate that we cast away the naturally disadvantaged and afflicted.
- **This state of affairs (abundance of choice and resource) does have a bad effect, because people view self-improvement, discipline, and fitness as something that is usually necessitated and commanded by a harsh environment, and not worth the trouble in the contemporary standard of living.**
- Working on one's physical and mental prowess is not something that should be done merely to survive, but is a conscious effort undertaken by those who love and care for themselves, ultimately giving them an edge in life.
- Tough love techniques found favor among foreigners, who sought out Spartan women for their child rearing skills.
- Agoge: a place of strict regimen and military style schools where the boys would be trained as skilled warriors and marksmen. Warfare, athletics, gymnastics, and other physically demanding exercises to make them tough.
- Minimal clothes, sleep in the cold, made their own beds from grass/hay, encouraged to make do with the food in the forest.
- Final test: to kill a random, unsuspecting helot.
- Girls were trained in gymnastics, javelin, discus throws, and long distance running.
- Perfecting the art of war and violence. The respect for prowess in war was only matched by the value that the Spartans attributed to the act of bearing and raising a child into a warrior.
- There is only one career path, soldier.
- "Contest of endurance": adolescents and teens were flogged and ridiculed before an assembly.
- An overweight man or woman was regarded with loathing and disgust, and subject to much public ridicule and humiliation.
- The continual caution against too much drinking, even though wine was a staple of their diet.
- Fixed age for marriage: 30 for a man, 20 for a woman.

### Self-Discipline

- Let go of temptation: If it is your indiscriminate eating habit, do not buy junk food at all. Remove yourself from the office lunch plan.
- If it is focus and concentration you are looking for, hide your phone somewhere, and declutter your desk.
- Not having choices in life unburdens you of your freedom, yes, but it does the same with a lot of responsibility and accountability.
- When blood sugar levels are low, it has a direct impact on a person's personality and mood, as well as the ability of decision making. A hungry stomach keeps your mind churning and thinking about food all the time.
- Eat healthy snacks and meals throughout the day.
- All learned conduct can be unlearned with an adequate amount of effort. The key is not to hesitate and to just charge right into battle as you begin to wage war on your bad habits from the moment you identify them.
- Begin to identify yourself as the person you intend to be right away, and get in the mindset.
- Treat and reward yourself after each victory.
- Learn to forgive yourself--this takes time. Acknowledge being angry, frustrated, guilty, and sad at times. Acknowledge these feelings and work through them.
- *Will power is a reaction to an internal conflict.* Do you eat or do you not eat. The problem is that using your prefrontal cortex is a conscious effort. Whereas the center in charge of habitual and automatic behavior is autonomous; it is tireless and will stop at nothing to keep your habits in place.

### How to Increase Will Power

- Manage stress effectively.
- Stick to your plan. Say "I don't" instead of "I can't". "I don't want to smoke" versus "I can't stop smoking."
- Get more sleep.
- Meditation.
- Exercise and nutrition.
- Marginal procrastination.

### Transform Yourself Into an Ancient Spartan - Diet, Nutrition and Exercise

- Try eating every three to four hours.
- Make sure to include lean protein with every meal.
- Fresh and crisp greens should also be a major part of every meal.
- Being denied food while having to endure strenuous exercise and training serves a very clear and logical objective in the military. Those who prevail and overcome this ordeal will be cast in stone and ready to tackle any challenge in life and, ultimately, survive and emerge victorious in actual combat.
- Exercises
  - Wire crawl: Crawl in mud under a barbed wire.
  - Long hoop jumps.
  - Over under through. Over a wall, under a wall, then through a tire placed in the wall.
  - Spear throw/stick throw.
  - Climbing a wall.
  - Piggybacking an object.
  - Herculean Hoist.

### The Spartan Way of Life: Some Life Rules to Live By

- **Mean what you say.** You need to be diligent and dedicated to keeping them by putting in the work and the effort. Keep track of the things you said you would do and prioritize to make sure you accomplish them.
- **Deception rarely works.** If you resort to cheating, lying, and manipulating others, withholding information, you need to keep track of what you told whom, and you'll be caught one day.
- **Time matters.** In a job interview, you find yourself automatically attuned towards people who are awaiting their turn, rather than someone who saunters in late and makes you wait for them. Arriving early is just a matter of common courtesy. Practice it.
- **Beat the competition, outwork it.**
- **Act with integrity and poise.** Clear practical side to adhering to your moral compass and making the right choices in life. Being good is sometimes hard, but maintaining a steady moral course will make your life so much easier further down the road.
- **Take advantage of the information paradise.**
- **Be prudent when buying stuff.**
- **You achieve more by talking less.**
- **Change your view point.** Your life will reflect your thoughts. Not only does your thought process affect your mood and relationships, but a faulty attitude will also sometimes pose a hurdle that can virtually destroy your life and potential.
- **Every problem is an opportunity.**
- **Patience is a virtue.**
- **Every person matters.**
- **Proper nutrition.**

### The Spartan School: Lessons Learned from the Ancient Warriors.

- **Conquer your shame.** A healthy dose of shame does work to our benefit most of the time. It shields our identity from bad influences and corruption. The problem is it evolves into too much pride.
- **Embrace Hardship and Difficulties.** Entitlement. If you feel you are owed something, you won't take the steps to achieve a fulfilling life and obtain your share of happiness. There is no greater fulfillment than achieving your dreams with sweat of your own brow, and even when things don't go your way, you will always be able to take shelter in the fact that you are giving it your best shot.
- **Resist Going to Extremes.** Material objects were purely utilitarian in purpose, and once they served that, the Spartans left them alone.
- **Laugh, and be Free.**
- **What You Need to Fight For.** What is the most important thing in life? Your family and friends, of course. Pray for strength, pray for eh well-being and happiness of others, pray for humanity and fight for them.
- **Fight Your Internal Battles First.**

### How to Change Your Life for the Better

- Habits--your trip to McDonald's or Starbucks on a daily basis is not a decision, but a cultivated habit. Identify which habits need to be cut out of your life and march towards that goal.
- Would you risk a few unsteady years for a blissful existence later, or remain stuck in a horrible job and let it eat your soul away?

### Self-Awareness

- "Narrative identity." How well you understand your own life story forms the basis for your actions, both past and present, as well as your future goals.
- Reflect back on your early life experiences. What experiences had the most impact on you want which didn't?
- The deeper you delve into your backstory, the more sense a lot of your current virtues as well as flaws and inhibitions will make to you. The trick is to be completely honest with yourself and admit you have a problem even if you feel it may make you vulnerable.
- Self-reflection: keep a journal. Have a hobby in your downtime, and through this you can engage your mind in multiple ways. Creating stuff through art has been a very therapeutic and meditative effect on the vast majority of people.
- What are the times of positive and negative energy for you?
- Meaningful goals.
- Always seek honest feedback. These are the traits and quirks that we have and are unable to see in ourselves.
- False hope: do not do unethical things just because you failed somewhere.
