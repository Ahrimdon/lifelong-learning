1. Create headings for 1 year, 10 years, and lifetime, and then write down 5 to 7 goals in each category.
2. Print out two copies, sign them, frame them. Put one frame in your bedroom, one frame at work, share your one-page with a close friend.

What is the most ambitious goal you've ever set?

*Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.*

## How to Find Your Purpose

What you love doing + What you are good at + What the world needs + What you can be paid for

*Those who take the time to create their life purpose often are able to live with extraordinary energy and motivation & overcome challenges most could not dream of.*

*Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.*

*Your purpose is not something you have. Your purpose is something you create. Once you have a clear purpose and goal for your life, you can direct your life rather than letting outside factors determine your direction.*

You will be able to much more easily withstand criticism and challenges when you are internally clear on your specific purpose on this planet. The common denominator among every single highly driven and successful person I have ever met, regardless of field, is that they have committed their goals to writing and created for themselves a purpose-driven life.

*Your life is your message to the world. Make sure it is inspiring. Life is important to me. Here is what I've created as my purpose. Everything I do is driven by this sense of purpose.*

*Each of us must make the personal choice to be a hero or not, to be committed to something bigger than ourselves or not, to go beyond the way we "wound up being" and have the purpose of your lives and careers be about something that makes a difference or not, in other words, to be a leader or not.* --Werner Erhard

## Vision

"Short this life is, just one I've got, finite in tenure, whether I like it or not. Dead is embracing fear, replacing dreams with "I cannot." Alive is taking a new step, having a shot. I will do the impossible, I will change the world, I will give hope to a despairing nation, I'll give bread to a starving girl. I'll break all the records, I'll do what's never been done, I'll give and know love, I'll be a billionaire of fun."

What will you do with today, this hour, this minute? Will you fill will dull and fear or will you live it? I will not tolerate any foe no matter weapon or munition, especially if that foe is within me in the form of fear or lack of ambition. Short this life is, just one I've got. Finite in tenure whether I like it or not. As sure as the eagle I will fly, cause I choose, I choose to live until I die.

- A.E. Ballakisten

Great leaders have a clear purpose and a clear vision of the world they are working to create.

Vision boards: These are white poster boards covered with cut out images of what you want to see in your future and the world's future.

What are the instances in your life in which you've seen intention turn into reality?

Bucket lists allow you to capture your dreams. They are another way to create your future. You should update your bucket list once per year, near your birthday, or the last 5 days of the year. If you are in a relationship, try creating a bucket list of things you want to do together.

What is the most exciting thing you've done in the last year? What is the most meaningful thing you've done in the last year?

## Networks

Surround yourself only with smart, competent, and positive people. Life is too short not to. Your friends determine who you become. You should only spend time with friends who inspire you. If your friends don't inspire you, then find friends who do! Don't let chance determine who's in your life.

*It might take 5 years to completely change up the people surrounding you, but it is absolutely worth it.*

What I look for in my friends: joy, compassion, intelligence, passion, purpose. If you don't live in an intellectual center, consider a move. To avoid being mediocre, you must seek out people who are not mediocre and hang out with them.

*Only go to work for a company if you believe in the change they are trying to make in the world. Don't take a job unless you'll be working for someone of high integrity who you will learn lots from.*

To build a strong support network, create a weekly dinner roundtable of your closest 8 friends!

Inner Circle: Top 20 friends, then the names of the 10 people who inspire you most based on what they are doing with their lives, then 10 people you aren't very close with, who inspire you.

## Mentors

Who mentors you determines who you become. Who mentors you determines which networks you access. Who mentors you determines where in life you will go. The shorter your emails to busy people, the higher the chance of reply.

"Hey I'm really passionate about [...]. What do you [insert short relevant question]?

Research amazing people. Find people who are brilliant and caring, are 10-20 years ahead of you, and share a similar passion. *Find 20 potential mentors who are "you" in 15 years, and convince 2 of them that you're worth investing time into.* Ideally, get introduced to them by one of their trusted connections. Fedex them some stuff since they won't receive those messages anyway.

Pursue them repeatedly in a kind way. They will almost always respect your persistence. Explain your passion for the same thing, the "why" behind what you do, how you may be able to help them, and be 100% authentic.

*Stay at it for a few months if that is what it takes. These are people who can change your whole life, so do what it takes.* Be authentic. Be super informed. Build trust. Stay in touch every 8 weeks with quick emails. Go to the same events and develop the relationship.

## Happiness

A person can make himself happy or miserable regardless of what is happening outside just by changing the contents of conciousness.  -- Mihali Csikszentmihali

The ability to persevere despite obstacles & setbacks is the most important trait for succeeding in life. -- Mihali Csikszentmihali

The hotter the temperature the iron is forged in, the stronger the steel. So don't be afraid of a struggle: often the greatest individuals are those who have been through the most.

- True happiness occurs when your inhibitions of revealing your true self are extinct.
- True happiness occurs when you can fully express yourself & bring your full passion into your daily work.
- True happiness occurs when your daily work is actually the greatest contribution you can make to humanity with the gifts you have.
- True happiness occurs when you are making a difference in the lives of others.

*Living with joyfulness and ease is a choice that you can make.*

## Health

The food we eat literally becomes us as nutrients are absorbed and used.

A combination of high calorie & high salt diet, with little physical activity greatly decreases the ability of the body to cure itself from cancerous cells.

*78% of cancer is caused by tobacco, diet, sunlight, and alcohol.*

At least every 3 months, do a complete digital detox, with no phones/laptops for at least 72 hours.

## Meditation

Breathing properly is important for meditation. Art of living happiness program, Isha foundation inner engineering course.

Art of living silence (being completely silent) helps.

## Habits

"Your beliefs become your thoughts, Your thoughts become your words, Your words become your actions, Your actions become your habits, Your habits become your values, Your values become your destiny." -- Mahatma Gandhi

What you do repeatedly creates your life and your results. There is great power in hacking your habits. If you're not getting the results you want in life, adjust your habits.

## Communication

- When you talk to people, look them in the eye.
- When you greet people, bound up to them with energy and excitement.
- When you talk to people, smile.
- When you talk to people, be joyous, not stressed.
- Always let your passion shine through.
- Restate the other person's point before you add your own.
- Never start a sentence with BUT.
- Avoid saying the words "um" and "uh".
- Any time you have something difficult to communicate, do it in person.
- Avoid sending emails with more than 5 sentences.

## Money

The rich have their assets work for them. They have gained control over their expenses by focusing on acquiring and building assets. Their businesses pay more of their expenses, and they have few, if any, personal liabilities.

Money is simply a store of value which enables two parties to exchange, even if they cannot barter.

*Including all your savings, investments, and debt, what is your net worth right now?*

1. Spend less money than you earn every month.
2. Never go into debt for something that you do not need.
3. Save early in life, as the law of compound interest helps a lot over time.

After building up 3 months of salary in your savings account, start investing. Start investing $1000 per month as early as you can in life.

To become a millionaire, either build a business or save & invest wisely for 30 years.

18 years from now, your financial situation will be a function of the plan you put in place and the actions you take today.

## Investing (Skipped)

## Love

Laughter, optimism, vibrant energy

Before you can find someone else to fall in love with you, you must love yourself first. Because to find an amazing partner, you yourself must first be amazing.

To find a partner who is following their dreams, you must first be following your dreams. To find a partner who is living passionately, you yourself must first be living passionately.

Don't lead your partner on. Follow the golden rule in all relationships. Be playful and let the little kid inside out. Push your partner to get better and become the best version of themselves.

## Values

To be human is to have the ability to transcend our egocentric preconditioning and care so deeply for our children, partners, friends or even strangers that we would put their interest above our own no matter what it might cost us personally" - Ray Kurzweil
