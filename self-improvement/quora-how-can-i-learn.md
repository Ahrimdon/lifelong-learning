Seven step process:

1. Learn to be more observant
2. Learn to find everything interesting
3. Learn to question everything
4. Travel
5. Talk to people
6. Read
7. Create projects

Sherlock embodies the first three steps. Holmes trained himself to develop the habit of being observant. We tend to train ourselves to do the opposite - to block things out. But Sherlock pushed through that and started to notice details. To prevent that becoming tiring or boring he trained himself to find those details interesting. 

Anything can be interesting if we show interest in it. That was an epiphany that hit me one day in college. I was in a class that I found boring. *And then I realized that the subject can't be boring - because if it was, the professor would not have chosen to devote his life to it.* I was the one making it boring. That realization was a wake up call and I became intrigued to learn why the professor found the subject fascinating.

Once Sherlock taught himself to notice details and then to find them interesting, he became curious about the why, what, how, when, and where of those details. What job would cause that particular pattern of wear on the cuffs of a sleeve? Where would one find the orange mud on the hem of those pants? He then had concrete, not abstract, problems to solve.

Travel works wonderfully - it exposes us to new details and details that contrast with our prior experiences. Why do the winemakers in Santorini shape their vines into baskets, close to the ground? That's different than I've observed elsewhere.

Talking to people works wonderfully. It is the most difficult one for me. Reading opens up worlds to us. It's one of my greatest joys. 

Creating projects is a good way to require yourself to learn. In college I had a friend that was really into cars. I didn't understand half of the things he said. I felt ignorant. So I created the conditions where I would have to learn about cars. I gave my functioning car to my sister and bought a non-functioning 1966 Volvo Amazon that had spent a decade rusting in the woods and had two bullet holes from the previous owner, whom was currently in Stark prison. I had to walk to and from school until I learned enough about cars to restore that Volvo.

This mistake I made for years was to passively acquire information, mostly through reading. 

Computer programming made me realize that's suboptimal. What's great about programming is that results matter. If a program doesn't run, it doesn't run, and you only have yourself to blame. Or if it only runs after hours of debugging, you know all those bugs were created by you. In many other endeavors, it's possible to blame others. In programming—at least solo programming—you can't. Which means that if you try to learn programming using multiple learning techniques, you quickly see which work and what doesn't.

What didn't work for me was to learn a programming language by reading many books about it. That is important, and I still do it, but it's not enough. For years, this astounded me. I would read five books about C++, understand everything I read, sit down a computer, and be unable to program. Even with all that information crammed into my head, it kind of felt like I was starting from scratch. I only really learned it after hours of practice. 

*People want shortcuts, but they don't exist. Our brains are rigged to learn by repetition (mostly related motor and social skills) and trial-and-error. You must go through the process of trying, failing, and trying again (and failing again, etc.). Failure is so important to learning, I keep a "failure diary" and have published parts of it online. I can't stress enough how much this has helped me.*

How can you learn a non-practical subject? What if you're studying History or Literary Theory, instead of something like programming or auto-mechanics? You can't simply write a History program, run it, and see if it works.

The key, I've found, is to socialize it. Explain what you've learned to someone else. You can do this in casual conversation (if your friends are interested), through teaching (if you have the opportunity), or through writing (e.g. on Quora). 

Explaining what I've learned is so vital to me, I don't assume I understand something until I've explained it to several people and they've clearly understood. And, time and again, I've discovered that when I skip that process, I don't really understand what I think I understand.

Take every opportunity offered to do something you've never done before. Feel free to fail. Learn to love to study, to prepare, to accept constructive criticism. Keep trying. And when you're in between projects brush up something you know but aren't working on currently. You are on the Internet - the greatest self-education resource in the world. Use it.

# Jeff Meyerson, Host of The Quoracast 

One component is the act of putting your head down and solving a problem on your own, with a clear goal in mind. In my experience, people that set almost unreachable expectations for themselves end up learning the most.

The other component is to learn is by conversing and solving problems with people who can communicate effectively. In order to gain access to those people you have to solve some problems on your own, in order to prove your merit. This can be a frustrating process, but as soon as you are in their position you will realize that you need a way to filter away flaky or unqualified people before starting to rely on them.

Also, don't take the 10,000 hours rule as a dictum. Narrow expertise is nice, but 2,500 hours in four different disciplines is just as useful and unique an experience if you are capable of synthesizing knowledge from different domains.

# Why do we get frustrated when learning something?

# Marcus Geduld, 35 years of study in psychology

School trains us to get frustrated when we fail. 

Failure is a very good thing. It's one of the best—maybe the best—learning devices. Yet rather than capitalize on it, most schools work hard to turn failure into something distasteful. And by the time people graduate, having spent most of their formative years in an institution where failure is a sin, they have a huge aversion to failing.

In most schools, the major structural element is ranking. We're wired to take ranking seriously. As soon as ranking exists, we care about it. A, B, C, D, F. Pass/Fail. And in the worst-case-scenario, you fail and are "kept back a grade," which affects you socially. 

I have many memories of teachers compounding the problem. The didn't say, "How interesting: you got an F. Let's examine the situation and see how that happened..." Instead, Fs came with stern lectures. When we got Fs, teachers (and parents) were very disappointed in us. 

They didn't tell us that failure was a natural part of the learning process. They told us we had let them and ourselves down. We were basically told, over and over, for years, that if we got Fs, it was because we were lazy or stupid. Laziness is a moral failing; stupidity is an innate deficit. Failure—school tells us—means we're moral and physical cripples.

People (understandably) hate this so much, that as soon as they can, they put themselves in a position where they never have to fail again. (Or where the chances of failing are as small as possible.) They find jobs that aren't all that challenging after an initial learning curve. The goal, conscious or not, is to coast for the rest of one's life.

Which gives adults very little day-to-day experience with failure. Most people I know failed at certain subjects in school (maybe not by getting Fs, but by struggling with those subjects for years), and now have simply decided "I'm not a x person" or "I just don't get x", e.g. "I'm not a Math person" or "I just don't get Shakespeare." That absolves them from trying. Which keeps them from failing. Which keeps them from learning. 

This is not the way we start out. If infants decided, after many hundreds of failures, "I'm just not a walking person" or "I just don't get talking," we'd all be screwed. Luckily, those skills are acquired before school gets its clutches on us.

This reminds me about game design, and how we deal with failure in games. It's a very delicate balance, you make it too easy, most player will get bored and lost interests; you make it too hard, most players will get frustrated and stop playing. The key is to make sure player knows it's possible to win. I think the frustration doesn't come from failure alone, it also comes from the feeling of helplessness and hopelessness, from not knowing what exactly you did wrong, or knowing no matter what you do, there's no way to get it right. Combine these two, you get a lot of controllers throwing and internet raging. 

If the game is hard, but the tutorial is good, the progression curve is good, and there's always a way to win, all you need is practice, observe, and more practice, then the game could be challenging and fun. (Ninja Gaiden, Dark Souls). But it worth noticing these games are niche games. I personally don't like this kind of formula, I don't get that much satisfaction in beating a particularly hard boss. 

Back to the topic at hand, I don't think it's just the school (although it plays very crucial part), I think as human being, we don't like to fail in general. Even in games, which is designed to be fun, we want challenge and we want to win. And we don't like to fail, even the stake is relatively insignificant.

I agree. Failure tends to lead to two main emotions: anger and curiosity. I suspect there's a genetic component to how much of one or the other a given person tends to feel.

What institutions can do is to create environments that tilt people towards one or the other: schools tend to tilt towards anger. Institutions can also work to mitigate the negative feelings associated with failure.

If one has a strong need for something and the process one is attempting is just a tactic to fulfill that need, naturally failure stings. If we fail, we don't achieve our goal. We don't get the food or the job or the girl or the attention...

So another way institutions can help is by not creating those sorts of goals. If the goal is To Get An A or To Graduate, then learning isn't the goal. Learning is a tactic used to get an A or graduate. Naturally, students will feel frustrated when they fail. Failure will mean that they haven't obtained their goal.

In a school, the goal should be 100% about the learning process, not the grade at the end. And failure should be a built in, expected part of that process. Students should learn that if they're not failing, they're doing it wrong. I am quite serious when I say that students should be rewarded for failing.

The worst fear is "What if I never obtain my goal? What if I keep failing and failing?" Institutions can (but generally don't) help. They don't but could say, "Well, first of all there are many paths to success. If plan A fails, let's try to formulate plan B." In the worst case scenario of total, permanent failure, an institution can help students learn how to cope. That's a vital life skill.

Impatience.

Our minds create an expectation, sometimes unrealistically to the point of "wishful thinking."

Reality exists in the execution.

There is an inevitable gap between the two, when reality falls short of expectation.*

The bigger the gap, the bigger the frustration.

Lessening the expectation or improving the execution are the only two ways I know of to minimize the gap, and the related frustration that comes with it.

You're frustrated? That might be a good thing. Others have suggested that we get frustrated when learning, because our social institutions have trained us to become overly-anxious about how well we are learning compared to others. I do want to suggest that our institutions aren’t operating entirely on a blank slate here. They are amplifying a natural tendency toward frustration in learning. And that natural tendency sometimes serves a good purpose.

1. What situations trigger frustration (in learning)?

It seems to me that we tend to get frustrated in learning when 1) we have a goal (comprehending or using some concept or technique in a reasonable amount of time), and 2) we are having trouble reaching the goal.

More generally, it seems, we get frustrated when we come up against unexpected complications that show us that our goal will be more difficult to reach than we thought, or it will take more time to reach than we thought.

2. What actions does frustration motivate?

When we get frustrated, we tend to stop working and stew in our juices for a bit. 

As we sit there stewing we do try to think of solutions to our problem (which is the obviously useful thing to do). But we usually do more than this. We also tend to spend a lot of time and energy worrying about what the unexpected complication “MEANS”.

It's this kind of thinking that makes frustration seem perverse. But, then again, maybe this second-guessing serves a larger purpose.  

3. What's the purpose of frustration?

We each have a psychological need for competence. We want to feel like we are valued members of our tribe – essential cogs with skills that can’t be easily replaced.

And there are very many niches to fill in modern society – very many ways to demonstrate competence.

Frustration gives us a chance to ask ourselves important questions about the value of our learning project.

Sometimes we will get frustrated, will brood a bit, and will decide that there are better uses of our time. Often there are.

And sometimes we will get frustrated, will brood, and will decide that we really love the field, and have evidence that we are well suited for it. This will renew our strength, and we will tackle the hurdle with vigor.

This is one reason frustration is especially crippling at early stages of learning a field, and less so later on. Later on we have more evidence (from experience) that we can clear the hurdles.

On this picture, then, frustration is a way of forcing us to consider the opportunity costs of persisting in a learning project that might not be a good fit for our natural talents.

In giving this explanation I am not saying that we shouldn't push through frustration. I’m not saying that society doesn't amplify frustration, and perhaps to an unhealthy degree. Because modern society is so efficient at replacing cogs with other cogs, and because so many people are in the same labor market, the modern world very much amplifies our anxiety when we become frustrated.

I’m not even saying that we shouldn't learn things that we lack a natural gift for if we’re really curious about them. But, we each have limited time, and an almost unlimited number of things we can learn.

If we want to find a niche that we can become relatively good at, then frustration can be a force that guides us into making the best use of our time (provided we listen to good advice, and are, at the end of the day willing to work hard and push through difficulties when the evidence suggests that it will ultimately pay off.)
