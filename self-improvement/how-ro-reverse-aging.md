- 2x in the group given responsibility for taking care of a plant were still alive as in the other group.
- The mind and the body are not separate.

#### Counterclockwise

- 1981: 8 men would go into a building and they should act as if they were 22 years younger, and that they can't discuss things that happened after 1959.
- *Goal: To trigger their bodies mentally to exhibit the energy and biological responses of much younger persons.*
- After 5 days, improvement in: hearing, eyesight, memory, dexterity, and appetite. No more canes.
- By expecting these men to function independently, and by engaging with them as individuals, not as old people, Langer gave these men "an opportunity to see themselves differently".

#### The roles you play in life determine your identity and behavior

- Ex: Stanford Prison Experiment.
- We are all playing roles on different stages in varied contexts.
- In one situation, you may play the role of a musician, in other roles you may play a parent, a friend, a lover, a student, or a teacher.
- People get to choose their stage, who they will be, and how they will act. They have not yet decided to write the story of their own lives, but instead have consigned the storytelling to someone or something outside of them.
- If your current context requires something different, dismiss who you've been in the past. Allow yourself to evolve. Quit putting yourself in a box.

#### The Process

- Determine your goal.
- *Commit to your goal by leaping into situations that require you to live up to your goal.*
- Determine the roles you will need to play in the various situations you create.
- *Act the part until you become the part.*
- Develop relationships with people who have your back and can help you achieve your goals.

- *When you decide what you want, you set the stage. You get to create the plot, the setting, and the characters that will be in your story. Most importantly, you get to decide which characters you will play, and how your story will unfold.*
- Every next level of your life will demand a different you.
- As you grow, your perspective and abilities also expand.

“Social psychologists argue that who we are at any one time depends mostly on the context in which we find ourselves. But who creates the context? The more mindful we are, the more we can create the contexts we are in. When we create the context, we are more likely to be authentic. Mindfulness lets us see things in a new light and believe in the possibility of change.”―Ellen Langer

- *Rather than changing their environment, they strive to overcome their current environment. This is the essence of willpower, our individualistic Western culture's obsession.*
- When you commit to an enormous goal that exceeds your current capability, willpower won't solve your problem. You'll need a new environment that organically generates your goals, a context that forces you to become more than you currently are.
- Willpower is for people who haven't made up their minds. *Commitment on the other hand is a point of no return.*

#### What role do your environments require you to be?

- In every human interaction you're in, you are performing.
- How do you want to influence those around you?
- Who do you need to be to achieve your goals?
- What will your voice be?

- *Authenticity involves deciding who you will be and the character you will play.*
- Your most authentic self is who you intend to become. When you change a single area of your life, the whole transforms with new and distinct characteristics from the sum of its parts.

#### Act as If

- You can develop to mastery nearly every quality and ability.
- Act as if you are already that person (coder, musician, leader, etc.)
- Impostor syndrome! But overtime, you will adapt to your environment. Acting as if will become acting as is.

#### Developing Important Relationships

- The real path to success in work and life is through creating an inner circle of “lifeline relationships.” These are deep, close relationships with a few trusted individuals who will offer the encouragement, feedback, and generous mutual support you need to reach your full potential.
- These “lifeline relationships” are the people who make sure you don’t give up and quit. Without these people, you will fail. The situations you’ll put yourself in will be too much for you to handle alone.
