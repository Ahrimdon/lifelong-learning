## You Are Not "Behind"
[Reference](http://zackkanter.com/2016/01/13/you-are-not-behind/)

- Being behind: compared to what? Some alternate reality version of yourself?
- There is no other version of yourself, there is only the version sitting here right now. You are not behind, you are exactly where you are supposed to be. So take a deep breath and relax.
- If you binged watched, or didn't exercise, those are neither good nor bad. They are irrelevant and you need to let go of them if you want to move forward and be happy.
- No more wasting time thinking about all of the things you have or have not done.
- *It may be worth looking at your history in order to learn more about yourself, but that learning stops when review turns to regret. Regret is just a horrible attempt at time travel that ends with you feeling like crap.*
- *You can't do anything in the past. So turn your eyes forward and focus on what you can change: the future.*
- The further behind you start, the more glorious your comeback would be anyway.
