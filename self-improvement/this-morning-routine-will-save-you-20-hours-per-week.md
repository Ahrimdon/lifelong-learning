- Most people's work is a blend of low-velocity work mixed with continual distraction.
- When you are results-oriented, you're 100% on what you're working and 100% off when you're not.
- Intensive activity followed by high quality rest and recovery.
- 1-3 hours intensive, "deep work" with no distractions.
- Your best work might actually happen while you're away from work, recovering.
- 20% of energy on your work and 80% of energy on recovery and self-improvement. When you're getting high quality recovery, you're growing. When you're continually honing your mental model, the quality and impact of your work continually increases (deliberate practice).
- Only 16% of respondents reported getting creative insight while at work.
- While doing something else, the external stimuli prompts memories and other thoughts.
- Creativity, after all, is making connections between different parts of the brain.
- Immediately following sleep, your mind is most readily active to do thoughtful work.
- On a different level, the science of willpower and self-control are strongest immediately following sleep.
- Recommendation is: 30g/protein 30 minutes after awaking.
- Journaling: Writing down what I will do for today, or anything.
- Workouts became more productive when they did it not immediately following sleep.
- After the workout, a great mental break, you can work a few more hours again.
- Meetings should be done in the afternoons. Protect your mornings since that is when you are most productive.
- Regular exercise slows down brain aging by as much as 10 years.
- You are a system, if you change a part of any system, you change the whole. Improve one area of your life, and all other areas improve in a virtuous cycle.
- The types of foods you eat and when you eat them determine your ability to focus at work. Same with your ability to sleep well.

### Don't Forget to Psychologically Detach and Play

- Completely refraining from work-related activities and thoughts.
- This leads to less work-related fatigue/procrastination, engagement at work, greater work life balance, greater marital satisfaction, and greater mental health.

Benefits of play:

- Memory, learning skills, problem solving, math skills, self-regulation skills.
- Cooperation, team work, conflict resolution, leadership skills, control of impulses and aggressive behavior.
