Lecture 1
Road to PP
humanistic psych was a reaction to psychoanalysis and behaviorism
problem was that it lacked rigorous methodology
positive - we take humanistic, and bring rigor to it
grandparents - maslow (behaviorism) and horney (psychoanalysis)
parents - seligman, langer
structure of our brain actually changes until the day we die
it changes when you meditate
information is not enough. 
education quest for information and transformation, and therefore must begin with a question.
education creates people who are always looking for answers and such
people who are successful are driven, and were driven  well.
they always asked questions. always read more.
Eastern psych has discussed positive psych for 1000s of years
in the ideal college there would be no degrees, no grades -maslow
final project is a lecture - teaching other people
 
Lecture 2
Why Positive Psych
Think always what to do if one year left
Life satisfaction = many studies
psychology has always focused on the negative
they said that its focused on negative because its what happens anyway
more people are depressed nowadays
we have to prevent through cultivating the positive
getting rid of depression is not enough to be happy
1. psychology should react and create
2. focus on positive awa negative
3. we can cultivate the negative to positive before getting to 0
positive - illness is the absent of health
negative - health is the absence of illness
neurosis - the failure of personal growth
social support is very important - not just our misery but also our wonders
men benefit from marriage more than women do
resilience - from social support, optimisim, a sense of meaning, prosocial behavior, focusing on strengths, set goals - these are what people in university/inner-city have or do to succeed
another char was a rolemodel
stop blaming others and just rely on yourself to succeed!
we want to spread goodness, as politicians, as teachers, etc
marva collins - her book is the best in taking responsibility for your own actions
FOCUS ALWAYS ON YOUR STRENGTHS.
 
lecture 3 basic premises

education - building on a spiral as you move along
happiness is ultimately determined by the internal 
Schools of thought
* bridge building vs division and serparation
* change is possible vs change is illusive
* internal factors determine happiness vs external circumstances
* human nature must be obeyed vs human nature is perfected
* pursuit of happiness is good or pursuit of happiness is narcissistic
ivory tower vs main street - very few people are actually able to talk and learn about optimizing happiness
celibacy does not suit universities - they must share their knowledge and actions
stereotype - misconception is that we dont evaluate our selves adequately
most people actually contribute to charity
stereotype - americans give by far more than any other people in the world. americans are actually generous, even if you control for wealth. americans volunteer 4 hours a week, more than any other in the world
with the unteachables, you have to communicate to them to believe in themselves
honestly EVERYBODY can become something with enough positive feedback but not everyone is given the feedback they need
psychology helps in conflict resolution, wars, etc
it is our responsibility with this education to take the ideas and apply them
some say that some people are predisposed to be happier - and it is true!
but most of the difference is up for grabs
minnesota twin studies - they checked twins who have the same genes but were bought up in different circumstances or countries
the experiment showed taht there was no significant difference in the sample in terms of happiness levels
"it may be that trying to change your happiness does not even work and might cause frustration anyway"
there is evidence that a single sentence has changed someone's life
it turns out that the experiment saying that people don't change was wrong because it was based on the average. on the average, people dont change, but it is possible to change one's happiness and people have definitely done that
the problem with this study is that its really cruel and that it becomes a self-fulfillng prophecy
maslow said that we should most definitely study the farthest and the best that humans have been in order for us to optimize how we work
example - study the people who succeed despite the negative circumstances
always study the best in order to know what to do
one ofthe best studies of all time - the cambridge-somerville youth study - studied 250 kids in inner-city were given the best psychiatric attention and academic training. there were also 250 other random kids
5-year intervention then a 40-year follow-up
what happened was that 1/3 (both control and experimental) had an official criminal record. additional 20% had unofficial. 10% serious offense. no difference on health, mortality, well-being and other psych characteristics DESPITE the intervention.
there was a significant difference in alcoholism and job status - they were more terrible
obviously the psychology field was startled! it seemed that an intervention was more harmful
individuals definitely can make a difference but the problem is that there are not enough people who pour the resources in
the activity might have failed because the children became spoiled, unlike collins's tough love
never underestimate the power of human networks. ideas spread real fast
fold a paper 41 times and you'll reach the moon
we fail to see the effect of exponential change!


 
LECTURE 4 - Basic Premises

better to study outliers and apply to us than to study the average
they studied the best relationships and they came up with prescriptions as what makes a great relationship
meditation - you go to tibet and study people who have meditated for 20 years etc
a study that gave the students the best psychologists/teachers failed horrendously. kids got lower grades because they were entitled and they didn't get to know hard work
praise alone will not work. we need praise and forcing hard work.
psych is not about giving good news. its about giving honest news
Internal factors determine happiness vs external circumstances
professors working on tenure, regardless of whether they got it or not, their base level of happiness went to the base level before they got the tenure etc
income matters VERY little because we adapt
external circumstances matter very little to happiness
we have to see what we can focus and cultivate about myself
focus on stuff that give me meaning, and give me pleasure in my life
since we return to the base level at some point, we have to find a way to increase the base level
human nature must be obeyed vs human nature is perfected
This question is central to the history of political thought, psychological thought, to the history of philosophy. Is our nature fixed or can we change or modify them.
You can divide political thinkers into 2 realms - constrained -> human nature is fixed and unconstrained  ->we need to improve it
Constrained - human nature immutable, flaws inevitable, acceptance, channel nature - adam smith, ayn rand, francis bacon
Unconstrained - hn can be improved, perfectible, solutions exist, change nature
Usually people on the constrained side will be the capitalists
One - lets use nature, the other = let's find our nature
Prof feels that the healthy side psychology wise is in the constrained part
We have to accept parts of our nature as a human
It is about unconditional acceptance of our nature about certain things. Even if I experience jealousy and envy towards my best friends. Is it an emotion that I like? No. But is it an emotion that I have experienced it? Yes. I can either perfect my nature or I can say, well, its a part of who i am and who i am as a human. Feeling depressed and down? Its part of being human
It's not a sign of resignation. It's a sign of having a choice. Though I hate it, I have to do it. Permission to be human. I still do it.
A problem is that we don't let others the feeling of being a human. We don't let people express their feelings even if they are not feeling good. "I'm feeling great!" It's the norm now.
The problem too is when you say that you feel down, everybody says "I feel great!"
Always give yourself the permission to be human.
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.

Pursuit of happiness is good or pursuit of happiness is narcissistic
Is it?
We should work to cultivate positive emotions in ourselves not just as end states, but also as a means to achieving psychological growth and improved psychological and physical health over time.
People feeling good had an easier time thinking and were more creative 
Lecture 5 - Beliefs and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
There is some study about the correlation of happiness to money but not that much. It matters only to people in poverty
We are motivated by statuses and prestige and so on and once we know this, our motivation changes from the money and the external to the internal
The intrinsic motivators make people work harder than the extrinsic ones
There's some study that says that optimistic people were delusional and pessimistic people were realistic.
Be tied to reality. Not to what is happening now, but to get tied to reality on a long timeline. Example - Marva Collins - she doesn't look at the child in front of her, but at the potential of the child. Marva Collins is realistic, more realistic than a teacher who evaluates a child in front of her.
Advice to new parents - Over the next few months, you will experience every type of emotion. To the extreme. Most helpful advice ever. Why? Because from having the attention of 1-1 of husband and wife, the child will be a "competing" party.
Tal experienced envy to the bady because of this and yet he experienced ecstacy because of love to the baby. It's normal.
We need to experience the negative emotions in order to facilitate the positive emotions. We also need ourselves to be human to experience the positive emotions especially in a world where we are cynical about positive emotions.
Sometimes we dont give ourselves the permission to be happy because of guilt of other peoples suffering and poverty and misery
Happiness can be shared. Happiness does not necessarily be a zero-sum game. It's not.
There are outliers. There are depressed people who are creative. There are happy people who aren't.
What got Tal into psych - runner Roger Bannister
There was a belief before that people cannot run a mile in 4 minutes. Doctors said that physiologically, we can't break the 4-minute barrier. Robert trained and trained until he was able to do so. He was able to beat it at some point. And then after, people started to break it too.
Buddha - all that we are are our thoughts, and with our thoughts we create our world.
Pygmalion - tried to create the perfect woman. it was impossible
Study made in where students were tested, and testers told the teachers who were going to be fast spurters. These were actually chosen randomly. Teachers were told not to tell the students that they were fast spurters.
The fast spurters performed better not only in humanities but in objective tests such as math. The IQ of the fast spurters increased significantly.
Communicating more belief actually increases people's ability in themselves.
Milgram's experiment
Zimbardo's prison experiment
Langer 1979 expriment - changing thought patterns to the elderly increased different signs - physical, mental, etc. even appearance and muscle strength increased. its about the power of the mind
Even eyesight! Just because of positive thinking.
Priming has a very big effect on us. Hence we have to prime ourselves to the better.
Environment is important. Even in the subconscious level. It influences our mood, our demeanor, our intelligence. How we think, how we persist.
Work environment - fill it with pictures of your family, what drives you, quotes to live by, your goals. Prime yourself.
Have great hopes for yourself. 
If your mind can conceive the four-minute mile, it is more likely that you will be able to do it.
Albert Bandura - Stanford positive psych prof. He bought the scientific rigour to the fun of the self-help movement.
The level of self-esteem has a huge effect on how we deal with people, basically anything.
People with low self-esteem don't give themselves the privilege of being happy. There is no correlation between the external circumstances and happiness. There is a high correlation between self-esteem and happiness.
 
Lecture 6
Question brought up was - how about the environment in Harvard.
People in Harvard are there because they work hard and are perfectionists
Meditation - Is all about repriming the mind about stuff. Same with exercise. Same with music.
Placebo effect - an effect of the power of the mind
A group of women who were vomitting were given medicine to make you vomit more. They were told that this will make them better. It made them better.
Obviously feeding someone cyanide would kill them but the point is that the mind has a say on these types of things
Aside from the encouragement, we have a mind's consistency. We have mental schemas about things. If I drop something, then it falls. I believe this person is... I believe...
There is also the outside world. Independent of my schema, this is how things happen.
Sometimes people want confirming evidence for my schema because I dont want my schema to be wrong.
Example is the runners - they created a reality in which they were thinking that something impossible was possible
You are always going to create and justify facts and whatever to make agree with your views.
BELIEFS -> JUSTIFICATIONS - > PERFORMANCE -> INTERPRETATION
Edison believed that things were possible before they actually happened.
Most number of home-runs -> usually also has the most number of strikeouts
If you don't learn to fail then you will fail to learn
Seligman - pessimists were realists about present and long-term goals. optimists were unrealistic in the shortterm, but were realists in the long term.
Optimists raise reality to  match their beliefs. After many failures, they raise their level of performances to match their beliefs.
Try stuff!
You also have to have the right sense of realism. Prisoners of war - "it's hard, but we'll make it". Combine the right dose of belief with the right dose of realism. Positive beliefs are not enough.
 
Secret of success
OPTIMISM. PASSION. HARD WORK. No successful person in history did not have these three skills. The passion, the vision, and the willingness to work hard and do what is needed to do. Thomas Jefferson - The harder I work, the luckier I get.
Why doesn't every teacher behave like Marva Collins? Some because they want to protect the child. High expectations oftentimes lead to disappointment. They don't want their child to be disappointed. They don't want their child to have low self-esteem. Example: William James.
James -> Self-esteem = SUCCESS/PRETENSIONS
William James was WRONG. We have to cope. We have to try things. Over time we get to have a knowledge of the world and how to be better. Since we see ourselves and we update our mental schema about ourselves, we feel better about ourselves. Over time, there will be ups and downs. But overall, our lives would be better.
The pain associated with the pain of failure is much greater than the pain of actual failure because ultimately we go back to our base level of happiness. 
Lecture 7 - Failure
Question - if we like to party, why don't we party more?
"I care too much about my academic success", "I'm don't have time here"
Everyone compares himself to others. We have to shift our focus to "how can I improve myself." Weaken the comparing inclination and strengthen the self-improvement inclination
Oftentimes we have just one thing that we do. Distribute yourself onto a few things to have several things to like about yourself
Coping - getting out of the comfort zone. Taking risks. Having high expectations and giving it. Coping in many ways is about having courage. Courage is about having fear and going ahead anyway.
Hard work/coping -> Success -> Self-efficacy -> Hard work/coping
Let's not look for failure, but when failure does come, interpret it as "okay, it has happened, let me embrace it and move on."
Kierkegaard - "To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose one's self.
Tal said that it's hard for him to speak in front of crowds but he knew that he wanted to influence the world through education. It's hard but he had to do it. So he thought of himself being successful already.
Best advice about lecturing - Prepare prepare prepare and then be spontaneous.
"I usually take three weeks to prepare for an extemporaneous speech" - Mark Twain
The subconscious mind does not differentiate between real things and unreal things. If I imagine success repeatedly, and put the positive schema successfully, over time the mind will look for consistency and I will perform as well as I have imagined.
The mind will not discriminate between "giving a talk" and "imagining giving a talk."
Focus on the destination as well as the journey. Focus on the race as well as the finishing line.
Listen to "I have a dream speech". It discusses the vision as well as the steps to remove racism in the country.
Involve different senses. Example again is the I have a dream speech. It involves sounds and hearing and feeling things.
Cognitive therapy - Thoughts drive actions. Event -> evaluation -> emotion
If we want to change our emotion, what we need to do is not focus on the event, but in the evaluation. Change it. Many of the thoughts that lead to the event leads to the irrational feelings about it. Accept that negative emotions are natural (be human) but know that evaluations about things can be IRRATIONAL.
If you had an "I failed here" don't make it "I'll never be able to do this."
All or nothing thinking - thinking in absolutes. "An almost perfect performance is no good."
Get rid of mental filters which distract you from thinking clearly. When you think of negative thoughts, think "does this make sense?"
Literally everything you do is a choice. Don't make it "I must do this" but make it "I want to do this."
Study conducted on "who are the happiest people" found that there were the same bouts of negative emotions with the happiest and the saddest people. The happiest people got over quicker than the saddest ones. They had different cognitive emotions of the events.
Babies seem happier because they cry more. They have a negative emotion, they let it out.
Changing interpretations about events takes time. Do it and do it and do it again to get used to it.
Are we born optimists or pessimists? Yes there is an innate component but it's a range.
The way that people view the world is better than objective things.
What you focus on becomes reality. Focus only on what matters. We see what we look for and we miss much of what we look for but are there.
The mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. Look up in the sky and see the miracle.
 
Lecture 8 - Optimism
Many in Harvard have exited the comfort zone, and shouldn't that make them happier? Since you are out of your comfort zone, think what can I do to increase my self-esteem? We have experiences that we don't use to increase our SE. Sometimes truth is already there but we don't process it as truth. Think "what can I learn here?"
When we exit our CZ we have to do it for the right reasons. Really believe in what you are doing. "What do I really, really want to do with my life?"
There's an optimum to being in or out of the comfort zone, per person. There are people who are risk takers and people who are not. Identify the right amount of discomfort for you.
Is it possible to cultivate faith? How does one cultivate faith as a science?
In a world where people don't believe in God, what happens daw is nihilism and depression. To alleviate we have to find a way of giving meaning in our lives. God is easier, but ultimately we need that purpose. What are the things that give me meaning?
It's not because they don't believe in God. It's because they haven't replaced "God" with meaning.
Being idealistic is the most practical thing we need. We need to find something to sustain us.
Other ways to prime ourself? Books, films, movies that makes us feel good.
Should we only visualize the best? Can we not visualize the worst-case scenarios? Why it works - It's useful and it's okay if people don't laugh or you fail because you are human. It allows these emotions, specifically fear and anxiety, to flow through me.
Crying is natural. If we imagine this, stuff go through me to heal the pain. Sometimes if we feel anxious, we have to make things more anxious. Then we let go.
Even a mechanical smile makes us feel better. Forcing yourself to smile actually works lol. Walking confidently actually makes you feel confident.
Catharsis doesn't always work. Crying triggers the natural healer for stuff.
Emotion influences thought. Working out also releases certain chemicals (endorphins etc) that make us feel better.
Seligman's Concepts of Permanence and Pervasiveness - Optimistic interpretation when something good happens = permanent, pervasive
Optimistic interpretation - When something bad happens, its temporary and contained
Ex: Being sick - optimistic = I'll get better. Pessimistic = I'll FUCKING DIE
Ex: Asking them out on a date - optimistic = I'm a stud! pessimistic = she felt sorry, she was drunk
Pessimists actually had more money in a casino.
Tal problem - He has a mild case of ADD, he was kicked out of a program, he was injured in training to be an athlete, he failed a psych PhD test
If he puts it in another way, he gets to say the lessons he learned and his outlook is better. Although he feels sad when sad things happen, he finds out what he wants to do with it.
Study on people with house burned - merit finders = better way of looking things
Heart attack - merit finders were more likely to be alive 8 years later
People writing in a journal were more likely to be happier again
Merit finders are more likely to live longer. Nun study at 85  had 90% of the most cheerful quartile alive. 34% of least cheerful alive. At 94 54% of the most cheerful were alive. 11% of least cheerful alive.
Why isn't everyone optimistic, if it's so good? And how can I become optimistic?
Optimism and positive thinking is considered as unrealistic and detached - because of the media. The media primes us with violence, terrorism, war, etc. What that does is create a very negative schema which says that if you're optimistic, you're unrealistic. 
All media is biased towards the negative. It is not reality.
Most of the things in life are great. We have to realize what is the rule and what is the exception.
We focus on Enron. We focus on Martha Stewart. But there are millions of honest transactions, every day. We extrapolate from a couple of cases where people hurt each other the behavior of people where there are a ton of goodness in people.
We have to separate the media's opinion on us and view the world for the goodness that it is.
 
Lecture 9 - Change
How do we know that the nun study is causation and not just correlation. We can only know that if there is an intervention study.
It's not the thing about getting the best happening, but doing the best with what happens.
People who cognitively reconstructed their cancer and found their positives there were actually healthier. Changing your interpreation = big effect
If we know the importance of priming, why isn't there more positive out there?
Internal chatter is usually "why did I do this" or "I look like an idiot" as opposed to "I like this day" or "I like what I did"
Art - art shows us the ideal and tells us what life is supposed to be.
It is just a part of our evolution to take the exceptions because it would be too much of a hassle if we thought of seeing everything.
When his closest friend died, he didn't think that he would last. Advice: This is going to hurt like hell. I know you may not hear this now, but you're going to get over it. We all do. Because if we hadn't, then God help us all. Everyone experiences loss. Everyone experiences hardships. But we get over.
Bad side = we also adopt to the positive. We take some things for granted. We take our close  relationships for granted. Our parents, our siblings, our wonderful friends.
Oftentimes we appreciate life after something bad has happened. We like eating if we haven't eaten in a long time. Being grateful is the opposite of taking things for granted.
People who are religious are generally happier because they experience gratitude through prayer. So hear prayer or make your own prayer.
Writing the stuff that you're grateful is really good.
Study made - 1 group who wrote 5 things they are grateful for is more likely to help as oppose to group who wrote 5 hassles in their lives
Gratitude becomes a trait through repetition. By being grateful every day
Write down what you are grateful for EVERY DAY. Even when you have a horrible day. 3-5 minutes max, every day.
William James - 21 days to change and create a habit
Tal had a friend who was homeless and super depressed, no money to go back to his own country. He said intuitively, he took a piece of paper and started to write about the wonderful things in his life.
Music, ice cream, family, friends, weather because it wasn't cold, etc. He has this piece of paper and he keeps it with him. We don't need to get to feel bad things before we make ourselves feel better.
We are depriving ourselves of the happiest and best emotions that we can have. Gratitude.
Hellen  Keller who cannot see can appreciate concrete things such as a walk through the woods.
“I wondered how it was possible, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing of note. I who cannot see find hundreds of things: The delicate symmetry of a leaf, the smooth skin of a silver birch, the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. I who am blind can give one hint to those who see: Use your eyes as if tomorrow you will be stricken blind …Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if tomorrow you would never taste or smell again. Make the most of each sense.” 
Though it is true that self-esteem does not change that much, we have to see the exceptions that prove the rule. We know that external circumstances do not affect happiness. We have to find out how to make ourselves happier.
It's not about looking for a quick fix. We have increasing depression in our lives. It's about changing your character and your outlook. 
The problem with quick change is that when it doesn't work, you change your perception and you think that your case is just too far and unsolvable. And then it makes you more depressed.
Biology of change - until 1998 scientists believed that our mind was fixed after the age of 3. In 1998 there was a breakthrough using FMRI that our brain changes until the day we die.
Habits that cultivate make a part of the brain thicker. It's a self-reinforcing process. For positive and negative neural pathways. Our challenge is how do we fortify the part of the neural pathway that makes us an optimist and merit-finder while weakening the neural pathways that are disempowering. 
 
Lecture 10 - The Anatomy of Change
Until 1998, what psychologist believed was that the brain doesn't change from early childhood.
Brain forms neutral pathways until mid-20s. Easier for young people to change than older.
Within our brain, there are healthy and unhealthy pathways. We study which are good and which are bad.
Faultfinder - gets to the neural pathway that "this is bad"
Small events make the meritfinder very happy because reinforcement of these pathways are always given
Failure is opportunity. Reinforce your own behavior so many times to make it automatic. Not "it happens to the best" but "make the best with what happened"
Karen Horney - we can't get rid of our neurosis, but we can do our best to make things better and it starts by accepting it
Safe approach = look at it in hindsight
Acute = Sudden change but also takes long because it has planning behind it.
People who said that they knew that trustworthiness was needed had a hard time shifting from gullibility
People who are	Don't want to give up their
Rigid	Consistency
Gullible	Trustworthiness
Grim	Seriousness
Perfectionists	Drive/ambition
Worriers	Responsibility
Hate relaxing	Edge
Faultfinders	Realism
Unhappy	"no pain no gain"

either consciously or subconsciously.
Recreation, meditation, cognitive therapy can make us change our views on life.
Change your AFFECT, BEHAVIOR, and COGNITION.
Become mindful. Think of thinking. Change is hard. But being mindful works. Our brain actually changes if we meditate regularly, after 8 weeks. The prefrontal cortex grows in proportion to the right side.
Some people connect easily but some take six months. Mindfulness means seeing things as  they are without trying to change it. Be careful without changing it.
PTSM - permanent change and trauma. After traumatic experience people are more stressed. They change the way our brain works. It could be abuse, it could be war.
Question - is there a positive shock treatment that can change the way we can perceive our lives.
Yes there is, there isn't much research, but the equivalent of PTSD is the Peak Experience. PEs can be childbirth, acad excellence, etc.
Everyone has peak experiences. The question is, what do we do with these.
In religion, it's been the religious transformations.
Women, after childbirth, became better and happier and calmer. Listening to a piece of music, walking across a street and realizing the unity of everything.
The class is essentially trying to create peak experiences for the people.
Allow ourselves to get negative experience but don't let them affect your neural pathways. Acceptance then mindfulness.
Meaningful goals. Reflect on the peak experience. Journaling. Attaining coherence. Taking action.
Tal found out from workshops and seminars that people come out with "I'm going to change my life". Then though, there are people that go back to the base level. Then there are some who increase their base level. They were able to have change that lasts beyong the honeymoon phase.
What distinguished both classes? Those with immediate change changed their base level. Those who waited didn't.
Positive attitude change behavior. Also, positive behavior affects attitude.
POWs had changes of behavior about topics when they were asked to speak about things. Again, the mind doesn't want inconsistency between what it thinks and what you do.
It's possible to change things just by the way we move. The way we shake hands, the way we walk, everything affects you as well as yourself.
Study - shy heterosexual men who were anxious asking women out. They have them do a bogus study but between each part, they would have a 12 minute conversation with a woman. Every time they went out the bogus study they talked with women 6 times. After that they did it again the next day (talking with women). Their anxiety had a dramatic reduction a week and 6 months later. The shy men were suddenly dating. 144 minutes of intervention changed a lifelong habit of shyness. 6 months later they were debriefed that they were in an experiment. it was proven that they were not shy.
Courage is not about having no fear. It's about having the fear and going ahead anyway. Very often, by walking upright, by shaking hands and going out of our comfort zone, we can have lasting change.
"Those whose deeds exceed their wisdom,  their wisdom shall endure, but those whose wisdom exceeds their deeds, their widom shall nto endure."
Israel culture is about war but when Tal went to Harvard he got to be in touch with his feminine side. He changed and when he was forced to become more feminine and he did!


 
Lecture 11 - Exiting the Comfort Zone
The fake it till you make it approach might be misconstrued as being unrealistic
The behavioral change happens when you exit the comfort zone. To attain the optimum levels of discomfort.
Arousal - low level = comfort zone = boiling water. lot of change but its uncontrollable
Medium = stretched zone = flowing water
Highest = Panic zone = freezing water
Ex: want to work on physical fitness. low = couch potato. medium = starting gradually high = 10 mile run randomly. unhealthy form of change
med = slightly uncomfortable
sometimes you can't say I'll gradually do things, such as quitting drugs.
the key here is to do it. they have to change the attitudinal change and understanding with action
self-esteem comes from taking risks, even if we can hear our heart beating
thing with risks - it doesn't matter if they say yes or no. ultimately its the doing and the coping that increases with time. we evaluate our selves as if we are an outsider going in.
asking people out takes courage. remember zimbardo study with shy people getting strength to talk to women
the most successful people in the world are also the people who failed the most times. they take risks and go out of their comfort zone
saying no to opportunities means saying yes to ourselves
our goal is to create positive neural pathways with cognition
over time if we learn to interpret stuff positively then we would get better
study: pair of twins which were abused while they were young. they recovered and after a period of time one twin had a bad life - he said "how can you expect me to be any other way knowing my father"
other twin - good life "how can you expect me to be any other way knowing my father?"
exact event, different reactions. "I'm going to be a different dad. I'm going to be that way."
The things imposed on us as a children, it is not easy to get out of. It takes time but it is possible. "Let me appreciate the positive things in life."
Cognitive reconstruction - every thing Tal has taught, he's done it himself.
Don't think of things as threats but as challenges.
arousal as euphoria or anger
study where adrenaline was injected and there was a questionnaire where the questions would intentionally irritate things. people taking the test with the adrenaline were more angry than people without ads. they interpreted their adrenaline as anger.
second group - questionnaire was in a great mood and they were happier than people without adrenaline
ross & samuels - people identified the "nicest" and the most "competitive" friends and they had them go through the prisoner's dilemma.they figured out the cooperativeness and competitiveness of the participants. 
1 group was told it was a community game
1 group was told it was a Wall Street game
the only type of thing that made people competitive or cooperative was not their "personality" but the priming if it was a comm game or wall st game
for intimate long term relationships between friends or couples are ones we go in wanting to express who we are as opposed to going in there to be validated
its easier to go somewhere saying "this is who I am". when we are in to be validated, it's a lose-lose because its either they dont like us, or its they dont like our image
it takes a high price to put on a show for others and act differently
who are we if we lose who we are
study - if it affects physical medication, does the placebo affect behavioral medication?
changing the cognitive interpretation of subjects with exercise improved their cognition and their physiological chars (weight loss, body fat %)
initiating the step of affect behavior and cognition works
with a simple change of interpretation the levels of well-being went up
It takes time to form new neural pathways. sometimes its a click or sometimes its a 15 min presentation or sometimes its something else. These start a positive spiral of growth.
 
Another type of change - The eureka experience
It's not about taking a hammer and sayign its a quick fix.
first step = preparation. immersion in one's self in a topic. before the eurekas they first put in many years of hard work, of learning music
Stuff usually arrives in idle time and JP Morgan said that he needed time off always to do his shit
Eureka = the orgasms
preparation, immersion = foreplay is impt
there are many eurekas out there but not everything gets transferred to something useful
immersing in yourself
The creative process
* Preparation
* Incubation
* Eureka
* Evaluation
* Elaboration/execution
pennybaker 1997 - people who wrote their traumas in a journal, at first they were very anxious but after that it became lower and remained that way consistently
people who wrote random shit (control group) had no change
immune system, overall health was better
writing the best possible experience - results were the same as pennybaker


 
Lecture 12
Most interventions don't work. Journals have research that say that it helps.
Study of people writing their deepest traumas in their journals - results were for the first day, anxiety went up, but over time, it went down, lower than the control group
The study resulted in happier people. Why?
	Positive emotions and negative emotions flow through the same pipeline.
Gender - men benefitted more than women (both had benefitted). Women have better support systems than men. men benefit more than women in marriage for the same reason.

other study - most wonderful moments naman
results were the same
because it wasn't about analyzing, it was replaying it in their head
suppression always intensifies feelings so its always good to open up
the individuals who benefit most are those who introduce a lot of insight phrases "Now I know that..."

stories are easier to remember because of the sense of coherence
we naturally look for meaning in things and it gives us satisfaction
speak about experiences. create stories about it.
life is hard but there are some people who can deal with difficulties better.

components of coherence
1. sense of comprehensibility - i understand the world i get things difficulties and hardships make sense to me mostly
2. sense of manageability - i can deal with it i have my internal and external resources this is a sense of confidence
3.sense of meaningfulness - this is not in vain. this makes sense for me. i have learned from this failure. learning how to make the best of what happens
these are the source of mental health.

affect behavior cognition
C->A->B
low self esteem - low cognition - higher chance to feel down
high self esteem - high motivation - strong emotions - more action, more positive emotions.
anxiety - you have to deal with it
example was prof was a bad squash player
exercise significantly lowers levels of anxiety. exercise is like taking an anti-anxiety pill. yoga helps. relaxing music. behavior.
neurosis is always there. perfectionists will be perfectionists. anxious people wil lbe like that. we have to accept ourselves.
the process matters more than the outcome. it will lead to a happier, not happiest life.

Goal-seting understanding
People who set goals generally are successful because goals focus us.
Being focused about a task makes things work.
Future oriented = always good
necessity = really the mother of invention
you create your own world and works
words are meaningful and create the motivation one needs
whatever you can do to begin begin it
the attainment of goals are not the cause of happiness, but it is understanding the goals and the having of goals
goals are important and it is good to be attached to it as opposed to buddhist non-attachment
similar to budd in the understanding the present
when people retire, they become less happy because no goals
the role of goals is actually means, means toward an end, and the end is the present experiences
GOALS DO NOT MAKE US HAPPIER! its the here and now
learn to enjoy the process
why so many high achievers are unhappy because of the goals are not really the source of happiness eh
they become scared because they suddenly see that their notion of happiness which is achieving goals is not it
happiness is not contingent on our bank account but on our state of mind. on what we choose to focus on. on the present.
the key is the goal and the commitment. the sense of direction is important
live not for battles won but for the alone
do the things that are really important for you!!! 
identify the shit that you REALLY REALLY REALLY want to do and then do them.
just do things for the right reasons.
 
Lecture 13 - Simplify
People living in privileged homes have the feeling that they have to be happy. They say that "what right to do I have to be unhappy?"
There's also guilt and feeling of inadequacy.
When it comes to happiness we are all roughly equal
Emotions are the great equalizer. The question is what do we do with them.
Achievable goals = easiest ever
Pat Riley = motivation is "we're going to think about ourselves and we're going to improve everythng by 1%"
Thinking of brilliant scientists, people would feel that they were superhuman
If the complete story of how things happened though was told, the scientists were seen as human
Every great achievement in history was a thousand mile journey and not a single step.
Divide and conquer stuff
Biographies are good because  you see how people are and you see their failures
Sense of direction is needed to.
Immediate feedback is always good because we are always engaged
Experience for its own sake
Written plan
Set lifelines
Procrastination
70% of college students label themselves as procrastinators
Personal view of procrastination leads to stress and other physio effects
5-minute take-off- most people say that we have to wait to get to the right mood, but research says that if we wait, then we just put off shit. Just jump into it!
It's an illusion that we need to first feel good before.
Reward yourself! Stuff such as I get to do this, etc. 
Go public, declare what you want to do. We have to commit. We have to have the goals up.
Goals, plans, lists.
Issue also is that we can do too much. There is value to recreation.
Creation and receation is related.
Feeling overwhelmed because of too much things to do leads to depression.
It's just not natural for humans to not rest! We have to rest.
Advice = simplify.
Love and sex are negatively affected by stress.
How to simplify? Say yes by saying no.
Middle part as far as activities are would be not having to do too much but also not doing too little. It's like flow.
Life is too short to be in a hurry.
We have to identify our want-tos.
Sometimes it's hard to change because people view the thing they're trying to change for their positive benefits.
It's difficult to say no to things that are offered is because all of us have ingested material perception.
Society tells us that the only thing that matters is matter - the only things that count are the things that can be counted.
Sometimes its counting activities - more is better.
Statistical becomes more important than conceptual
We have too much obsession with material wealth. In the past students wanted to have a meaningful philosophy of life. Now, its about making money.
Lowe likelihood of self-actualization, higher levels of depression, etc
Money is not the end and it is not the ultimate end.
Happiness is the meaning of life. -Aristotle
The very nature of our life is happiness. Whether one believes in a religion or not. -The Dalai Lama
Look for goals involving growth, connection, and contribution as opposed to those with money, beauty, etc
We need to shift the pendulum, as a society to the happiness perception. Realize that the only work of the material is that it only contributes to the ultimate currency. Happiness is the highest end. The key in becoming the happiest lies in perceptions. It's about asking "what is my calling".
What is most meaningful to me.
What provides me the most pleasure.
What am I good at.
The overlap of the three of these questions = what you want to do.
Do things for the right reasons.
We want to have a happiness revolution. This would not be a bloody one. The revolution would come from the inside out.
Happiness, unlike material, is a positive sum game.
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle and the life of the cndle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. -The Buddha
Govt's role - to make available the conditions for happiness. We need to ensure freedom!
Bhutan - gross national happiness
 
 
Lecture 14 - Perfectionism
Playing squash made Tal so stressed out because of his perfectionism. He knew in his mind though that achieving his goals would make the hardships worth it.
Tal feels something in the stomach and he either did everything correctly or he didn't do anything at all.
Change the paradigm from being a perfectionist to be pursuing excellence
It's impossible to do something good without failing so much.
Even something like walking, which is so trivial, is so awesome. And yet we took thousands of tries to get this right.
As kids we know this. We have this innate knowledge and we know that there is no other way to learn. Learn to fail or fail to learn.
Crisis.
Lincoln. Failed a bunch of times, more than you'd think.
Freedom is not worht having if it does not connote freedom to err. - Mohandas Gandhi
Every person in history felt failure and yet did it anyway. -Maslow
Arrogance is not necessarily good but we have to find a graceful intergration between the humility and the pride that is the key to all creative work. Recognize your potential and recognize the inevitability of your imperfections.
The best self-help books out there are biographies.
If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate
Perfectionism is an incapacitating fear of failure that permeates our lives, especially those areas that we care about most.
cognitive/emotional schema that we hold towards the journey from pt a to pt b
perfection vs excellence
Do not generalize - there are gradations to success and failure. do not overgeneralize. look at things half-full and half-empty.
Failure is feedback
Focus on the journey, not on the destination
Rat race = just being better all the time
Just stop when you're happy already.
We derive conclusions about ourselves by seeing how we behave.
 
Lecture 15 - Perfectionism 2
Rat race people focus only on the destination and not on the journey, hence they don't enjoy life that much
Perfectionism causes bulimia etc. It's either perfect diet or binge.
The schema by which we view things coincide with our behaviors and vice-versa. This lesson  is important.
Anxiety is always there for perfectionists
But what about "no pain, no gain"?
Ultimate success = ultimate currency which is being happy
The straight-line schema would cause us to lose motivation easier because there's no intrinsic motivation
Politicians - skilled at creating opportunities, create self-fulfilling prophecies by raising expectations, change from bad luck to good luck
Tal reviews his lecture notes 4 times before going out
4 tips for being lucky
* Listen to your instincts
* Be open to new experiences and break the normal routine
* Spend a few moments each day remembering things that went well. Focus on the full part of the glass
* Visualize yourself being lucky before an impt meeting or telephone call
Pareto's 80/20 rule
Think about your productive hours if its in the morning, afternoon, or night
In our society, success is highly overrated and failure is highly underrated. We aret trained to celebrate the A and the destinations as opposed to the journey. We get this from our teachers, our parents, who got it from their parents.
Research - look at kids who were rewarded for their intelligence vs kids who were not rewarded for intel but for effort
If everything did smoothly, both did okay. If there was a failure possibility, the group rewarded for intel stopped or become anxious, group rewarded for effort became even more energized
Less pain, more gain when rewarded for the journey.
There is no "permission to be human" around us. There's always a pressure to be perfect.
Media stuff such as magazines always have messages to do things faster and take shortcuts
Again a social construction of being perfect = perfect body, etc
"There are 3 billion women who dont look like supermodels and only 8 who do."
"Hey media where we come from cultural and physical diversity is the norm. It's called planet earth.
Movies end where love begins.
It's never a short process!
Neurosis will always be there but only to a degree
We don't need to be dependent on what other people are thinking
We are usually obsessed with feedback.
Accept that a part of being human is to care about what the social environment is telling you to do, but still choose what you want to do. Active acceptance.
Don't apply perfectionism to fix your problem with perfectionism.
Our behavior ultimately gets our attitudes.
Getting criticism makes you want to say "yes, but"
Stay with your failures because always, the pain of the fear of failure is always greater than the failure itself. It's always like this.
Just make some sort of plan but have a  rough draft every time.
Compassion means compassion for others and for one's self. PERMISSION TO BE HUMAN!
How to help others who are perfectionists?
* It's difficult to help others because 1) it has to be a desire to change one's self
* Lead by example
Positive psych should actually be realistic psych. Just tell yourself that failure exists, you learn from failure, give yourself permission to be human, focus on the journey, and live life. Most of our life is the here and now.
Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.
 
Lesson 16 - Making Lasting Change
How do we attain lasting change given that things go back to the base level always?
Mindfulness/meditation works.
Meditation works on the Affective/behavioral/cognitive change.
Meditation was rarely practiced en masse.
Meditation means to familiarize ourselves with our breath, our mind, with other people, with an object, and with thought.
Be in the here and now.
Knowing what you are doing while you are doing it is the essence of mindful training.
We learn to let go of the thoughts and feelings that pull us out of the present moment, and to steady our awareness on our immediate experience.
When weird thoughts pass, just let them pass.
There's no such thing as good or bad meditation. It's about the process.
We cannot thrive psychologically if we're constantly living in the future.
Meeting with  different people from the West and from the East
Lama Oser - experienced meditator and was tested on various parameters.
* Left-to-right ratio in prefrontal cortex. Happier people have a higher ratio in terms of brain activity. More neural activity. Also predicts your physical immune system and 
* High ability in recognizing emotions in others (super-quick facial signals) - high level of empathy - more than any other person measured.  Extremely fast cognitive functioning.
* The startle response - everyone gets startled except  for this guy, who can suppress startled response. He is so relaxed and focus that nothing startles him. First time in recorded history.
o	"Given the larger a person startled, the more intensely that person tends to experiened upsetting emotions, Oser's perf had tantalizing implications, suggesting a remarkable level of emotional equanimity." - Daniel Goleman
o	He influences other people on controversial topics such as being a monk vs being a scientist and reincarnation.
o	People can't  be confrontational and there was some sort of aura where they couldn't be aggressive.
The process itself has some extraordinary qualities by not necessarily the subject. The important ideas is that the process itself is within reach of whoever is doing it.
Meditate. 10 minutes a day.
Lama Oser is the tip of the curve. The point of the research is not about Oser, but its about stretching our assumptions about human possibilty.
Causation - the Lama Oser could be some person with just brilliant genes.
Research about mindfulness meditation (8 weeks of 45 minutes a day)
There was significant changes with less negative and more positive moods during as well as after the program. Left-right prefrontal cortex actually changed.
Meditation gives us conscious living, self-acceptance, self-responsibility, self-assertiveness, purposeful living, and higher personal integrity.
Self-esteem actually increases after meditation
10-15 minutes a day is enough as long as it is done consistently.
Most important step is to breathe correctly
Short breathe signals that we are in a fight or flight state
Mantras - any word. repeat something over and over again.
Music and dance is the number one generator of peak experiences
Really listen to music and be "one with the music"
Yoga benefits - increases self-acceptance, reduces stress and depression, helps overcome ADHD and asthma
Yoga brings people back to the present and reinforces attitudes through persistent behavior (Body feedback hypothesis)
"The richest banquet, the most exotic travel ,the most interesting, attractive lover, the finest home - all of these experiences can seem somehow unrewarding and empty if we don't really attend to them fully - if our minds are elsewhere, preoccupied with disturbing thoughts. By the same token, the simplest of life's pleasures - eating a piece of fresh-baked bread, seeing a work of art, spending moments with a loved one - can be amply rich if we bring a full attention to them. The remedy to dissatisfaction is inside us, in our minds, not in groping for new and different outer sources of satisfaction."
Tara Bennett Goleman


Lesson 17 - Humor and Positive Psychology
Just being in a room with people laughing gets people to have a higher physiological thingie
Humor is a way  of mindfully perceiving the world where an individual is aware of the potentialities in a situation or environment
That things are better now compared to alternatives, or there is an alternative.
Philosophy
* Freud - Humor as "psychological release" - model consciousness - we can't hit people when they offend us but we can make jokes to make it socially acceptable. We often joke about physicality before we can be physical. Same with political figures (we can't do much but we  can at least mock them)
* Bergson - Social blunders, etc are funny because they're a form of social correction
Humor is a cognitive approach of seeing the world in a way that transcends its monotony and boringness
Why are some people more humourous than others?
Experiment about breaking social  norms
Sometimes the framework for evaluation makes things funny - "I cant speak english, I'm the president" - by themselves they wouldn't be funny but when combined they work
Do not assume that there is just one way of viewing reality. Our cognitive mindsets play a big part.
People put in awkward situations with strangers feel more intimate and bonded than people put in normal situations
Why would we date someone with a sense of humor? Hypothesis: We experience the health benefits of humor and we relate this to a better feeling for ourselves
Most of the problems that we have with our leaders is attributed to their lack of humor
A lot of our political problems/relationship problems are because of the inflexibility of our ideologies.
Steps to Increase our Humor
* Write stories that are funny to you
* Watch funny people
* Two questions - "Why am I so funny and why don't others recognize me?"
* Permission to be subhuman - "we're all in this together"
* Finding a balance (where should I be funny?)
* Go 100% (Do it all out and timing is important)
After 9-11 comedians had a hard time making humor but John Stewart says that it's a privilege and not a burden to make people laugh even if things are sad
Attempt to make things human
Humor also demands extraordinary amounts of courage to make things better
 
Lesson 18 - Romantic Relationships
What is love and romantic relationships
Focus on romantic love - tip of the stem between all relationship
67% of couples divorce
We will look at highly successful relationships and see how to get into and manage relationships
Is there such a thing as a perfect relationship or is it a myth
Our needs - autonomy, self-efficacy (confidence), relatedness (relationships)
Identify what is pleasurable for you and what you are good at. That's what you do
Extremely happy people had the same highs and lows as normal and unhappy people but the diff was how long the ups lasted and how long the downs lasted
How many and what kind of relationships you need? Unique to who you are
Too much relationships = diminishing
Introverts vs extroverts
Introverts - base level of cognitive arousal = higher than optimal level - being around many people = overload, need to manage the level of arousal so they are lower
Extroverts - lower - they are always "out there" because they need extra stimulation to get to the optimal level of arousal
Problem: You're an introvert but you want an extrovert type of job or vice versa
You pay a price the first time you try to get out of your nature. Introversion/extroversion is SOMETHING INNATE. Fight it!
Most important component of a fulfilled life = intimate relationship
Romantic Relationship
* Physical intimacy - sex - at highest sex is love made concrete
* Mutual respect and admiration
* Deep friendship
* Spiritual connection
* Equality
* Intimacy, passion, commitment (Sternberg, 1988)
 
Self-sacrifice vs Self-Interest - Do I love because I'm selfish or not
* The case of teaching
o	"I hate teaching but I drag myself and I talk to the class but I do it because I think positive psych is important and I feel a sense of duty to share this. I don't like it but I do it"
o	Vs "I love positive psych, prepare my class, I can't wait to teach it"
o	Would you like the teacher who does it for a sense of duty, or the teacher who wants to do it because they like to
o	The prereq to teaching is you have to do it more than anything else in the world. - This is actually a selfish reason because you derive pleasure from it. But it's not a bad thing that they like to teach! 
* This applies also to relationships. It's not in "it's our duty to be with each other" or "I'd like to be with you". 
* The healthiest rels are ones with the need for perceived equity. They should get stuff from each other (not money but in the currency of happiness). We are better off because of this relationship.
* It's about compromise and standing by your partner. Love expands to another. Our self-interest expands to encompass our partner.
Looking at relationships in movies makes us see larger than life people in a larger than life screen. Movies are literature and they show us what life CAN be.
Fiction vs Reality
* Does true love really exist?
* To be a lover requires the subtlety of the wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain
* Perfect love does not exist, not anywhere. If we think it exists we would search for it and we would experience frustration and disappointment. Being on the receiving end of such expectations is not a good idea. We are human beings and make mistakes.
* True love does exist. You're more likely to be extremely happy if you're in a relationship or you're in a marriage.
Love Wanes Versus Love Grows
* It's true. The 67% divorces prove this.
* We get to confuse lust versus love.
* Who is the fairest of them all? Men = Brad Pitt, Women = Halle Berry
* You have an idea of a perfect man/woman. And yet when you get to a perfect relationship, you get to see them.
* We seek novelty. Novelty produces heightened arousal.
* Exotic becomes erotic. Relationships shift from being passionate to being companionate.
* Sex life can improve over time and it does improve over the years (science)
* For many people, love grows over time. How?
* The more independent we are, the more interdependent can be and the better relationships we can have.
* Love at its best usually comes when you're 50-60 years old, because love and sex is for grown-ups.
* We have to learn to differentiate ourselves to become more independent and knowing what we want to do. Our concordant goals.
* We don't hear this! We hear that love necessarily wanes over time because people fail to distinguish love and lust.
Finding Versus Cultivating
* Problem with movie model = movies end where love begins
* The "one right person" theory is simply not true. No initial conditions promise a relationship that is sustainable and happy. There is always more than one right person for each and every one of us.
* Living happily ever is the difficult part
* Cultivating the one chosen relationship is whats needed
* By observing partners interact, psychologists see which would work and which won't. 94% accuracy
Conflict-free vs Conflict is healthy
* There are no one right relationships. Either passive-aggressive or screaming and shit. All rels have conflicts!
* Ratio is 5 positive : 1 negative. Too high or too low = not good
* Conflict immunizes and makes relationships stronger

 
Lesson 19 - Love 2 - Attracting Love
Key to rels = accentuate the positive
Demonstrate interest
Compliments are free but they yield a lot in regard of the ultimate currency.
Demonstarte empathy
Make love
Communication is the most important thing.
Lust = emotion.
Love = transcends your emotions.
Not just emotion. Use reason!
Don't think that love is inherently msterious and mocks all efforts at rational understanding. If we cannot deepen our graps of at least some of the essentials needed for the success of romantic love, then there is nothing waiting ahead but more centuries of the same suffering
One of the causes of stress within a relationship is people's perceptions, and when a feeling is common in a culture, they hurt not only the society, but the individuals
The lack of respect in women and same-sex marriage has affected how we think
Positive psych is about studying the tip of the stem and applying them to the average population
Being Together by Doing Together
* Superordinate goal
* Mutually meaningful love
* Invest in someone else with your love. Study who they are, really. Be constantly studying your partner. Little things such as what hurts them, how does their mind work, etc.
* Being known rather than being validated
Lust cannot sustain itself over a period of time.
What is the most personal is the most general
Change from telling to sharing
 
Best relationships - partner evaluated higher than what the friends evaluated him/her, these relationships were better and lasted longer
Rels where the partners eval lower lasts shorter
Find merits w/in your partner
The greatest good you can do for your partner is not just to share your riches, but to reveal to him his own
Refocus on the positive using "I fell in love with my partner because..."
Always focus on the positive
Acceptance and respect = also critical in a relaionship
Don't criticise the person, criticise the behavior
Don't take negativity personally. Become less negative towards others but hit them on the ideas, not on the people. Validate and love and know them. Calm down and soothe one another.
Women get back to their base level faster than men.
But in homosexual (not just women-women but men-men) rels it's easier to handle conflict
Collins - "When you must reprimand your child, do so in a loving manner. Don't ever try to degrade or humiliate him. His ego is a precious thing worth preserving."
Acceptance and respect - don't focus on the person
Instead of "you're inconsiderate", go "do you mind putting down the toilet seat?"
Avoid hostility and if you need to argue, argue privately. Wag kang mamamahiya.
We won't treat people we know that much badly but most couples shout and insult one another because we take the good for granted. 
Happy marriages are based on a deep friendship. By this I mean a mutual respect for and enjoyment of each other's company. Love is in the details. It's in the daily stuff.
Attracting Love
1.	Believe in love. Our mind is looking for consistency with things inside and things outside.
2.	When we believe something is attainable then we get lucky.
3.	Find your perfect love! He/she is out there!
 
Cultivate Self-Love
Self-love gets a bad rap because its equated to narcissism and egoistic stuff
Every philo system's foundation is the golden rule. It presupposes self-love. If I don't love myself, then I won't be able to love my neighbor.
To say "I love you", one must first know how to say the "I".
If I see myself as unworthy of love, I'm going to create a reality that love doesn't exist.
It's about showing how worthy we are of the happiness and love of others
To enjoy our own being, to be happy in a profouund sense with who we are, to experience the self...
We get to see people to fall in love with when we aren't looking for love or when we are in a relationship, because our self-esteem is higher and we become more attracted and attractive together
Looking for love cultivates self-love, even if the other person says no
Self-love is about coping and not looking in the mirror
Get out of your comfort zone and stretch
Getting rejected will kill your ego. But courage is about being afraid and going on ahead anyway
Courage. Just do shit and look for opportunities. "Do  you know anyone that I can meet?" Try different things and you deserve an intimate and loving relationship

 
Lesson 20 - Self-Esteem
Staying in rels = is it happy for me to be in this relationship and if it doesnt then its not a relationship
To sustain a relationship means you have your independence
Self esteem correlated to happiness
Self esteem assumption = get external validation and do well = higher self-esteem
The problem was that we up antes to get the same sense of accomplishment because I've done this thing before
The metaphor is Sisyphus and the rock with self-esteem
Paradox is that more success = less self esteem
Self-esteem is a state of being, like flow
the disposition of one's self as competent with the basic challenges of life and as worthy of happiness -nathaniel branden
We need to feel confident, and we need to feel worthy
Of all the judgments we pass on our lives, none is more important than the ones we pass ourselves
The greatest evil that can befall one man would be to think ill of one's self
Self-esteem is associated with mental health
Quality of relationships (long-term)
Yoga, merit-finding, etc, increase your immune system. wth
Humans are natural and feel anxiety but that doesn't mean that they have low self-esteem
low self-esteem was found to be the cause of teen pregnancy, drug abuse, low performance, etc
Egotism = sign of low self-esteem actually
Self-esteem is associated with arrogance and narcissism
"I have high SE" - either a person who has generally have high SE or a braggart (pseudo self-esteem)
Self-esteem surveys lead to unrealistic evaluations
Because of the connections between se and health people try to cultivate se always and they're doing they're wrong. It's not about reinforcing or telling people how good they are thats pseudo-se
Pseudo-se - Self-confidence/self-respect devoid of reality
It's about living the purposeful life
Se cannot attained by itself or something
Sometimes people have low SE and they feel that they do but because their life seems good then other people praise them and they think if they have SE or not
3 components
* Dependent SE - based on other people would say about you, they like activities where they can  judge
o	Worthiness - pakisama, fame
o	Competence - we want to compete vs others, courses are curved
o	Everyone has dependent SE, give yourself the permission to know that you care about what other people think
* Independent SE - based on yourself
o	Worthiness - self-declaring, what do I care about and what am I passionate about
o	Competence - am I a better ** today than before? am I improving and am I better?
o	To get cultivating the independent SE, you have to get the dependent SE first
You're happy to see people in movies be happy. Why can't we do the same for real people?
If we're unable to have independent SE, we can't have unconditional SE for ourselves
PPsych class is essentially about asserting yourself
To command nature is to obey it, ask yourself what does life want out of me. It's never about other people. You live your life by yourself.

 
Lesson 21 
It is possible to have relationships that do not have sex
Parents who give positive feedback na unwarranted have good intentions
Self esteem is product of hard work and very rarely is it genetic
Self-actuatlization and unconditional self-esteem - can we get to a state where we are all about motivation - no. 50 is usually the age where they find S-A people.
Self-esteem is a paradox of "I get more successful but my S-E actually goes down.
SE is not vs others but it is vs yourself
Benefits of being independent - some of the greatest crimes is because of obedience to authority ex: milgram expt, ww2
The more independent you are, the more interdependent you will be
Most successful people = those who ask questions
Baumeister 1996 Paper - Self-esteem assoc with aggression, lack of creativity, poor performance
Conformity was seen though to not be correlated with SE but with SE stability
With SE, people over time with ups/downs were more probable to be more aggresive etc
People with less fluctuations = faster recovery after downs
We cant really get rid of Self-dependent SE
Independent SE was associated with happiness/flow, more than dependent
Higher aggression for people with high dependent SE "I don't want people to think that I'm not good"
For successful long-term rels, the key to success is to become independent - have self-validated intimacy vs dependent self-intimacy
"It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude after own own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude". - Emerson
People have some moments with temporary change and then go back to their normal level
High SE - assertive

To enhance
* Stay calm - reciprocalish
From now on nobody will think of what you do for the rest of your life. No one will know how many people you've helped. No one will know the inventions or how wealthy you are. No one will know what org you started or ppls lives you've changed or houses you own. You  only will know about the wonderful things that you will do in the world. What would you do?
Would I do things if I knew that no one would see it?
Behavior -> Attitude once again and vice-versa
SE means being realistic, and high SE doesnt mean you are arrogant
In a country (US) which praises individualism, there are so many people in the rat race
Because people don't think things through and don't devote time to thinking - we are more likely to conform
Before doing shit, think about it! Real-life examples: torture,  milgram expt, etc
Stage 1 - automatic reaction
Stage 2 - deliberate - reflection/action
People in general lie twice a day - usually about self-impression
being known vs being validated - express not impress - assert yourself
Gradually expanding integrity - just don't lie about yourself to others
Truth sets us free
 
Article - Finding Strength: How to Overcome Anything

http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199805/finding-strength-how-overcome-anything
Teach people how to bounce back - pick yourself up and try again
The ability to rebound is part of the process but it's not magically pain-free or instantaneous.
If you want to see people climbing upward, start at rock bottom.
Someone who tried to put a gun to his head said "I'm not going to die because of what someone else did to me."
* There is no timeline, no set period, for finding strength, resilient behaviors and coping skills.
* About 1/3 of poor neglected abused children are capably building better lives by the time they are teenagrs.
* Faith - in the future, in the world, in a higher power - is an essential ingredient.
* Most Resilient people dont do it alone. A strong family support system is needed.
* Setting goals and planning for the future is a strong factor in dealing with adversity.
* Believeing in oneself and recognizing one's strengths is important. Pick yourself up and give yourself value. If you can't change a bad situation, at least nurture yourself.
* It's equally impt to actually recognize one's own strengths. Many people don't. Teaching them self-recognition is a major part of the approach that psychs use.
Survivor's pride - Reframe how people see you. Instead of telling you're an idiot, say that you're of value. You are an accomplished strategist.
* I am (a person who has faith)
* I have (strong relationships, structure, role models)
* I can (ability to communicate, solve problems)
Emmy Werner study - 505 sugar plantation workers, super poor, guaranteed poverty
* Victim theory would have predicted that they would have crime and umeployed
* A third never sinked - they did well in school and they defined themselves as capable and competent adults
* One's upbringing does not build a lifelong prison. There are those who are determined not to repeat their parents' lives. Abused chidlren do not necessarily become abusers.
There are indivuiduals who have an extraordinary will to transcend
You can teach people to understand consequences. You can teach them ways to find strength. Someone else - parents, teachers, friends - is always needed to transcend trouble. the "we're here to help". the magic is that there is no magic.
Supportive homes are needed and children from them have a great ability to build extended networks
School counts. Really.
"The key person is me. In some ways I was fortunate to learn to rely on myself. I knew I had to make the change. No one else could do it for me."
 
Article - The Perfect Trap

http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199904/the-perfect-trap
Inwardly focused perfectionist vs outwardly focused perfectionist
Inward - Based on your opinion
Outward - Demands perfection from others
The reach of perfection can be painful because it is often drivenby both a desire to do well and a fear of the consequences of not doing well.
Perfectionists are more vulnerable to depression when stressful events occur
Many perfectionists grew up with parents who either directly or indirectly communicated that they were not good enough. Where praise and criticisms were given simultaneously.
"Just get it right this time and I will approve of you." Some psych theories suggest over time that the child's need to please her parents becomes internalized
Perfectionists are...
* May be good or not be good but insits on doing things by themselves
* Tend to think there is a right way and wrong way to do things
* Have trouble making decisions - I don't want to make the wrong one!
* Have trouble takings risks espeically if their reputations are on the line.
Breaking free
* Each of us has a set of central beliefs about ourselves, other people and the world in general. Under each perfectionist schema is a hidden fantasy that some really good thing will come from being perfect
* Change your schema to  more existential goals like self-acceptance, fulfillment, or inner peace
* Ask yourself what are the things toyu would like to change about yourself
* Change "I must have perfection before I have peace of mind" to "I need to give myself credit for what I do well, even if it is not perfect
* If your schema is that other people's opinions of you is a mirror of your self worth, then you must ask yourself if you know when you have done something well. If you're capable of evaluating yourself, you do not really need approval from others.
 
Article - Implicit Theories of Intelligence Predict Achievement Across an Adolescent Transition: A Longitudinal Study and an Intervention

http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic253774.files/April%208%20readings/Blackwell%20Implicit%20Theories.pdf
40% of respondents rated adolescence as worst time of life
Early adolescent years are a critical pt in devt. These children have a good late childhood, and their early adolescent years are marked by normative increases in antisocial behavior and decline in self esteem
Junior high emphasizes competition, social comparison, ability self-assessment
Researchers are curious what makes some students resilient and meet those challennge
Intelligence is a fixed entity vs intelligence as a malleable quality that can be improved
Fixed - believers feel the need to test for the now
Incremental - focuses more on learning goals
It was discovered that students who believed in the incremental view had an advantage over those who believed in the entity view - higher grades
Theories of intel can be manipulated in real-world contexts and have a positive impact on achievement outcomes
Limitations of such studies
* Are students' theories related to their achievement trajectory? Can't be sure if stuff changes over the years
* Why is the theory of intel related to grades? 
* Does teaching an incremental theory provide an added benefit over a similar academic intervention?
Study 1
We studied four waves of enterring jhs students, measured their theories and other achievement related beliefs and then assessed their achievement outcomes. We then integrated a model of the processes linking achievement related beliefs to strategies and output over the jhs transition.
Students were relatively high performing.
Results
An incremental theory of intelligence was positively associated with postive effor beliefs, learning goals, low helpless attributions, and positive strategies.
Grades-wise, the two theories diverged over the last 2 years of junior high school.
 
Lecture - Russell Barkley - ADHD

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyDliT0GZpE
Emotion = motivational state. Level of arousal + approach withdrawal + reward/punishment = motivational aspect of emotion. All emotions are plottd
Motivational dimension can be manipulated by the frontal lobe. This is where you are to motivate yourself. It actually creates a positive motivational moot state, you want that goal, you motivate yourself, and you do things.
Humans only behavior that can maintain behavior for more than a minute without stimulus.
Humans are the only ones that can motivate themselves.
The secret of all success is feasibility to start an idea and to sustain everything in spite of the difficulties and self-disciplined course. They have goals, they have ideas, they want to accomplish things, but they would have a difficulty to obtain. The fuel tank is empty. Though the plans are brilliant, they wont work. 
People with ADHD will always be dependent on the immediate consequences to them. They will be externally dependent for their fuel for behavior. ADD is Motivational Deficit Disorder.
Anterior singulate is 2 separate zones. Upper = helps you make decisions in social conflicts and consequences.
Lower = Whenever there is emotional conflict. If you have emotions the frontal lobe is going to try to restrain it through this zone.
Anterior singulate is smaller in people with ADHD. It also doesn't light up when you have emotions. You have low frustration tolerance, unable to tolerate, showing more emotion, impulsive, easily excitable. Limbic system disorder. It's a failure to regulate mood. The emotions they are having but most people have suppressed them.
ADHD cannot self-calm and self-soothe their emotion. ADHD is not an attention disorder, it is a myopia to future events. Until the futur is imminent, they would try to deal with it. As long as the future stays out there, that's when I'll deal with it.
Everything in life become a crisis because of this point of view. It's more of an Intention Deficit Disorder or short attention span. You can't perform the things you know how to do. It's not a knowledge disorder because you also have the knowledge but they just can't do it.
To change a performance disorder, change it at the point of performance but no amount of treatment will solve it. You have to restructure the environment. ADHD have skills but they have trouble doing it. Even if there are time management options, they won't learn it.
Hyperactivity declines with age. Adults though have an inner restlessness.
The problem with ADHD is that its name itself is very mundane relative to schizo or autism. Inattention is not ADHD. it's a symptom but it's not what it is. Just like autism - it's not being autistic. It's having a lack of empathy.
Self-control is not learned. It is not the result of upbringing. Found from research. Our capacity for ourselves is some neurobiological trait and not something that is learned.
ADHD is a problem with time. It is a delay in the consequence. You have to increase accountability and consequences. You have to force them in delaying. Put artificial consequences in the environment to increase accountability. By excusing from the consequences, you would lessen ADHD.
We have to keep the rewards or anti-consequences in dealing with someone with ADHD.
Myth: adults with ADHD are good in hyperfocusing. Just stop what you are doing. Stop it. Stop it.
Accept your disorder.
Important to understand that ADHD causes ODD (opposition defiant disorder). While ODD has some social influence, half of it is being hard to release frustration and hostility.
ADHD kids have an inablity to keep close and sustained frienships with children. You get to become more frustrated and angry because of ADHD and your friends will dislike you for it. They wont dislike you because of your inattentiveness.
