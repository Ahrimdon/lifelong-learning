## Rework

*Ignore the real world.* The real world isn't a place, it's an excuse. It's a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.

*Learning from mistakes is overrated.* You need to learn from your mistakes. You might learn what not to do again, but how valuable is that? Success gives you real ammunition. When something succeeds, you know what worked--and you can do it again. You still don't know what you should do next. Success is the experience that actually counts.

*Planning is guessing.* Start referring to your business plans as business guesses, your financial plans as financial guesses, and your strategic plans as strategic guesses. Now you can stop worrying about them as much. They just aren't worth the stress. It's OK to wing it.

*Why grow?* Why is expansion always the goal? Grow slow and see what feels right--premature hiring is the death of many companies.

*Workaholism.* Working more doesn't mean you care more or get more done. It just means you work more. It is not sustainable. Workaholics don't save the day, they just use it up.

*Make a dent in the universe.* This is your life's work. Do you want to build just another me-too product or do you want to shake things up? What you do is your legacy.

*Scratch your own itch.* When you build a product or service, you make the call on hundreds of tiny decisions each day. If you're solving someone else's problem, you're constantly stabbing in the dark. When you solve your own problem, the light comes on. You know exactly what the right answer is.

*Draw a line in the sand.* A strong stand is how you attract superfans. You'll turn some people off. That's life. We're willing to lose some customers if it means that others love our products intensely. That's our line in the sand.

*Outside money is Plan Z.* We're in a service economy now. If you're running a business like that, avoid outside funding. Spending other people's money may sound great, but there's a noose attached. Here's why: You give up control. "Cashing out" begins to trump building a quality business. You wind up building what investors want instead of what customers want. Raising money is incredibly distracting. Seeking funding is difficult and draining.

*You need less than you think.* There's nothing wrong with being frugal. When we launched our first product, we did it on the cheap. We didn't get our own office; we shared space with another company. We didn't get a bank of servers; we had only one. We didn't advertise; we promoted by sharing our experiences online. We didn't hire someone to answer customer e-mails; the company founder answered them himself. And everything worked out just fine. Great companies start in garages all the time. Yours can too. 

*Building to flip is building to flop.* You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. If your whole strategy is based on leaving, chances are you won't get far in the first place. Move to an island and sip pina coladas all day? Will that really satisfy you? Will money alone truly make you happy? Are you sure you'll like that more than running a business you actually enjoy and believe in? That's why you often hear about business owners who sell out, retire for six months, and then get back in the game. They miss the thing they gave away.

*Less mass.* Long-term contracts, excess staff, permanent decisions, meetings, thick process, inventory (physical or mental), hardware, software, and technology lock-ins, long-term road maps, office politics. Avoid these things whenever you can. That way, you'll be able to change direction easily.

*Less is a Good Thing.* Embrace constraints. Limited resources force you to make do with what you've got. There's no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative. We make sure to have only one or two people working on a product at a time. And we always keep features to a minimum.

*Build half a product, not a half-assed product.* You can turn a bunch of great ideas into a crappy product real fast by trying to do them all at once. You just can't do everything you want to do and do it well.

*Start at the epicenter.* There's the stuff you could do, the stuff you want to do, and the stuff you have to do. The stuff you have to do is where you should begin. So ignore the details--for a while. Nail the basics first and worry about the specifics later.

*Making the call is making progress.* Whenever you can, swap "Let's think about it" for "Let's decide on it." Commit to making decisions. You can't build on top of "We'll decide later," but you can build on top of "Done." Long projects zap morale. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch. Make the call, make progress, and get something out now--while you've got the motivation and momentum to do so.

*Be a curator.* What makes a museum great is the stuff that's not on the walls. Someone says no. It's the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, simplify, and streamline.

*Throw less at the problem.* When things aren't working, the natural inclination is to throw more at the problem. That's a fool's path. You start focusing on fashion instead of substance. The core of your business should be built around things that won't change.

*Tone is in your fingers.* In business, too many people obsess over tools, software tricks, scaling issues, fancy office space, lavish furniture, and other frivolities instead of what really matters. And what really matters is how to actually get customers and make money.

*Sell your by-products.* When you make something, you always make something else. You can't make just one thing. Everything has a by-product. Software companies don't usually think about writing books. Bands don't usually think about filming the recording process. Car manufacturers don't usually think about selling charcoal. There's probably something you haven't thought about that you could sell too.

*Launch now.* If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out? Funny how a question like that forces you to focus. Don't mistake this approach for skimping on quality, either. You still want to make something great. This approach just recognizes that the best way to get there is through iterations.

## Productivity

####  Reasons to quit: Ask yourself these questions:

- Why are you doing this? What is this for? Who benefits? What's the motivation behind it?
- What problem are you solving? What's the problem? Are cx confused, or is there something not clear enough?
- Is this actually useful? Are you making somehting useful or just making something? It's easy to confuse enthusiasm with usefulness.
- Are you adding value? Adding something is easy; adding value is hard. Is this thing you're working on actually making your product valuable for cx? Can they get mor out of it than before?
- Will this change behavior?
- Is there an easier way?
- What could you be doing instead?
- Is it really worth it? Is the meeting worth pulling 6 people off work? Is it worth pulling an all-nighter, or could you just finish it tomorrow? Is it worth getting stressed over a competitor's press release? It it worth spending your money on advertising?

####  Meetings are toxic 

*The worst interruptions of all are meetings.* Here's why: 

- They're usually about words and abstract concepts, not real things. 
- They usually convey an abysmally small amount of information per minute.
- They drift off-subject easier than a Chicago cab in a snowstorm. 
- They require thorough preparation that most people don't have time for. 
- They frequently have agendas so vague that nobody is really sure of the goal.- They often include at least one moron who inevitably gets his turn to waste everyone's time with nonsense. 

When you think about it, the true cost of meetings is staggering. Let's say you're going to schedule a meeting that lasts one hour, and you invite ten people to attend. That's actually a ten-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting. You're trading ten hours of productivity for one hour of meeting time.

#### Fixing a Meeting

- Set a timer. When it rings, meeting's over. Period. 
- Invite as few people as possible. 
- Always have a clear agenda. 
- Begin with a specific problem. 
- Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes. 
- End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it. 

*Illusions of agreement.* If you need to explain something, try getting real with it. Instead of describing what something looks like, draw it. That's why you want to get to something real right away. That's when you get true understanding. Get the chisel out and start making something real. Anything else is just a distraction.

*Interruption is the enemy of productivity.* When do you get most of your work done? If you're like most people, it's at night or early in the morning. It's no coincidence that these are the times when nobody else is around. Interruption is not collaboration, it's just interruption. And when you're interrupted, you're not getting work done. You can't get meaningful things done when you're constantly going start, stop, start, stop.

*Good enough is fine.* Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. Judo solutions are all about getting the most out of doing the least. When good enough gets the job done, go for it.

*Quick wins.* The way you build momentum is by getting something done and then moving on to the next thing. No one likes to be stuck on an endless project with no finish line in sight. *The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it.* If you absolutely have to work on long-term projects, try to dedicate one day a week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm.

*Don't be a hero.* Sometimes that kind of sheer effort overload works. But is it worth it? Probably not. So we decided that if anything takes one of us longer than two weeks, we've got to bring other people in to take a look. If you already spent too much time on something that wasn't worth it, walk away. You can't get that time back. The worst thing you can do now is waste even more time.

*Your estimates suck.* Reality never sticks to best-case scenarios. That's why estimates that stretch weeks, months, and years into the future are fantasies. Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate.

Long lists don't get done. Long lists collect dust. Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it. For example, break a single list of a hundred items into ten lists of ten items. Yes, you still have the same amount of stuff left to do. But now you can look at the small picture and find satisfaction, motivation, and progress.

*Make tiny decisions.* When you make tiny decisions, you can't make big mistakes. These small decisions mean you can afford to change. There's no big penalty if you mess up. You just fix it. Attainable goals like that are the best ones to have. Ones you can actually accomplish and build on. You get to say, "We nailed it. Done!"

## Competitors 

*Don't copy.* The problem with this sort of copying is it skips understanding--and understanding is how you grow. You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that. So much of the work an original creator puts into something is invisible. Plus, if you're a copycat, you can never keep up. You're always in a passive position. How do you know if you're copying someone? If someone else is doing the bulk of the work, you're copying. Be influenced, but don't steal.

*Decommoditize your product.* But there's a great way to protect yourself from copycats: Make you part of your product or service. Inject what's unique about the way you think into what you sell. Zappos sets itself apart by injecting CEO Tony Hsieh's obsession with customer service into everything it does. Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it.

*Pick a fight.* If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you'll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side. Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers, too. Taking a stand always stands out. And that's a good way to get people to take notice. 

*Underdo your competition.* When you get suckered into an arms race, you wind up in a never-ending battle that costs you massive amounts of money, time, and drive. And it forces you to constantly be on the defensive, too. Defensive companies can't think ahead; they can only think behind. Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition.

*Who cares what they're doing?* In the end, it's not worth paying much attention to the competition anyway. It's a terrible mindset that leads to stress and anxiety. It's a pointless exercise anyway. The competitive landscape changes all the time. Your competitor tomorrow may be completely different from your competitor today. It's out of your control. What's the point of worrying about things you can't control? 

## Evolution

*Say no by default.* Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. Making a few vocal customers happy isn't worth it if it ruins the product for everyone else. Don't be a jerk about saying no, though. Just be honest. If you're not willing to yield to a customer request, be polite and explain why.

*Let your customers outgrow you.* We'd rather our customers grow out of our products eventually than never be able to grow into them in the first place.  When you let customers outgrow you, you'll most likely wind up with a product that's basic--and that's fine. There are always more people who are not using your product than people who are. Make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board.

*Be at-home good.* When you get the product home, you're actually more impressed with it than you were at the store. A product that executes on the basics beautifully may not seem as sexy as competitors loaded with bells and whistles.  You can't paint over a bad experience with good advertising or marketing.

*Don't write it down.* Listen, but then forget what people said. The requests that really matter are the ones you'll hear over and over. Your customers will be your memory. They'll keep reminding you. They'll show you which things you truly need to worry about.

## Promotion

#### Marketing is not a department.

*Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365.*
 
Every time you answer the phone, it's marketing. 

Every time you send an e-mail, it's marketing. 
 
Every time someone uses your product, it's marketing. 
 
*Every word you write on your Web site is marketing.* 
 
If you build software, every error message is marketing. 
 
If you're in the restaurant business, the after-dinner mint is marketing. 
 
If you're in the retail business, the checkout counter is marketing. 
 
If you're in a service business, your invoice is marketing. 
 
*Recognize that all of these little things are more important than choosing which piece of swag to throw into a conference goodie bag.* Marketing isn't just a few individual events. It's the sum total of everything you do.

*Welcome obscurity.* Use this time to make mistakes without the whole world hearing about them. Obscurity helps protect your ego and preserve your confidence. You don't want everyone to watch you starting your business. It makes no sense to tell everyone to look at you if you're not ready to be looked at yet. And keep in mind that once you do get bigger and more popular, you're inevitably going to take fewer risks. Now's the time to take risks without worrying about embarrassing yourself.

*Build an audience.* The most fortunate companies have audiences. Instead of going out to reach people, you want people to come to you. This is the most receptive group of customers and potential customers you'll ever have. When you build an audience, you don't have to buy people's attention--they give it 
*to you.*

*Out-teach your competition.* Teaching probably isn't something your competitors are even thinking about. Most businesses focus on selling or servicing, but teaching never even occurs to them. Teach and you'll form a bond you just don't get from traditional marketing tactics. They'll respect you more. Even if they don't use your product, they can still be your fans. 

*Emulate chefs.* The great chefs share everything they know. They put their recipes in cookbooks and show their techniques on cooking shows. A recipe is much easier to copy than a business. They know those recipes and techniques aren't enough to beat them at their own game.

*Go behind the scenes.* Imagine that someone wanted to make a reality show about your business. What would they share? Even seemingly boring jobs can be fascinating when presented right. People love finding out the little secrets of all kinds of businesses, even one that makes those tiny marshmallows in breakfast cereals. People are curious about how things are made. They want to know how and why other people make decisions.

*Nobody likes plastic flowers.* Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to real. Don't worry about how you're supposed to sound and how you're supposed to act. It's also about simplicity. You strip things down and then use what you have. Leonard Koren, author of a book on wabi-sabi, gives this advice: Pare down to the essence, but don't remove the poetry. Keep things clean and unencumbered but don't sterilize. When something  becomes too polished, it loses its soul. So talk like you really talk. Reveal things that others are unwilling to discuss. Be upfront about your shortcomings. Show the latest version of what you're working on, even if you're not done yet. It's OK if it's not perfect. You might not seem as professional, but you will seem a lot more genuine.

*Press releases are spam.* That's what press releases are too: generic pitches for coverage sent out to hundreds of journalists you don't know, hoping that one will write about you. Why spam journalists when their inbox is already filled with other people's spam? Instead, call someone. Pitch her with some passion, some interest, some life. Do something meaningful. Be remarkable. Stand out. Be unforgettable. That's how you'll get the best coverage.

*Drug dealers get it right.* They know their product is so good they're willing to give a little away for free upfront. They know you'll be back for more-- with money. Make your product so good, so addictive, so "can't miss" that giving customers a small, free taste makes them come back with cash in hand. This will force you to make something about your product bite-size.

*The myth of the overnight sensation.* No one cares about you. At least not yet. Get used to it. Dig deeper and you'll usually find people who have busted their asses for years to get into a position where things could take off. Trade the dream of overnight success for slow, measured growth. Don't bother hiring a PR firm. Once you have some customers and a history, you'll have a story to tell.

## Hiring

*Do it yourself first.* Never hire anyone to do a job until you've tried to do it yourself first. That way, you'll understand the nature of the work. You'll know what a job well done looks like. You'll know how to write a realistic job description and which questions to ask in an interview. You'll also be a much better manager, because you'll be supervising people who are doing a job you've done before. 

*Hire when it hurts.* Always ask yourself: What if we don't hire anyone? Can we solve the problem with a slice of software or a change of practice instead? Similarly, if you lose someone, don't replace him immediately. You'll often discover you don't need as many people as you think. The right time to hire is when there's more work than you can handle for a sustained period of time. 

*Strangers at a cocktail party.* Hire a ton of people rapidly and a "strangers at a cocktail party" problem is exactly what you end up with. There are always new faces around, so everyone is unfailingly polite. You need to be able to tell people when they're full of crap. If that doesn't happen, you start churning out something that doesn't offend anyone but also doesn't make anyone fall in love.

*Resumes are ridiculous.* We all know resumes are a joke. They're exaggerations. Worst of all, they're too easy. Anyone can create a decent-enough resume. That's why half-assed applicants love them so much. They don't care about landing your job; they just care about landing any job. If you hire based on this garbage, you're missing the point of what hiring is about. You want a specific candidate who cares specifically about your company, your products, your customers, and your job. So how do you find these candidates? Cover letter.

*Years of irrelevance.* It takes that long to internalize the idioms, learn how things work, understand the relevant tools, etc. But after that, the curve flattens out. There's surprisingly little difference between a candidate with six months of experience and one with six years. The real difference comes from the individual's dedication, personality, and intelligence. How long someone's been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well they've been doing it.

*Forget about formal education.* Ninety percent of CEOs currently heading the top five hundred American companies did not receive undergraduate degrees from Ivy League colleges. Some of the misguided lessons you learn in academia: The longer a document is, the more it matters. Stiff, formal tone is better than being conversational. Using big words is impressive. You need to write a certain number of words or pages to make a point. The format matters as much (or more) than the content of what you write. It's no wonder so much business writing winds up dry, wordy, and dripping with nonsense. The pool of great candidates is far bigger than just people who completed college with a stellar GPA.

*Hire managers of one.* Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. They do what a manager would do--set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc.--but they do it by themselves and for themselves. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they've gotten done. They don't need a lot of hand-holding or supervision. How can you spot these people? Look at their backgrounds. They've run something on their own or launched some kind of project. You want someone who's capable of building something from scratch and seeing it through. Finding these people frees the rest of your team to work more and manage less.

*Test-drive employees.* Some people sound like pros but don't work like pros. You need to evaluate the work they can do now, not the work they say they did in the past. The best way to do that is to actually see them work. Hire them for a miniproject, even if it's for just twenty or forty hours. You'll see how they make decisions. You'll see if you get along. You'll see what kind of questions they ask. You'll get to judge them by their actions instead of just their words.

## Damage Control

*Own your bad news.* When something goes wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You'll be better off if it's you. When something bad happens, tell your customers (even if they never noticed in the first place). Tips: The message should come from the top. The highest-ranking person available should take control in a forceful way. Spread the message far and wide. Use whatever megaphone you have. Don't try to sweep it under the rug. "No comment" is not an option. Apologize the way a real person would and explain what happened in detail. Honestly be concerned about the fate of your customers--then prove it.

*Speed changes everything.* Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service. It's amazing how much that can defuse a bad situation and turn it into a good one. Some people may even make threats or call you names. Don't take it personally. They think that's the only way to be heard. Once you answer quickly, they shift 180 degrees. They light up. They become extra polite. It's especially true if you offer a personal response. Customers are so used to canned answers, you can really differentiate yourself by answering thoughtfully and showing that you're listening. And even if you don't have a perfect answer, say something. "Let me do some research and get back to you" can work wonders.

*How to say you're sorry.* There's never really a great way to say you're sorry, but there are plenty of terrible ways. One of the worst ways is the non-apology apology, which sounds like an apology but doesn't really accept any blame. "We're sorry if this upset you." A good apology accepts responsibility. It has no conditional if phrase attached.

_"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused."_

- "We apologize": You don't say "We apologize" to people if you spill their coffee. You say "I'm sorry". Use the appropriate tone and language to show that you understand the severity of what happened. "I" is stronger than "we".
- "Any inconvenience": It's not an inconvenience. It's a crisis.
- "This may have caused": "May" implies there might not be anything wrong at all, when obviously something is.

The number-one principle to keep in mind when you apologize: How would you feel about the apology if you were on the other end?

Keep in mind that you can't apologize your way out of being an ass. Even the best apology won't rescue you if you haven't earned people's trust. Everything you do before things go wrong matters far more than the actual words you use to apologize.

*Put everyone on the front lines.* The people who make the product work in the "kitchen" while support handles the customers. Unfortunately, that means the product's chefs never get to directly hear what customers are saying.Listening to customers is the best way to get in tune with a product's strengths and weaknesses. Everyone on your team should be connected to your customers--maybe not every day, but at least a few times throughout the year. That's the only way your team is going to feel the hurt your customers are experiencing. It's feeling the hurt that really motivates people to fix the problem. And the flip side is true too: The joy of happy customers or ones who have had a problem solved can also be wildly motivating. 

*Take a deep breath.* After you introduce a new feature, change a policy, or remove something, knee-jerk reactions will pour in. Resist the urge to panic or make rapid changes in response. If you ride out that first rocky week, things usually settle down. Also, remember that negative reactions are almost always louder and more passionate than positive ones. So when people complain, let things simmer for a while. Let them know you're listening. But explain that you're going to let it go for a while and see what happens.

## Culture

*You don't create a culture.* You don't create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don't have a culture. Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior. If you encourage people to share, then sharing will be built into your culture. If you reward trust, then trust will be built in. If you treat customers right, then treating customers right becomes your culture. Culture isn't a foosball table or trust falls. It isn't policy. It isn't the Christmas party or the company picnic. Those are objects and events, not culture. And it's not a slogan, either.

*Decisions are temporary.* Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. It's easy to shoot down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end. It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Getting a product or service off the ground is hard enough without inventing even more obstacles. 

*Skip the rock stars.*  We're all capable of bad, average, and great work. The environment has a lot more to do with great work than most people realize. Cut the crap and you'll find that people are waiting to do great work. Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility. They're a result of giving people the privacy, workspace, and tools they deserve. Great environments show respect for the people who do the work and how they do it.

*They're not thirteen.* When you treat people like children, you get children's work. When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of nonthinkers. You create a boss-versus-worker relationship that screams, "I don't trust you." And look, you're not going to get a full eight hours a day out of people anyway.

*Send people home at 5.* You don't need more hours; you need better hours. When people have something to do at home, they get down to business. They get their work done at the office because they have somewhere else to be. As the saying goes, "If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know." You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care about more than one thing. You shouldn't expect the job to be someone's entire life--at least not if you want to keep them around for a long time.

*Don't scar on the first cut.* Policies are organizational scar tissue. They are codified overreactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again. They are collective punishment for the misdeeds of an individual. This is how bureaucracies are born. Don't create a policy because one person did something wrong once. Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over again.

*Sound like you.* When you speak big, you sacrifice one of a small company's greatest assets: the ability to communicate simply and directly, without running every last word through a legal-and PR-department sieve. Language is often your first impression--why start it off with a lie? Don't be afraid to be you. Talk to customers the way you would to friends. Explain things as if you were sitting next to them. Avoid jargon or any sort of corporate-speak. Write to be read, don't write just to write. Whenever you write something, read it out loud. Does it sound the way it would if you were actually talking to someone? If not, how can you make it more conversational? And when you're writing, don't think about all the people who may read your words. Think of one person. Then write for that one person.

*Four-letter words.* There are four-letter words you should never use in business. They're not fuck or shit. They're need, must, can't, easy, just, only, and fast. These words get in the way of healthy communication. When you use these four-letter words, you create a black-and-white situation. 

Here's what's wrong with some of them:

- Need. Very few things actually need to get done. Instead of saying "need," you're better off saying "maybe" or "What do you think about this?" or "How does this sound?" or "Do you think we could get away with that?" 
- Can't. When you say "can't," you probably can. Sometimes there are even opposing can'ts: "We can't launch it like that, because it's not quite right" versus "We can't spend any more time on this because we have to launch." Both of those statements can't be true. Or wait a minute, can they? 
- Easy. Easy is a word that's used to describe other people's jobs. "That should be easy for you to do, right?" But notice how rarely people describe their own tasks as easy. For you, it's "Let me look into it"--but for others, it's "Get it done."
 
These four-letter words often pop up during debates (and also watch out for their cousins: everyone, no one, always, and never). Once uttered, they make it tough to find a solution. They box you into a corner by pitting two absolutes against each other. That's when head-butting occurs. You squeeze out any middle ground. And these words are especially dangerous when you string them together: "We need to add this feature now. We can't launch without this feature. Everyone wants it. It's only one little thing so it will be easy. You should be able to get it in there fast!" Only thirty-six words, but a hundred assumptions. That's a recipe for disaster.

## Conclusion: Inspiration is perishable 

*We all have ideas.* Ideas are immortal. They last forever. What doesn't last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It has an expiration date. If you want to do something, you've got to do it now. You can't put it on a shelf and wait two months to get around to it. You can't just say you'll do it later. Later, you won't be pumped up about it anymore. If you're inspired on a Friday, swear off the weekend and dive into the project. When you're high on inspiration, you can get two weeks of work done in twenty-four hours. Inspiration is a time machine in that way. Inspiration is a magical thing, a productivity multiplier, a motivator. But it won't wait for you. Inspiration is a now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to work.
