# First Principles: The Building Blocks of True Knowledge
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)

- The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. It’s one of the best ways to learn to think for yourself, unlock your creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.
- Learning has to be by understanding, not rote.
- *A first principle is a foundational proposition or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption.*
  - First principles: The first basis from which a thing is known.
  - NFL: Every play was at some point created by someone who thought, "What would happen if the players did this?" and went out and tested the idea.
  - First principles in football: the rules. Everything is possible as long as it's not against the rules. This is why you can steal plays. But since the coach knew why he made that play, unlike the play stealer, he can course-correct.
  - The play stealer is the person who reasons by analogy, and the coach as someone who reasons by first principles.
- Reasoning by first principles vs reasoning by analogy: like the difference between being a chef and being a cook.
  - If the cook lost the recipe, he'd be screwed.
  - The chef understands the flavor profiles and combinations at such a fundamental level that he doesn't even use a recipe. He has real knowledge as opposed to know-how.

## Authority

- We believe a lot of things because of authority.
- If you outright reject dogma, you become a problem.
- *When you can’t change your mind, though, you die. "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it."*
- FP reasoning cuts through dogma. When it comes down to it, everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoins. The list goes on.

## Tech for Establishing FP

- Socratic Questioning:
  - Why do I think this?
  - How do I know this is true?
  - How can I back this up?
  - What might others think?
  - What if I'm wrong?
  - Why did I think that?
- Try to never get to "Because I said so".
- Elon:
  - "I think people's thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It's rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis They'll say, 'We'll do that because it's always been done that way.' You have to build the reasoning from the ground up. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and they you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn't work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past."
  - *Start with what is true, not with your intuition.*
  - Ex: When he thinks of the rockets, he asks, what is the physics of a rocket, and how much will it cost? Then, he asks what contributes to that cost, and what do those actually cost?
- People say things like "battery packs are expensive and that's the way it's always been." Sort of dumb because if you apply that reasoning to anything, then you wouldn't be able to get to that new thing.
  - Battery packs: what are those things made off of?
- Buzzfeed:
  - The first principle of a successful website: wide distribution. BF focuses on publishing those that people want to read. Aiming to garner maximum social shares. Ignoring SEO, and they just made content robots like.
  - Obsessive measurement: A/B testing and analytics.
  - First principles of virality: *Keep it short. Ensure [that] the story has a human aspect. Give people the chance to engage. And let them react. People mustn't feel awkward sharing it. It must feel authentic. Images and lists work. The headline must be persuasive and direct.*
- First Principles in Daily Life:
  - Clearing the clutter of what you tell yourself, and allowing you to rebuild from the ground up.
  - "Too much information" → Reading everything is unsustainable, so understand the variables that will affect their investments.
  - "We need to move first." → The iPhone wasn't first, it was better. Lot of evidence that first movers are more likely to fail than latecomers.
  - "I can't do that, it's never been done before."

# Conclusion

- The thoughts of others imprison us if we're not thinking for ourselves.
- Try doing this when you are:
  - Doing something for the first time.
  - Dealing with complexity.
  - Trying to understand a situation that you're having problems with.
- Analogies can't replace understanding. While it's easier on your brain to reason by analogy, you're more likely to come up with better answers when you reason by first principles.
- ***The evidence is that creativity is not something that some of us are born with.*** As adults, we rely on convention and what we're told because that's easier than breaking things down into first principles and thinking for ourselves.
- Musk: "I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can."
