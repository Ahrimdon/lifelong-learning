### TL, DR:

- Information overload sucks, so we aggressively filter. Noise becomes signal.
- Lack of meaning is confusing, we we fill in the gaps. Signal becomes a story.
- Need to act fast lest we lose our chance, so we jump to conclusions. Stories become decisions.
- This isn't getting easier, so we try to remember the important bits. Decisions inform our mental models of the world.

### Biases help us address:

- ***Too much information.***
  - We notice things that are already primed in memory or repeated often.
  - Bizarre/funny/visually-striking/anthropomorphic things stick out more than non-bizarre/unfunny things.
  - We noticed when something has changed. We generally weight the significance of the new value by the direction the change happened more than re-evaluating the value as if it had been presented alone.
  - We are drawn to details that confirm our own existing beliefs.
  - We notice flaws in others more easily than flaws in ourselves.
- ***Not enough meaning.***
  - We find stories and patterns even in sparse data.
  - We fill in characteristics from stereotypes, generalities, and prior histories whenever that are new specific instances or gaps in information.
  - We imagine things and people we're familiar with or fond of as better than things than people we aren't familiar with or fond of.
  - We simplify probabilities and numbers to make them easier to think about.
  - We think we know what others are thinking.
  - We project our current mindset and assumptions onto the past and future.
- ***Need to act fast.***
  - In order to act, we need to be confident in our ability to make an impact and to feel like what we do is important.
  - In order to stay focused, we favor the immediate, relatable thing in front of us over the delayed and distant.
  - In order to get anything done, we're motivated to complete things that we've already invested time and energy in.
  - In order to avoid mistakes, we're motivated to preserve our autonomy and status in a group, and to avoid irreversible decisions.
  - We favor options that appear simple or that have more complete information over more complex, ambiguous options.
- ***What should we remember?***
  - We edit and reinforce memories after the fact.
  - We discard specifics to form generalities. (Stereotypes/prejudice.)
  - We reduce events and lists to their key elements.
  - We store memories differently based on how they were experienced.
