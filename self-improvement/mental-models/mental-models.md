## Mental models
[Reference](http://www.defmacro.org/2016/12/22/models.html)

### Productivity

- Small-improvements: Frequently making small incremental models is better than fixing big ones.
- Just get started: Starting to work on a small, concrete, finishable problem puts your consciousness in a productive state. Just do something (laundry, cooking).
- Top five problems: What are the top five most important problems in my field and in my life, and why am I not working on them?
- LRU: Since you can only work on one problem a time, pick the most important one, work on that, and ignore everything else. (Works for email and physical possessions).
- Teaching method: Put yourself in a position where you have to teach someone the basics.
- Planning fallacy: humans are very optimistic. So be pessimistic when estimating. One week, turn it to two months.
- Forcing function: an external/social constraint that increases the probability of accomplishing a set of tasks (ex: pair programming).

### Hypothesis evaluation

- Efficient market: The state of any given issue is roughly as close to optimal as it is currently possible. (It's unlikely that the status quo can be easily improved without significant resources).
- Statistical mechanics: Probabilistic systems that follow certain laws have perturbations that diverge from these laws in th short run (occasionally the status quo CAN be improved without significant resources, but it is unlikely that you have found such an occasion).
- Base rates: You can approximate the likelihood of a specific event occurring by examining the wider probability distribution of similar events.
- `Emic` vs `Etic`: Outside view: only requires you to ask, what kind of person does sincerely believing this stuff turn you into?

### Decision making

- Inversion: Figure out what you don't want, and try to avoid it.
- Bias for action: Better to move quickly and recover if you were wrong, than to deliberate indefinitely. Best: right thing, next best: wrong thing, worst: doing nothing.
- Expected value.
- Marginal utility.
- Strategy/tactics: strategic = long-term, gradual effects, tactics = short-term quick binary resolutions.

### People

- IQ, RQ, EQ: IQ = mind's raw power. RQ = how well the mind's models map to the real world. EQ = ability to recognize and label emotions.
- Structure and agency: the observation that human behavior derives from a balance of internalized cultural patterns. People like structure. Pay attention to how people perceive their own roles.
- Social status: that SS is so important to humans, that modelling status alone results in extremely realistic performances.
- Controlled vulnerability: that humans are attracted to confidently expressed vulnerability in others, but are scared to be vulnerable themselves.

### Groups

- Mere-exposure effect: humans develop a preference for things, people, and processes merely because they are familiar with them. The effect is much stronger than it initially seems.

### Communication:

- Story arc: human beings are wired to respond to storytelling. You can structure ideas to tap into this response.
- Writing well: Never use a long word when a short one will do.
- Charitable interpretation: consider the best, strongest, possible interpretation.
- Nonviolent communication: Express facts, express feelings, express needs, and make a request. "You didn't turn in the project yesterday. When that happened, I felt betrayed. I need to be able to rely on you to have a productive relationship. In the future, could you notify me in advance if something like that happens?"

### Policy

- Global utility maximization: Usually better to optimize for the needs of the many, not for an idealistic notion of fairness.
- Tragedy of the commons.
- Front page test: evaluating an action through the lens of the outside world.
- Reasonable person principle. Reasonable people strike a suitable balance between their own immediate desires and the good of the community at large. Fire people who are offensive or are easily offended.
- Overton window: the range of ideas a group can accept.
- Political capital: the trust and influence a leader wields with other people.

### Product design

- Target market.
- Internal press release: try writing an internal press release first, explaining to target customers why the product is useful and how it blows away the competition. Then, you can test it against potential users. If the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck.
- Quantum of utility: There must be at least some set of users who would be excited to hear about it, because NOW THEY CAN DO SOMETHING THEY COULDN'T DO BEFORE. Private beta, giving a product to a friend.
- Worse is better: Solving the customer's problem outperforms "beautiful" products.
- Kano model: Categorizing possible features to optimize resource allocation.

### Business

- Five forces: analyzes the competitive intensity and therefore attractiveness of an industry.
  - Threat of new entrants.
  - Threat of substitutes.
  - Bargaining power of buyers.
  - Bargaining power of suppliers.
  - Industry rivalry.
- Power of defaults. Better to capture mindshare before people's minds are made up, than to change their mind later.
- Economies of scale.
- Price/performance curve.
