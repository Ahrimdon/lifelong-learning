# The Best Way to Find More Time to Read
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2013/09/finding-time-to-read/)

- Reading isn't something to be done once a week to check a box; it's something to do every day.
- If you're a knowledge worker, you're paid to use your brain, so it's in your best interest to make that brain as big as possible.
- Wherever I go, a book is not far behind. It might be on my phone or physical, but there is always a book close by.
- Ignorance is more expensive than a book.
- *To me, reading is more than a raw input. I read to increase knowledge. I read to find meaning. I read for better understanding of others and myself. I read to discover. I read to make my life better. I read to make fewer mistakes.*
- Even Nassim Taleb, author of Antifragile, points out that several ancient philosophers grasped the concept of antifragility. Odds are that no matter what you're working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.
- In The Prince, Machiavelli writes, “A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savor of it.” That's not to say that this is the only way, but why not start with the best thinking that has come before you? Seneca, on the same subject, wrote, “Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides.”
- How do you value your time? We can make more money; we can't make more time.
- Charlie Munger, voracious reader, billionaire, and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, once commented: “In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero.”

# Mental Models: The Best Way to Make Intelligent Decisions (113 Models Explained)
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/)

- Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.
- Mental model approach: you must have a large number of them, and they must be fundamentally lasting ideas.
- Without the right training, most minds take the wrong approach: "Which ideas do I already love and know deeply, and how can I apply them to the situation at hand?"
- "To the man with only a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail."

## General Thinking Tools

- ***The Map is not the Territory.*** The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect, because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us.
- ***Circle of Competence.*** Understand that you have things that you don't understand. When you are honesty about where your knowledge is lacking, you know where you
- ***First Principles Thinking.*** Separate the underlying facts from any assumptions based on them.
- ***Thought Experiment.***
- ***Second-Order Thinking.*** About thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically. It requires us to not only consider our actions and their immediate consequences, but the subsequent effects of those actions as well.
- ***Probabilistic Thinking.*** Things we are trying to estimate are based on probabilities and likelihoods.
- ***Inversion.***
- ***Occam's Razor.*** Simple explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones. Instead of wasting your time trying to disprove complex scenarios, you can make decisions more confidently by basing them on the explanation that has the fewest moving parts.
- ***Hanlon's Razor.*** Do not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. In a complex world, using this model helps us avoid paranoia and ideology. By not generally assuming that bad results are the fault of a bad actor, we look for options instead of missing opportunities.

## Numeracy

- ***Permutations and Combinations.***
- ***Algebraic Equivalence.***
- ***Randomness.*** We are "fooled" by random effects when we attribute causality to things that are actually outside of our control.
- ***Stochastic Processes.*** A random process that encompasses a wide variety of processes in which the movement of an individual variable can be impossible to predict but can be thought through probabilistically. For example, it's not possible to predict stock prices on a day-to-day basis, but we can describe the probability of various distributions of their movements over time.
- ***Compounding.*** The time value of money, which underlies all of modern finance.
- ***Multiplying by Zero.*** A failure in one important area can negate great effort in all other areas.
- ***Churn.*** Every year, customers are lost and must be replaced.
- ***Law of Large Numbers.***
- ***Bell Curve/Normal Distribution.***
- ***Power Law.***
- ***Fat-Tailed Processes (Extremistan).*** A process can look like a normal distribution but have a large "tail", meaning that outliers are far more likely than they are in an actual normal distribution. Much of the human social world is said to be fat-tailed rather than normally distributed.
- ***Bayesian Updating.*** A method of thought where one takes into account all prior relevant probabilities and then incrementally updates them as newer information arrives. Ex: we must use prior odds and new information in combination to arrive at our best decisions.
- ***Regression to the Mean.*** Ex: getting fooled by a patient improving spontaneously around the same time they begin taking a herbal remedy.
- ***Order of Magnitude.*** 1 million is a LONG way from 1 billion.

## Systems

- ***Scale.*** Properties tend to change when you scale them up or down.
- ***Law of Diminishing Returns.***
- ***Pareto Principle.***
- ***Homeostasis.*** A change in A is often brought back into line by an opposite change in B to maintain the balance of the system. Ex: company culture.
- ***Chaos Dynamics/Butterfly Effect.*** Some aspects of physical systems as well as social systems are fundamentally unpredictable.
- ***Preferential Attachment.*** The current leader is given more of the reward than the laggards.
- ***Emergence.*** Higher-level behavior tends to emerge from the interaction of lower-order components. Emergent behavior cannot be predicted from simply studying the component parts.
- ***Irreducibility.*** Ex: You can't get several women pregnant to reduce the amount of time needed to have one child.
- ***Tragedy of the Commons.*** When a common resource is shared, with no individual responsible for the well-being of the resources, it will tend to be depleted over time. The Tragedy is reducible to incentives: unless people collaborate, each individual derives more personal benefit than the cost that he or she incurs, and therefore depletes the resource for fear of missing out.
- ***Gresham's Law.*** In a system of circulating currency, forged currency will tend to drive out real currency, as real currency is hoarded and forged currency is spent.
- ***Algorithms.***
- ***Fragility, Robustness, Antifragility.***
- ***Backup Systems/Redundancy.***
- ***Margin of Safety.***
- ***Criticality.*** Ex: boiling water.
- ***Network Effects.***
- ***Black Swan.*** A rare and highly consequential event that is invisible to a given observer ahead of time.  It is a result of applied epistemology: If you have seen only white swans, you cannot categorically state that there are no black swans, but the inverse is not true: seeing one black swan is enough for you to state that there are black swans. Black Swan events are necessarily unpredictable to the observer (as Taleb likes to say, Thanksgiving is a Black Swan for the turkey, not the butcher) and thus must be dealt with by addressing the fragility-robustness-antifragility spectrum rather than through better methods of prediction.
- ***Via Negativa (Omission/Removal/Avoidance of Harm).*** In many systems, improvement can be a result of removing bad elements rather than adding good elements. First, do no harm. Ex: in a group of children behaving badly, removal of the instigator is often much more effective than any form of punishment meted out to the whole group.
- ***Lindy Effect.*** The life expectancy of a non-perishable object or idea is related to its current lifespan. If an idea or object has lasted for X number of years, it would be expected to last another X years. Ex: classic texts.
- ***Renormalization Group.*** A small number of stubborn individuals can have a disproportionate impact if those around them follow suit on increasingly large scales.
- ***Spring-loading.*** A system is spring-loaded if it is coiled in a certain direction, positive or negative.
- ***Complex Adaptive Systems.*** A system that can understand itself and change based on that understanding.

## Physical World

- ***The Laws of Thermodynamics.*** The laws cannot be escaped and underlie the physical world. Useful energy is constantly being lost, and energy cannot be created or destroyed.
- ***Reciprocity.*** If I push on a wall, that wall pushes back with equivalent force.
- ***Velocity.*** Moving two steps forward and then two steps back means you move at a certain speed but no velocity.
- ***Relativity.*** An observer cannot truly understand a system of which he himself is a part. A man inside an airplane does not feel like he is experiencing movement, but an outside observer can see that movement is occurring.
- ***Activation Energy.*** Need a level of energy to get a reaction started.
- ***Catalysts.*** Either kick-starts or maintains a chemical reaction, but it isn't itself a reactant.
- ***Leverage.***
- ***Inertia.***
- ***Alloying.*** We can combine elements to create new substances.

## The Biological World

- ***Incentives.*** Humans are included and are particularly great examples of the incentive-driven nature of biology; however, humans are complicated in that their incentives can be hidden or intangible. The rule of life is to repeat what works and has been rewarded.
- ***Cooperation.***
- ***Tendency to Minimize Energy Output.***
- ***Adaptation.***
- ***Evolution by Natural Selection.***
- ***The Red Queen.*** When a species evolves an advantageous adaptation, a competing species must respond in kind or fail as a species. Standing pat can mean falling behind.
  - [Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/)
  - Not all animals evolve at the same rate.
  - We invest significantly in new product development and content.
  - We are not in the business of edutainment, but in providing better outcomes.
  - We try to spend our mental resources working on things that won't change next week.
  - We recognize how the world works.
  - At some point, frogs evolve stickier tongues, and flies evolve more slippery bodies.
- ***Replication.***
- ***Hierarchical Instincts.***
- ***Self-Preservation Instincts.***
- ***Simple Physiological Reward-Seeking.*** Reward-seeking is an effective survival-promoting technique on average. However, those same pleasure receptors can be co-opted to cause destructive behavior, as with drug abuse.
- ***Exaptation.*** A trait developed for one purpose that is later used for another purpose.
- ***Extinction.***
- ***Ecosystems.***
- ***Nichs.***
- ***Dunbar's Number.***

## Human Nature & Judgment

- ***Trust.*** The modern world operates on trust.
- ***Bias from incentives.*** Ex: a salesman might truly believe his product will improve the lives of its users. That he sells his product causes a very real bias in his own thinking.
- ***Pavlovian Association.*** Animals can respond not just to direct incentives but also to associated objects.
- ***Tendency to Feel Envy and Jealousy.*** This drives otherwise irrational behavior. Systems must be aware of envy effects.
- ***Tendency to Distort Due to Liking or Disliking.*** Based on past association, stereotyping, ideology, genetic influence, or direct experience, humans have a tendency to distort their thinking in favor of people or things that they like and against people or things they dislike. This tendency leads to overrating the things we like and underrating or broadly categorizing things we dislike, often missing crucial nuances in the process.
- ***Denial.***
- ***Availability Heuristic.*** We recall what is salient, important, frequent, and recent.
- ***Representativeness Heuristic.***
  - Failure to Account for Base Rates: An unconscious failure to look at past odds in determining current or future behavior.
  - Tendency to Stereotype.
  - Failure to see False Conjunctions. Students choose more vividly described individuals as more likely to fit in a predefined category than those with a broader, more inclusive, but less vivid descriptions.
- ***Social Proof.***
- ***Narrative Instinct.***
- ***Curiosity Instinct.***
- ***Language Instinct.***
- ***First Conclusion Bias.*** As Charlie Munger famously pointed out, the mind works a bit like a sperm and egg: the first idea gets in and then the mind shuts. Like many other tendencies, this is probably an energy-saving device. Our tendency to settle on first conclusions leads us to accept many erroneous results and cease asking questions; it can be countered with some simple and useful mental routines.
- ***Tendency to Overgeneralize from Small Samples.***
- ***Relative Satisfaction/Misery Tendencies.*** Happiness is related to the state of the person relative to either their past or their peers, not absolute.
- ***Commitment and Consistency Bias.*** People who often change their conclusions are often distrusted.
- ***Hindsight Bias.*** "We knew it all along." Lol.
- ***Sensitivity to Fairness.***
- ***Tendency to Overestimate Consistency of Behavior (Fundamental Attribution Error).*** We tend to over-ascribe the behavior of others to "THEIR INNATE TRAITS", and in practice this assumption is consistently demonstrated to be wrong. We are surprised when other people do not act in accordance with the innate traits we've endowed them with.
- ***Influence of Authority.***
- ***Influence of Stress.***
- ***Survivorship bias.***
- ***Tendency to Want to Do Something.***
- ***Falisification/Confirmation Bias.***
  - What a man wishes, he also believes.
  - The scientific process – including hypothesis generation, blind testing when needed, and objective statistical rigor – is designed to root out precisely the opposite, which is why it works so well when followed.
  - A method is termed scientific if it can be stated in such a way that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false.
  - Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being un-falsifiable – as with astrology, we are unable to prove them either correct or incorrect because the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated.

## Microeconomics & Strategy

- ***Opportunity Costs.***
- ***Creative Destruction.*** Motivated by personal incentives (including but not limited to financial profit), entrepreneurs will push to best one another in a never-ending game of creative one-upmanship, in the process destroying old ideas and replacing them with newer technology. Beware getting left behind.
- ***Comparative Advantage.*** If it has the opportunity to trade, an entity gives up free gains in productivity by not focusing on what it does best.
- ***Specialization.*** Rather than having a group of workers each producing an entire item from start to finish, Smith explained that it’s usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production.
- ***Seizing the Middle.*** In chess, the winning strategy is usually to seize control of the middle of the board, so as to maximize the potential moves that can be made and control the movement of the maximal number of pieces.
- ***Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights.***
- ***Double-Entry Bookkeeping.***
- ***Utility.***
- ***Bottlenecks.***
- ***Prisoner's Dilemma.***
- ***Bribery.*** Given the chance, it is often easier to pay a certain agent to look the other way than to follow the rules.
- ***Arbitrage.*** Given two markets selling an identical good, an arbitrage exists if the good can profitably be bought in one market and sold at a profit in the other. This model is simple on its face, but can present itself in disguised forms: The only gas station in a 50-mile radius is also an arbitrage as it can buy gasoline and sell it at the desired profit (temporarily) without interference. Nearly all arbitrage situations eventually disappear as they are discovered and exploited.
- ***Supply and Demand.***
- ***Scarcity.***
- ***Mr. Market.*** Markets are like a moody neighbor. Your job as an investor is to take advantage of him in his bad/good moods.

## Military and War

- ***Seeing the Front.*** Leaders of any organization can generally benefit from seeing the front, as not only does it provide firsthand information, but it also tends to improve the quality of secondhand information.
- ***Asymmetric Warfare.*** One side plays by different rules due to circumstance. Ex: terrorism.
- ***Two-Front War.***
- ***Counter-insurgency.***
- ***Mutually Assured Destruction.***

# The Nerds Were Right. Math Makes Life Beautiful.
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2018/05/math-life-beautiful/)

- What's scary is approaching someone for a data or a job. Rejection sucks. Most men go with the "risk the feeling of rejection" and women go for the "throw a lot of eye contact".
- Gale-Shapley matching: If you put yourself out there and start at the top of the list, then work your way down, you'll always end up with the best possible person who'll have you. If you sit around and wait for people to talk to you, you'll end up with the least bad person who approaches you.
- ***The chances of ending up with what you want dramatically increase if you make the first move. Aim high, and aim frequently.***
- Being curious about the world helps us find solutions to problems by bringing new knowledge to bear on old challenges.

# The Terror of Totalitarianism Explained
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2018/03/hannah-arendt-totalitarianism/)

- In many modern democracies, we can see evidence of indifference and pervasive feelings of helplessness. There is low voter turnout and an assumption that things will be the way they are no matter what an individual does.
- There is pent-up energy in apathy. The desire to be more than indifferent: what totalitarian movements manipulate, until the individual is totally subsumed.
- *It is simple to isolate people who already feel isolated. When you feel disconnected from the system, whether you believe that neither your vote nor your opinion matters, it's not a huge leap to feel that your very self has no importance.*
- Totalitarianism demands total, unrestricted, unconditional, and unalterable loyalty of the individual member. *Such loyalty can be expected only from the completely isolated human being, who without any social ties to family, friends, comrades, derives his sense of having a place in the world only from his belonging to a movement.*

## Politics and Propaganda

- Totalitarianism does not have an end goal in the usual political sense. *Its only real goal is to perpetuate its own existence.*
  - Fear is a requirement. Fear is what keeps the movement going.
  - Lies and falsehoods can eventually be established as unquestioned facts, that man may be free to change his own past at will, and that the difference between truth and falsehood may cease to be objective.
  - The problem today: opinions are being given the same weight as facts.
- The goal is not the welfare of the sate, nor economic prosperity or social advancement.
  - Independent thinkers are threats, so they are among the first to be purged.
  - Totalitarianism in power is about keeping itself in power. By preemptively removing large groups of power, the system neutralizes all those who might question it.
- *Because they pay no attention to actually governing, they are not likely to be sustainable in the long run.*

# Second-Order Thinking
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2016/04/second-level-thinking/)

- First-order thinkers look for things that are simple, easy, and defensible. They fail to realize that they are dealing with complex systems and they might mistake cause-and-effect relationships. They are incapable of thinking in terms of second and subsequent steps. And they are unaware of the need to think in terms of second steps.
- First-level thinkers think in the same way other first-level thinkers do, and they usually reach the same conclusions. ***But extraordinary performance comes from being different.*** Of course, below-average performance comes from being, different, too.
- The road to out-thinking people doesn't come from first-order thinking, but from second-order thinking.
- The ability to risk looking like an idiot in the short term is necessary for being different. If you look like everyone else, you never look like a fool, but you will also never outperform everyone else.

# Warren Buffett: The Three Things I Look For in a Person
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2013/05/warren-buffett-the-three-things-i-look-for-in-a-person/)

- Useful qualities to have: generosity, kindness, integrity.
- These qualities are choices people make.
- Intelligence, energy, and integrity.

# The Buffett Formula: Going to Bed Smarter Than you Woke Up
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2013/05/the-buffett-formula-how-to-get-smarter/)

- They are smart, and they keep getting smarter.
- "I just sit in my office and read all day."
- They didn't work in the same office, because they would have wanted to talk all the time, leaving no time for reading.
- There are opportunity costs for everything you do. You can check wherever, read news, etc. Or you can dedicate some time to improve yourself.

# Hunter S. Thompson’s Letter on Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/)

- To give advice to a man implies something very close to egomania. To presume that you can point a man to the right and ultimate goal is something only a fool would take upon himself.
- Perspectives change. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes.
- We do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors, we strive to be ourselves.
- Make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal.
- Choose a path which lets your abilities function at maximum ability towards the gratification of your desires.
- If you can't find purpose in the eight paths before you, find the ninth path.

# The Difference Between Amateurs and Professionals
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/)

- Professionals understand that the initial achievement is just the beginning.
- Professionals have a process, not a goal.
- Professionals understand their circles of competence.
- Professionals know they have weak spots and seek out thoughtful criticism.
- Professionals value consistency, not isolated performances.
- Professionals know what improves the odds of achieving good outcomes.
- Professionals know that what happens in practice happens in games.
- Professionals focus on getting the best outcome.
- Professionals understand when good outcomes are the result of luck.
- Professionals focus on making everyone better.
- Professionals make decisions as individuals and accept responsibility.
- Professionals realize that the first idea is rarely the best idea.
- Professionals think in probabilities.
- Professionals know their probability of having the best idea is low.
- Professionals know reality is what's true.
- Professionals see disagreements as opportunities to learn.

# The Art of Having an Informed Opinion
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2017/10/opinions-on-everything/)

- The world will do most of the work for you, provided you cooperate with it by identifying how it really works and aligning those realities.
- People who have opinions about everything barf so much noise that it's hard to find the signal.
- ***The world never tells you that you're wrong; it only gives you outcomes.***
  - When an outcome is not what you want to be, things get tough. You can ignore the result and continue to think that you're right. This protects your ego.
  - People who can't change their minds never more forward.
  - If you insist on having an opinion, carry a mental scorecard. Use a decision journal.

# The Single Best Interview Question You Can Ask
[Reference](https://www.fs.blog/2015/11/the-single-best-interview-question-you-can-ask/)

- "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"
- Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.
- The future is the set of all moments yet to come.
- Horizontal progress: copying things that work. Globalization.
- Vertical progress: harder to imagine because it requires doing something nobody else has ever done. Technology.
- Thiel's answer: "My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more. Without technological change, if China doubles its energy production over the next two decades, it will also double its air pollution. If every one of India’s hundreds of millions of households were to live the way Americans already do— using only today’s tools— the result would be environmentally catastrophic. Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not riches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable."
