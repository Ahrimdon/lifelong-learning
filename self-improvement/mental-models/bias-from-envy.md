# Mental Model: Bias from Envy and Jealousy

- We are not equal. Not biologically, not culturally.
- Some are from flawed governing systems, and some are due to luck.
- Some are born healthier, prettier, and smarter than others, and some will encounter opportunities to become extremely wealthy, and some will be born at the right place and time.
- It is built into the human condition, from birth.
- Seneca: "Content with his lot, whatever it be, without wishing for what he has not."

## The Two Types of Envy

- Good type: The feeling of inferiority that motivates a person to improve herself. Framing the success of others as a learning opportunity for themselves.
- Malicious envy: Take good things away from others. *People hate those who make them feel their own inferiority. The relation between envy and hate is pretty close, if you observe the world closely.*
- A belief in your own shortcomings plants the motivation for improvement.
- The belief that you have been treated unfairly has the opposite effect, feelings of anger and resentment.
- *We experience envy when the quality we feel inferior about threatens our self-concept.* We don't feel envious about javelin throwers, because javelin throwing isn't a part of our self-concept. Thus, envy of others is always a reflection of something we feel about ourselves. We're not rich enough, smart enough, beautiful enough, possessions, attention, success.

## Jealousy

- Anxious insecurity that follows the perception of threat to a relationship which provides important attention.
- Self, partner, and the rival. We like to think of ourselves as sexually attractive, funny, or otherwise worthy persons.
- Humans are deeply social creatures: how we feel about ourselves has to do with our interactions with others. There are not personality traits in a vacuum.
- Sibling rivalry: occurs because the most important relationship for a child is that with his parents.
- *Envy: the loss comes from our self-appraisal, in jealousy it comes from the appraisal of others.*

## Dealing with Envy?

- Focus on the differences, rather than the similarities.
- Shape that malicious envy into a drive to improve and learn.
- Just repetitively deny it. Remind yourself that the world is not fair and the success of others does not reflect on you and does not take away from you.
- *The best way to avoid envy is to deserve the success you get.*
