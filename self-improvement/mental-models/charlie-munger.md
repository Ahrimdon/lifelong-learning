# Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger: Avoid these 5 things that ‘guarantee’ a life of misery

- *Letting addiction take over.*
- *Feeling resentful.* Write the names of all the people who wrong you on a piece of paper and place them in a drawer. From time to time, you can know that the world had taken your enemies down without your assistance.
- *Being unreliable.*
- *Letting life knock you down.* If you refuse to get back up after facing an adverse situation, you will have a miserable life. Bounce back, regardless of the situation that you're faced with.
- *Refusing to learn from past mistakes.* Become as educated as you possibly can.

# Charlie Munger: How to Get Smarter by Using Mental Models
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/charlie-munger-how-to-get-smarter-by-using-mental-models-4659fe6d53db)

- He and Buffett: learning machines. They collect mental models about how the world works, and they use this collection to attack problems in a variety of ways before arriving at a solution.
- Pareto Principle: A small number of key variables have a greater impact on the result that all of the rest of the variables combined.
- Remove blind spots to improve problem solving. It's better to limit downside by avoiding mistakes than it is to be brilliant. No matter how great you are, you will eventually run out of luck.
- Behavioral economics: we don't understand the world rationally. We all have our biases, and these biases are more powerful than we think.
- See reality clearly through a multi-disciplinary lens. Multiple models in multiple fields.

- *Nothing has served me better in my long life than continuous learning. I went through life constantly practicing (because if you don’t practice it, you lose it) the multi-disciplinary approach and I can’t tell you what that’s done for me. It’s made life more fun, it’s made me more constructive, its made me more helpful to others, its made me enormously rich. You name it, that attitude really helps.*
- Solving things:
  - Simplify the problem
  - Use numerical fluency
  - Invert the problem
  - Apply basic knowledge

- ***What is elementary, worldly wisdom? Well, the first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.***
- And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That's why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don't have enough models in their heads. So you've got to have models across a fair array of disciplines.
- You may say, "My God, this is already getting way too tough." But, fortunately, it isn't that tough—because 80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.
- Math: numbers, quantities, compound interest, statistics.
- Decision tree theory.
- *By and large, as it works out, people can't naturally and automatically do this. If you understand elementary psychology, the reason they can't is really quite simple: The basic neural network of the brain is there through broad genetic and cultural evolution. And it's not Fermat/Pascal. It uses a very crude, shortcut-type of approximation.*
  - Decision trees, permutations, combinations.
- *Accounting, double-entry bookkeeping.*

- The Braun Company?
  - If you tell somebody to do something, and you didn't tell him why, you could get fired. And you would get fired if you did it twice.
  - This is important because people will definitely understand things better if you tell them why. Even if they don't understand your reason, they'll be more likely to comply.

- *Which models are most reliable? Those from hard science and engineering.*
  - You don't need to be super deep in statistics knowledge, but at least know what a Gaussian or normal distribution looks like.
  - Engineering and Physics: Backup systems. Breakpoints. Critical mass. Cost-benefit analysis.
  - Biology: our genetic makeup.
  - Your brain has a shortage of circuitry and it takes a lot of automatic shortcuts. This is where you can get misled.

- *The elementary part of psychology: misjudgment.*
  - What are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered?
  - What are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things?
  - Rationality: evaluate the real interests, the real probabilities. Evaluate the psychological factors that can cause subconscious conclusions.

- *Microeconomics.*
  -  People who narrowly specialize can get really good at occupying some little niche. People who specialize in the business world find good economics that they wouldn't get any other way.
  - Advantage of scale. Just doing something complicated in more and more volume enables human beings to do it more and more efficiently.
  - TV advertising, early days: for big companies, which made them get a big tail wind.
  - Wrigley, simply by being so well-known, has an advantage of scale/informational advantage.
  - Social proof. "Why shouldn't I just follow them?"
  - *In business, the very nature of things is to cascade towards the overwhelming dominance of one firm.* Ex: newspapers in cities.
  - Narrowcast: scaling down and intensifying = higher profit margins.
  - When you get bigger, you get the bureaucracy. And with the bureaucracy comes the territoriality, which is grounded in human nature.
  - In a bureaucracy, you think the work is done when it goes out of your in-basket into somebody else's in-basket.
  - The curse of scale: it leads to big, dumb, bureaucracy. The incentives become really awful.

- *Pavlovian association.*
  - If people tell you what you really don't want to hear, then you will almost always have a reaction of antipathy.
  - This can lead you to a cocoon of unreality.
- *So life is an everlasting battle between those two forces—to get these advantages of scale on one side and a tendency to get a lot like the U.S. Agriculture Department on the other side—where they just sit around and so forth.* I don't know exactly what they do. However, I do know that they do very little useful work.
- Chain stores: you can have a lot of little laboratories out there where you can conduct experiments and specialization.
  - Walmart: Playing the chain store game harder and better than anyone else. Walton invented practically nothing. But he copied everything anybody else ever did that was smart—and he did it with more fanaticism and better employee manipulation. So he just blew right by them all.
  - Walton, being as shrewd as he was, basically broke other small town merchants in the early days. With his more efficient system, he might not have been able to tackle some titan head-on at the time. But with his better system, he could destroy those small town merchants. And he went around doing it time after time after time. Then, as he got bigger, he started destroying the big boys.
- *You can say, "Is this a nice way to behave?" Well, capitalism is a pretty brutal place. But I personally think that the world is better for having Walmart. I mean you can idealize small town life. But I've spent a fair amount of time in small towns. And let me tell you you shouldn't get too idealistic about all those businesses he destroyed.*

- Competition
  - Airline seats: competition.
  - Cereal: profitable. Brand identity factor + less crazy about fighting for market share.

- *The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it's going to kill you.* And most people do not get this straight in their heads. But a fellow like Buffett does.
  - Ex: new loom for textiles. Buffett: If it worked, then they should close the business. He knew that the productivity increases would go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles, not the owners.
  - It's not that the machines weren't better, it's just that the savings didn't go to you.
- Competitive destruction: buggy whip → horseless carriage.
  - Cash register: advantages was that it became harder for the employees to steal.
  - He had the best distribution system, the biggest collection of patents, the best of everything.
  - Circle of competence: we avoid the high-tech sector. So figure out where your aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. Figure out where you've got an edge.

- Given those mathematics, is it possible to beat the horses only using one's intelligence? Intelligence should give some edge, because lots of people who don't know anything go out and bet lucky numbers and so forth. *Therefore, somebody who really thinks about nothing but horse performance and is shrewd and mathematical could have a very considerable edge, in the absence of the frictional cost caused by the house take.*
  - It's not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time. But it is given to human beings who work hard at it—who look and sift the world for a mispriced be—that they can occasionally find one.
  - *And the wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don't. It's just that simple.*
  - The way to win is to work, work, work, work and hope to have a few insights.
- ***When Warren lectures at business schools, he says, "I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only 20 slots in it so that you had 20 punches—representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once you'd punched through the card, you couldn't make any more investments at all."***
  - He says, "Under those rules, you'd really think carefully about what you did and you'd be forced to load up on what you'd really thought about. So you'd do so much better."
  - To me, it's obvious that the winner has to bet very selectively. It's been obvious to me since very early in life. I don't know why it's not obvious to very many other people.

- Most investment managers are in a game where the clients expect them to know a lot about a lot of things. We didn't have any clients who could fire us at Berkshire Hathaway. So we didn't have to be governed by any such construct. And we came to this notion of finding a mispriced bet and loading up when we were very confident that we were right. So we're way less diversified. And I think our system is miles better.

- *In investment management today, everybody wants not only to win, but to have a yearly outcome path that never diverges very much from a standard path except on the upside. Well, that is a very artificial, crazy construct.*
  - That is really hobbling yourself. But from the viewpoint of a rational consumer, the whole system's "bonkers" and draws a lot of talented people into socially useless activity.
  - *And it makes sense to load up on the very few good insights you have instead of pretending to know everything about everything at all times. You're much more likely to do well if you start out to do something feasible instead of something that isn't feasible.*
  - Occasionally, you'll find a human being who's so talented that he can do things that ordinary skilled mortals can't. These people do come along—and in many cases, they're not all that hard to identify.
  - *However, averaged out, betting on the quality of a business is better than betting on the quality of management. In other words, if you have to choose one, bet on the business momentum, not the brilliance of the manager.*

- Let me mention another model. Of course, Gillette and Coke make fairly lowpriced items and have a tremendous marketing advantage all over the world.
  - And in Gillette's case, they keep surfing along new technology which is fairly simple by the standards of microchips. But it's hard for competitors to do.
  - So they've been able to stay constantly near the edge of improvements in shaving. There are whole countries where Gillette has more than 90% of the shaving market.

- GEICO is a very interesting model. It's another one of the 100 or so models you ought to have in your head.
  - They look at this mess. And they figure out if there's anything sound left that can live on its own if they cut away everything else. And if they find anything sound, they just cut away everything else. Of course, if that doesn't work, they liquidate the business. But it frequently does work.

- I think a select few—a small percentage of the investment managers—can deliver value added. But I don't think brilliance alone is enough to do it. I think that you have to have a little of this discipline of calling your shots and loading up—you want to maximize your chances of becoming one who provides above average real returns for clients over the long pull.
