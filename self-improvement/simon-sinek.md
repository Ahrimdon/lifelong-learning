## ONE OF THE BEST SPEECHES EVER by Simon Sinek (So Inspiring!)
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SPfF0JbFb8)

- Entitled is the big one re: millenials.
- We want to work in a place with purpose, we want to make an impact, and we want free food/bean bags.
- But we give them all those things but they are still not happy, there is a missing piece.
- Parenting, technology, impatience, environment.
- Failed parenting strategies: They were told they were special, and they got participation medals. When they figure out that in the real world, you can't just have it if you want it, you have lower self-esteem.
- Facebook: You put filters on things. There is actually very little toughness and most people don't figure it out.
- An entire generation that is addicted to dopamine via Facebook.
- Adolescents are when they first figure out that they can relieve stress through drinking.
-No deep meaningful relationships, and stressed out.
- Nothing wrong about social media but always in moderation. If you cannot put the phone away, then you are addicted.
- Impatience: instant gratification, for everything except job satisfaction and meaningful relationships. You don't have an app for that.
- All of the hard things take time.
- Environment: caring more about the year of the kid, not about the life time.
- Companies: if these kids didn't have the best parents, it's our job to teach them the thing.
- Meetings: no cell phones in conference rooms.
- Ideas happen when our minds wander and think about things.

## Why good leaders make you feel safe | Simon Sinek

- Captain Swenson. He kissed the guy who he saved.
- In the military, they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain.
- In business, we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so we may gain.
- Are they just better people?
- I think it is just the environment.
- Why did you do it? Because they would have done the same for me.
- The problem is that trust and cooperation are feelings. You can't just ask a person to trust them and you can't just ask them to cooperate with each other.
- Benefits of trust: we are sure that we can sleep at night because we know that someone is guarding us.
- "Sir if I don't follow the rules, I will
- You have to not fear your leaders. If we feel safe in the organization, we will naturally combine our talents and strengths.
- Great leaders want to provide their people opportunity, education, discipline, self-confidence, and give them opportunities to try and fail so they can achieve more than we can imagine for ourselves.
- If you had hard times in our family, we would not consider laying off our children.
- Company: You cannot get fired for performance issues. They will coach you and they will support you.
- The hatred with banking CEOs: it's not the numbers, it's because they have violated leadership because they allowed their people to be sacrificed to serve their interests.
- Great leaders would not sacrifice people to save the numbers, they will sacrifice the numbers to save the people.
- "Better that all of us suffer a little than a few of us suffer a lot."
- There are people who are authorities, and there are people who are leaders. Leaders take care of other people. Authorities are people that you just obey.
- We call them leaders because they take risks so others may gain.
- The organization you would want to work in: "because they would do the same for me."
