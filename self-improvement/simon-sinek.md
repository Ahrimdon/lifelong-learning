## ONE OF THE BEST SPEECHES EVER by Simon Sinek (So Inspiring!)
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SPfF0JbFb8)

- Entitled is the big one re: millenials.
- We want to work in a place with purpose, we want to make an impact, and we want free food/bean bags.
- But we give them all those things but they are still not happy, there is a missing piece.
- Parenting, technology, impatience, environment.
- Failed parenting strategies: They were told they were special, and they got participation medals. When they figure out that in the real world, you can't just have it if you want it, you have lower self-esteem.
- Facebook: You put filters on things. There is actually very little toughness and most people don't figure it out.
- An entire generation that is addicted to dopamine via Facebook.
- Adolescents are when they first figure out that they can relieve stress through drinking.
-No deep meaningful relationships, and stressed out.
- Nothing wrong about social media but always in moderation. If you cannot put the phone away, then you are addicted.
- Impatience: instant gratification, for everything except job satisfaction and meaningful relationships. You don't have an app for that.
- All of the hard things take time.
- Environment: caring more about the year of the kid, not about the life time.
- Companies: if these kids didn't have the best parents, it's our job to teach them the thing.
- Meetings: no cell phones in conference rooms.
- Ideas happen when our minds wander and think about things.
