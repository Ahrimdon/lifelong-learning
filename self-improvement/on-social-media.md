- Social media: "My Life > Your Life".
- Why did I post this? More often than not, the answer to that question will be because "I wanted to put forth a version of myself that, although isn't real, is pretty admired by society."
  - Today, we're spending more time talking about our goals and endeavours on Facebook than actually attempting to accomplish them.
  - We're going to great heights like attempting to take selfies from dangerous places just so we could get the most number of likes.
  - We're spending hours debating with other people by commenting on controversial posts instead of focusing on what's in our control and doing our job.

So why is this not okay?

- *Comparing impedes progress.* Social Comparison Theory: This theory states that we determine our own social and personal value based on how other people in our lives are doing. To become better versions of ourselves, what we really need is a free afternoon, a blank page and a pen to reflect and evaluate our progress.
- *It (incorrectly) changes our definition of success.* "Transformation" stories--these are inspiring, but the most important part is THE PROCESS. We just see the before and after picture.
  - We don't see the process, which to some extent, changes our definition of success and makes us impatient. If we saw the process, we'd see reality--the number of times that person has failed, how they motivated themselves when things weren't looking good, how many times they had to change the way they do things, the frustration, the tears, the anger--everything.
  - We'd see a type of change bigger than just pictures--we'd see a change in character.
- *It negatively impacts our self-esteem.* Beach Instagram pics: It would show everyone how "wonderful" my life is even when in reality, it's not.
  - So, if a friend who's going through a tough time would see that, it would negatively impact their self esteem. It would make them compare their life to mine, giving them less headspace to figure out their own.
  - The point isn't to be a social media therapist. No. It’s to say the truth and acknowledge that at the end of the day, we’re all, to some extent, broken. And that life is pretty unfair.

### We're all Broken

- We're all lonely.
- Each and every post for us serves as a ray of hope. We secretly hope that `#selfie` post will make someone reach out to us and tell us how much we matter, or that `#transformation` story will help us gain more friends so we feel less alone.
- We may not fully understand someone in and out, but we can try--what is life but not dancing around imperfections?
- So, the next time you're on vacation and post a beach photo, ask yourself if you're truly happy or, are wondering why on earth you still feel like shit after coming to such a beautiful place. And, instead of letting the number of hearts dictate your happiness, reach out to a friend.

### How can we make our relationship with social media better:

- *Question your content.*
  - *Why do I feel the need to post this?* Do you post because you feel a need to get a number of likes (maybe you're insecure?), or you're bored all the time (time to start a new habit)?
  - *What is the purpose of this post?* This acts as a harsh filter, so you can be mindful about the content you post by making your intentions clear. Are you trying to inspire, be kind, and most of all, are you speaking the truth?
  - *How can I make this post more meaningful and real?* By asking ourselves that question, we're essentially trying to create something out of our impulses. Would a post on you mom's wall on Facebook really help her? Does the entire world really need to know? Instead, think about a meaningful present.
    - Feel like shit and want to post something for attention? How about you reach out to a friend? Want to tag an old friend and write about how you miss them? Instead of tagging them, go get coffee with them and have a real conversation.
- *Monitor your usage.*
  - Record the number of times you check social media, and in total, how much time you spend doing it. They idea here is to try to get some kind of insight as to why we do what we do. And then, come up with constructive solutions to get better.
    - Do you check Facebook to see if you've gotten another like?
    - DO you post on Instagram way too often?
    - Whenever you're bored, do you just go check Twitter?
    - When something goes wrong, is your first impulse to go down your news feed?
  - Most of us choose to get lost in a world that isn't even a world. We choose to check our phones rather than talk to the person beside us. We choose to take photos instead of being in the present. The problem is that we lose our touch with the present moment, with what is going on right NOW.
  - Social media helps us instantly disconnect from reality, from ourselves and our values.
  - Awareness grants us clarity and helps drive positive change.
- *Make a social media schedule.*
  - Hopefully, this helps us check in with the world at certain times of the day, once we've done our job and given time to things that matter most to us.
  - This makes social media a part of your life, not your life.

### Over To You

- The idea isn't to completely get rid of all modern communicative methods. No, not at all. Instead, it’s to see social media as what it is- a tool. And, to use this tool, not to create a double life, but, to help assist the life you’re currently living.

- How can this tool assist your life?
  - Reach out to a friend when you need someone to listen
  - Try to be truthful about your posts, remember- we’re all broken at the end of the day
  - If you’re an artist, share your work (don’t talk about it- do it and share it)
