- The possibility for greatness and embarrassment both exist in the same space. If you're not willing to be embarrassed, you're probably not willing to be great.

  - Anytime after 9:17 pm.
  - Struggling with being "blessed with singleness".

  - The first tearful "it's over".
  - The real breakup.
- Don't sit at your computer perched like a Roman gargoyle. Bust out before your butt does.
