[Reference](https://themission.co/5-things-i-had-to-give-up-to-be-successful-a7b076f3d859)

- There is an opportunity cost to everything worthwhile in life. Doctor: Give up your early 20s and 10 years of your life for school and training.
- Entrepreneur: Time, feeling of certainty/security that come with a steady paycheck.
- Athlete: Decades of training, deliberate practice.
- Kids: Ability to take risks, financial freedom.
- Traveling the world: Familiarity, friends, family, and a sense of belonging and community.
- Abs: Food they loved.

#### Other People's Definition of Success

- *Giving up other people's definition of success is incredibly liberating and ultimately leads to the fullest expression of who you are and what matters to you.* It's not a one-time thing. It's a daily habit of comparing less and creating more.
- Other people aren't going to live with the consequences of the choices you've made. So why would you live your life according to their definition of success?-

#### Financial Security

- I figured building a body of work would be far more valuable than to keep adding to my resume of failures.

#### Most of my 30s

- Read hundreds of books, wrote 3 books, planned a conference, produced an animated series, interviewed more than 600 people.
- Don't just increase your earnings, increase your earning potential.
- Time is the most valuable asset at your disposal.
- If you have one hour a day for uninterrupted creation time, you'll be amazed by what you're capable of.

#### Fear of Judgment

- It was embarrassing to still be living at home and not making much money.
- The fear of being judged keeps so many of us from taking a shot at our most ambitious dreams.
- The approval of people who won't consume my things is essentially meaningless.
- Once you give up your fear of judgment, your ability to work changes quite drastically. You focus on the process, not the prize, and you start to see progress towards the life you want to live.

#### Any Baggage Related to the Past

- The past can never be changed.
- "Just because someone screwed up your past, it doesn't mean you should give them permission to screw up your future."
- You have to sacrifice something that you value less than whatever it is you ultimately want.
