# Cities

## First Impressions

- Venice: high tourist visits but decreasing population.

## How Did It Begin?

- India, Mesopotamia, China, Central America, Egypt, Peru: cities emerged but not at the same time, some 1000 years after the other.
- Why? Agriculture became viable, and people began living in settled communities, with some richer than others. Successful farmers gathered together and built defenses, which led to new ways or organizing society. Leaders became pharaohs and kings.
- Warriors/generals always had prominent positions in the social hierarchy.
- Caral, South America; 1000 years older but no evidence of warfare. No weapons, defensive fortifications, no city walls.
- Pottery: important for water, cereal, and for boiling up a substitute for mother's milk. It could have contributed to an acceleration of the population's growth rate.
- Loom, sailboat, metalworking, abstract math, astronomical observations, calendar, writing, plough/grain cultivation: essential requirements for the urban revolution.
- Catal Huyuk: a city where the levels of pottery, from box-shaped vessels to fine pots, are found.
  - Village vs city: not size, but a measure of social and economic differentiation.
  - Only farmers lived in villages, while a key defining feature of a town or city is that farmers don't live in them.
  - No evidence of craftsmen, merchants, priests, civil servants living off the surplus.
  - No temple, each house was a discrete entity.
  - No hierarchy.
  - Basically large enough to be a town, but retaining the social organization and features of a village.
  - Both hunter gatherers but also had domesticated sheep/goats.
  - No warfare that could have provoked the development.
  - Implication: As food acquisition methods changed, a shift in belief systems also developed.
  - Mirrors.
  - Painting of the surrounding mountain and the landscape.
  - Art: bull horns in some dedicated quarters.
  - Burial, along with the bulls. Since they buried ancestors beneath the living floor, the occupants have a claim to territorial ownership.
  - Craftsmen: initially, these came from people who didn't need to work for food and so they became specialists (potters, metalworkers, weavers, builders, etc.). Then, from having a craftsman go door to door, they could eventually set up a shop where people can visit them. Then, merchants came to trade, and managers suggested ways to manage society.
  - Although cities have always been sustained by agricultural surplus, they were not **created** by it. It was the establishment of cities that stimulated the production of agricultural surpluses. Societies and intensive farming came after the cities.

## Where Did It Begin?

- Euphrates/Tigris land was very flat.
- Slavery: all households had one or more slaves, and some estates had as many as ten or twenty in a single household. Children they have become property of the slave owner, and there were documents.
- Slaves were acquired by war and plunder, or from merchants specializing in the slave trade.
- There were instructions on text on how to harvest crops with a plough.
- Higher yields than in feudal Europe.
- They used the Euphrates to transport goods. City authorities also handled the distribution.

## Common Threads

- Some recipe from a city in souther Mesopotamia, inscribed on clay from 3700 years ago.
- They like cleanliness in the kitchen, and they like garnished food. There was steaming also.
- Streets were regularly littered with house sweepings and domestic rubbish.
- Thick walls (one meter thick) to moderate extremes of temperature.
- Windows faced inwards.
- School: math tablets, multiplication tables, religious and historical texts.
- There was this father who told his son: "I never made you do laborer things, all I did was to ask you to go to school." He just wanted the son to be happy though.
- In the harbor at Ur: the construction of a sea-going vessel that had a capacity of about 90 tons.
- Mathematics: reciprocals, multiplication, squares, square roots, cubes and cube roots, complex equations, exponential functions, coefficients, areas of rectangles, circles, irregular figures. Like the principles of Pythagorean theorem, 2000 years before Pythagoras was born.
- Math is helpful to know how much labor and earth you will need to excavate when you need to make a canal.
- No concept of a zero.
- Craftsmen, family businesses. Weaving was a favored occupation.
- Some lady complaining to a customer about how her necklace didn't have stones despite her paying him grain.
- Collapse was due to war, famine, flood, pestilence, political upheaval. Breakdown in social order. Mesopotamia had become overpopulated, and the gods had employed war, famine, etc. to keep the size of the human population under control.
- There was infanticide, chastity, celibacy, and methods of intercourse that avoid pregnancy, but ultimately none of this could save Mesopotamia from becoming the victim of its own success.
- The canals that drained water from the river to the plains also brought soluble salts to the surface, rendering the land increasingly saline and poisonous to crops. They tried to change from wheat to barley.

## War, Greece, and Rome

- Though warfare did not provoke the establishment of cities, there is plenty of evidence indicating that, once established, cities and the fruits of civilization become important factors in the development of military power.
- Because of cities, military equipment can now be produced on an industrial scale. Cities maintained armies of 600-700 men from an early stage (full-time soldiers).
- Greeks: had slaves (each male citizen owned an average of 2.5 slaves each).
- 2 slaves could be bought for the cost of hiring one artisan for a year (compared to one slave costing at least 4 times an artisan's annual wage in mid-nineteenth century America).
- Aegean Sea: bad land, and you can't grow the staple food (grain). The city-states inland had a smaller chance to alleviate their plight, while those on the coast looked across the sea for alternative supplies.
- Acquiring grain: left to private merchants, not the government.
- For the merchants to acquire grain constantly (not by attack and pillage), they had to offer something worthy of exchange (fruit, olives, oil, wine, pottery, cloth, metal goods).
- Famine was a permanent fact of life for most people in the ancient world, especially in the cities.
- The Roman state had a big involvement in the range of activities which supported the supply of corn to Rome. The feeding of Rome was always a political as well as an economic problem.
- Middle of second century BC, there were at least half a million people living in Rome.
- 123 BC: A law stating that the right of every Roman citizen to a monthly ration of grain at a fixed rate that undercut prevailing market prices.
- Clodius: 4 years later, he abolished payment of the grain ration. While this was nice, the rural poor drifted into Rome and whole families moved there to take advantage of the distribution. Then people who had slaves turned them into free men.
- Estimated that at 1 million people, they consumed about 5000 tons a week.
- Good road system but it was expensive: not enough for two wagons pass side by side.
- They got grain from North Africa. It took 2 days one way to get there. Going to Alexandria was harder.
