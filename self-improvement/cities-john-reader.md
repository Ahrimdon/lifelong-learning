# Cities

## First Impressions

- Venice: high tourist visits but decreasing population.

## How Did It Begin?

- India, Mesopotamia, China, Central America, Egypt, Peru: cities emerged but not at the same time, some 1000 years after the other.
- Why? Agriculture became viable, and people began living in settled communities, with some richer than others. Successful farmers gathered together and built defenses, which led to new ways or organizing society. Leaders became pharaohs and kings.
- Warriors/generals always had prominent positions in the social hierarchy.
- Caral, South America; 1000 years older but no evidence of warfare. No weapons, defensive fortifications, no city walls.
- Pottery: important for water, cereal, and for boiling up a substitute for mother's milk. It could have contributed to an acceleration of the population's growth rate.
- Loom, sailboat, metalworking, abstract math, astronomical observations, calendar, writing, plough/grain cultivation: essential requirements for the urban revolution.
- Catal Huyuk: a city where the levels of pottery, from box-shaped vessels to fine pots, are found.
  - Village vs city: not size, but a measure of social and economic differentiation.
  - Only farmers lived in villages, while a key defining feature of a town or city is that farmers don't live in them.
  - No evidence of craftsmen, merchants, priests, civil servants living off the surplus.
  - No temple, each house was a discrete entity.
  - No hierarchy.
  - Basically large enough to be a town, but retaining the social organization and features of a village.
  - Both hunter gatherers but also had domesticated sheep/goats.
  - No warfare that could have provoked the development.
  - Implication: As food acquisition methods changed, a shift in belief systems also developed.
  - Mirrors.
  - Painting of the surrounding mountain and the landscape.
  - Art: bull horns in some dedicated quarters.
  - Burial, along with the bulls. Since they buried ancestors beneath the living floor, the occupants have a claim to territorial ownership.
  - Craftsmen: initially, these came from people who didn't need to work for food and so they became specialists (potters, metalworkers, weavers, builders, etc.). Then, from having a craftsman go door to door, they could eventually set up a shop where people can visit them. Then, merchants came to trade, and managers suggested ways to manage society.
  - Although cities have always been sustained by agricultural surplus, they were not **created** by it. It was the establishment of cities that stimulated the production of agricultural surpluses. Societies and intensive farming came after the cities.

## Where Did It Begin?

- Euphrates/Tigris land was very flat.
- Slavery: all households had one or more slaves, and some estates had as many as ten or twenty in a single household. Children they have become property of the slave owner, and there were documents.
- Slaves were acquired by war and plunder, or from merchants specializing in the slave trade.
- There were instructions on text on how to harvest crops with a plough.
- Higher yields than in feudal Europe.
- They used the Euphrates to transport goods. City authorities also handled the distribution.
