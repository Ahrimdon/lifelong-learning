# Paul Graham on Procrastination
[link](http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html)

- It's impossible to cure procrastination, because there is an infinite things you can be doing. The question is, how do you procrastinate well.
- You can be
  - Working on nothing
  - Working on something less important
  - Working on something more important (good procrastination).
- Don't do the small stuff. ***Small stuff: work that has zero chance of being mentioned in your obituary.***
  - Ex: errands. Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.
- The types of work that can be done in long uninterrupted stretches = the important stuff.
  - Startups are usually productive in the beginning, where there's nothing to interrupt them yet.
  - Once you dilute a startup with ordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole company starts to resonate at their frequency. They're interrupt-driven, and soon you are too.
- ***Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of people use them for that purpose. Someone who has decided to write a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting in front of a blank page for days without writing anything.***

- **The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B procrastination, because it doesn't feel like procrastination. You're "getting things done." Just the wrong things.**

1. What are the most important problems in your field?
2. Are you working on one of them?
3. Why not?

- ***What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?***
  - If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself into doing it.
  - You have to work on small things that could grow into big things, or work on successively larger things, or split the moral load with collaborators.
  - When I talk to people who've managed to make themselves work on big things, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty about it.
- ***I think the way to "solve" the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you. Work on an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the wind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone.***

# Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity
[Reference](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html)

- Don't keep a schedule: work on whatever is most important or most interesting, at any time.
- For the most important things: "Let's meet now!"
- Anti-todo list: All the things you did that weren't the important things for the day.

- ***Structured Procrastination.***
  - Never fight the tendency to procrastinate: instead, use it to your advantage to get other things done.
- ***Strategic Incompetence.***
  - The best way to make sure you are never asked to do something again is to royally screw it up the first time you are asked to do it.
  - Things like organizing the company picnic, negotiating with insurance brokers, etc.
- ***Do email exactly twice a day, otherwise, keep your email client shut and your email notifications turned off.***
  - If you need to communicate with homies, just set up a separate email account for them.
  - First, finish each of your daily email sessions with a completely empty inbox.
  - Answer or file every message until you get to that empty inbox state of grace.
- ***Don't answer the phone.***
- ***Hide in an iPod.***
- ***Only agree to new commitments when both your head and your heart say yes.***
- ***Do something you love.***
