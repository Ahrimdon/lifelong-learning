# Paul Graham on Procrastination
[link](http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html)

- It's impossible to cure procrastination, because there is an infinite things you can be doing. The question is, how do you procrastinate well.
- You can be
  - Working on nothing
  - Working on something less important
  - Working on something more important (good procrastination).
- Don't do the small stuff. ***Small stuff: work that has zero chance of being mentioned in your obituary.***
  - Ex: errands. Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.
- The types of work that can be done in long uninterrupted stretches = the important stuff.
  - Startups are usually productive in the beginning, where there's nothing to interrupt them yet.
  - Once you dilute a startup with ordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole company starts to resonate at their frequency. They're interrupt-driven, and soon you are too.
- ***Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of people use them for that purpose. Someone who has decided to write a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting in front of a blank page for days without writing anything.***

- **The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B procrastination, because it doesn't feel like procrastination. You're "getting things done." Just the wrong things.**

1. What are the most important problems in your field?
2. Are you working on one of them?
3. Why not?

- ***What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?***
  - If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself into doing it.
  - You have to work on small things that could grow into big things, or work on successively larger things, or split the moral load with collaborators.
  - When I talk to people who've managed to make themselves work on big things, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty about it.
- ***I think the way to "solve" the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you. Work on an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the wind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone.***

# Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity
[Reference](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html)

- Don't keep a schedule: work on whatever is most important or most interesting, at any time.
- For the most important things: "Let's meet now!"
- Anti-todo list: All the things you did that weren't the important things for the day.

- ***Structured Procrastination.***
  - Never fight the tendency to procrastinate: instead, use it to your advantage to get other things done.
- ***Strategic Incompetence.***
  - The best way to make sure you are never asked to do something again is to royally screw it up the first time you are asked to do it.
  - Things like organizing the company picnic, negotiating with insurance brokers, etc.
- ***Do email exactly twice a day, otherwise, keep your email client shut and your email notifications turned off.***
  - If you need to communicate with homies, just set up a separate email account for them.
  - First, finish each of your daily email sessions with a completely empty inbox.
  - Answer or file every message until you get to that empty inbox state of grace.
- ***Don't answer the phone.***
- ***Hide in an iPod.***
- ***Only agree to new commitments when both your head and your heart say yes.***
- ***Do something you love.***

- Procrastination exists in the gap between intention and action.
- Procrastination is all about feeling good now.
- Procrastination feels good NOW, but has huge costs. It impacts performance, well-being, health, relationships, and causes ultimate regret.

## Components of the self-regulation failure

- *Personality:* People who are dutiful, self-disciplined, and conscientious have less problems with procrastination.
  - People with high impulsivity have more. Socially prescribed perfectionism (external expectations) are associated with procrastination.
  - Emotional intelligence. Improving emotional intelligence makes you less likely to procrastinate. When you improve your ability to perceive, use, manage, and understand your emotions, you gain it's easier to control than be controlled by them.
  - People who don't have a developed sense of identity procrastinate more.
- *Nature of goals and intention.*
  - A lack of meaning or reason to care makes a task aversive. During the action phase, a lack of structure, autonomy, and control. At all phases: boredom, frustration, resentment.
  - Temporal construal theory: the way we construe things affects our temporal perception of it. When you think about things concretely, they belong to today. Concrete things are urgent.
- *Cognitions and beliefs:* We work better under pressure? Not true. You have to think in an "I could have done better" mentality.
- *Self-control and will power.* This is a finite resource so be strategic. Mindful meditation, value affirmation (why the fuck am I doing this).

- The best strategy to stop procrastinating? Move from goal intentions to implementation intentions. "In situation X, I will do behavior Y to achieve sub-goal Z."
- The reason you procrastinate is to avoid having an emotion you do not want to experience (boredom, fear, stress...) but in doing so you create further negative emotions and end up in a stressful trap. Non-judgemental awareness of one's emotions allows one to push ahead with the action (doing your work), despite "not feeling like it".
- You can be aware that you do not feel like it and that you feel worse when you initially start the task, but decide not to fight that emotion (give into the urge to make yourself 'feel better') and take action while feeling bad (rather than waiting until you 'feel like it').
