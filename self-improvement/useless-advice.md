#### #5. "You Just Need to Watch What You Eat! (or Drink, or Smoke, etc)"

The fat people you make fun of and condescend to probably have more will power than you do. That's because in order to just stay at their weight, they have to successfully resist the urge to eat more often that you do.

That's because obesity physically changes the brain. The obese eat more, because they feel the urge more, more often, and they feel it much stronger. Their muscle tissue also burns fewer calories.

*Try saying:* "When I went through what you are going through, this is what worked for me..."

Recovered addicts can give good advice to addicts, and no one else really can. Don't pull the "you can have one slice!" BS. *If you've been through the grieving process, you may have good tips for your grieving friend; otherwise, just be an ear.*

_If you hear the word "just" coming out of your mouth, clamp down your teeth and chew off your tongue._

#### #4. "You Just Need to Cheer Up!"

The worst part about being frequently in bad moods is knowing that everyone is going to bug you about it -- the people who like you will ask why, and the people who don't like you will whisper to one another that you're in "one of your moods".

It's insane -- clearly these people know from their own bad moods taht they can't flip their emotional states on and off like a switch. What they're really saying is "Stop being in such a bad mood around me, because it's bumming me out."

*Try saying:* "So, how are things going?"

Some people like talking about their problems and some don't. So if you notice a friend is down, give them an opening to talk about it. Don't phrase it was "why are you in a bid mood?" or "tell me that's going on", because you're just *interrogating them* or *issuing a command*. And if they make it clear that they don't want to talk about it, please respect that.

Here's why I think "You need to cheer up!" is the downfall of civilization: *It's the fact that we're treating sadness like it's a heart attack or seizure, something that requires an emergency response. It's not -- it's a perfectly normal, valid state of mind.* Sometimes things don't go your way, so you get sad about it. Then things get better and you're happy and the happiness is sweeter because you remember being sad.

And I think this belief that a normal, well-adjusted human should be happy every waking moment is killing us. It trains us to constantly be seeking little pleasures and distractions (video games, porn, food, weed) to prevent deep reflection on a bad situation, to the point taht we consider a normal mood is just a state of breezy distraction.

*Any kind of success (financial, personal, spiritual, whatever) depends on your ability to delay gratification.* You tolerate the tedious hell of learning a new task, and then it pays off after you've learned it. You tolerate the humiliation of failing at somethign new until you get good enough not to fail. But during the hard part, you have all of these voices telling you, "Any pain and sadness you feel isn't normal and needs to be cured immediately."

#### #3. "You Just Need to Believe in Yourself!"

Yes, confidence works. People love confidence.

But, like most of the advice on this list, it completely misunderstands what it's asking the other person to do.

*Confidence is inspiring and sexy because it is an indicator of past successes.* If I had not actually had that past success, then you're asking me to simply get good at _faking_ confidence. And while this is useful advice, it's probably not what you intended.

Chad, you have confidence to ask girls out because they have always responded to you in a certain way. You don't know what I'm talking about, because you have never had it any other way.

Everyone's life is hard, but everyone's life is hard in a different way, and confidence is not some secret sauce that solves everything. Your confidence is the result of your past success, not the cause. It's like telling a poor person, "You just need to have some money, bro!"

*Try saying:*

"Remember that, ultimately, nobody gives a fuck."

*The idea is that you build confidence with successes, and you get those by starting small and falling a few times, figuring thigns out as you go.* What makes people afraid to do that is the fear of looking foolish to the world when they fail. That is based on the mistaken idea that the entire world is watching you and waiting to laugh at your mistakes.

*The comforting reality is nobody a fuck.* People are simply too tied up with their own lives to care about your failures. The rest of the world never cared enough to even have anything to forget. 

#### #2. "Just Be Yourself!"

If you're walking into a situation where you need to make a good impression and all you have to go on is "Just be yourself"... well there is no such thing. There is no "yourself" to be.

This is like "Follow your gut", which is a recipe for goddamn disaster -- *the careful consideration taht makes you back off from your first impulse is just as much a part of "you" as your "gut".*

*Try saying:*

"Learn how you look to other people."

Instead of "just be yourself", try "just know yourself". Know who you are to other people. 

Society is full of all sorts of arbitrary rules that you violate ona near day-to-day basis because you're not even aware of them. Learning those rules -- by observing and listening to people -- will go a lot further in making a good impression than just "being yourself".

*You need to learn what statement it makes when you wear a backward baseball cap in certain company, or talk about your anime collection, or choose not to offer a handshake. Know what message your choices send.*

#### #1. "You Just Need to Find What You Were Meant to Do With Your Life!"

Back then, if you were the child of a sheep herder, you were "meant" to be a freaking sheep herder. Your "calling" in life was to keep the sheep alive, and to get enough food to last the winter, and for your father to arrange your marriage. This whole concept of reaching your 20s and having to suddenly "find your calling" is a brand new idea in society.

This means you have to forge your own future, and the potential for you to screw it up is huge.

*Try saying:*

"If this is what you want to do, you have to keep trying."

I think people use "Just find what you were meant to do!" to really mean "Just figure out what your talents are." *But for most of us, that won't be apparent for years and years -- you have to try a bunch of shit and see what works.* And what "works" isn't "what you are instantly good at the first time you try it", rather "what engages you, and what you seem to be able to make satisfactory progress learning."

As far as I can tell, success is heavily based on luck -- it's just that long hours earn you more chances to get lucky. The more stuff you do, the more people you meet and impress, the more chances for opportunity to come your way.

Whiel I lucked out when my coffee table book was adapted into film, when that happend, I was also working two different jobs in two different industries and updating two different websites on the side.

This took about 90 hours a week of my time, and I had been grinding away like that for 10 years.

*But for me to act like it was "meant" to happen would also be implying that all of the people slowly starving to death in NK prison camps are part of God's plan.*

There's no magic formula for making it happen. You just keep grinding, and eventually something will come along. Or not.
