## Arjuna Perkins

1. *Humility.* Supporting yourself, managing your time/stress/relationships, figuring out what role you want work/study/spirituality to play in your life. Very few get through their twenties without some serious soul searching and questioning of fundamental beliefs and habits. *This is the best time in your life to be making mistakes. It gets steadily less socially acceptable as you progress in age, so go crazy!*
2. *Honesty.* You don't get away with anything. *If you're full of it, people will see that, no matter how vainly you struggle to hide it.* The sooner you can come to integrity with yourself and the world at large, the sooner you'll be able to get working towards what you really want, who you really want to be. That ugly person you think you are hiding inside is actually going to be the most compelling, most interesting, most powerful manifestation of yourself.
3. *Health.* You don't get away with self-abuse. Have your fun, but remember: they call it excess for a reason. Eat well, get exercise, get enough sleep, try to have a steady sex life when you can.
4. *Pay close attention to who you find yourself attracted to.*
5. *Get used to being wrong.* Conviction can be a symptom of narrow-mindedness. Chances are, whatever you believe now will be out of the window at some point in the future, so get used to being open to other assessments of what's true. Chances are also that someone out there knows a lot more about X, Y, and Z than you do. *Let go of having to be right about things, this isn't a contest, it's not a game, you don't win at life.* So say, "thanks for your perspective, I'll think about that", or "I was wrong, I'm sorry."
6. *Perseverance.* You will fail in life, over and over and over. It won't feel fair, maybe for decades, you just got to keep moving forward. Keep going, keep going!

## Hugh Powell

You never really become an adult, just that people start expecting you to act like one. So you start pretending to be grown up, even though you still feel like a scared little child.

*No matter how good you get at playing the adult, don't forget that underneath it all, at any age, you are always a scared little child, with no idea of what you are doing. That way, you will forgive yourself easier when you screw up, become afraid, act weak, and hide from the truth. For these things will always be with you.*

This makes it easier for you to forgive others when they screw up, because you know they're pretending too.

## Rick Tatum

- Love hurts, but not as much as not loving.
- The friendships you nurture will have a greater effect on your life than where you work or what you earn.
- You are not your job, you are not your bankroll, you are not the sum of your possessions.
- The company does not love you. You are replaceable. Keep your parachute handy.
- Few decisions will ever shape your future life more than you choose to marry. To marry well, you must choose well.
- Love is a commitment.
- Passions grow out of your values. Make early, wise choices to value what and who is good, trustworthy, and praiseworthy.
- Integrity preserved is honor won.
- Rejoice in your health. It fades fast.
- Find a passion. Pick a hobby, own it: photography, juggling, whatever. Get your 10K hours of perfect practice in early and change your life.
- Don't bother comparing yourself to others--this only leads to heartbreak, anger, and disappointment.
- Most disappointments grow from unmet expectations. Set realistic expectations for yourself, based on your strengths, then strive to exceed them.
- Don't drive others to meet expectations they've committed to--lead, inspire, and help them do it.
- Don't set expectations for others when they haven't or cannot commit to them.
- Don't complain. Either change your situation, learn to cope, or change your perspective.
- Don't worry about making big bucks out of the gate, worry first about doing whatever you have to do excellently.
- Don't look down on others because they don't have what you didn't earn--your intellect, your beauty, and your culture of birth are undeserved gifts. Be humble.
- Avoid fights. Nobody wins in a fight, even if you walk away unscathed. When a fight picks you, leave everything on the mat and give it your all. Hold nothing back.
- If you're bored, you're doing it wrong.
- Protect your joy. Nothing is easier to lose by over-thinking, over-analyzing, and second-guessing. On the other hand, always consider the long-term consequences of your choices: stupid decisions made in the moment can rob you of years of joy and happiness.
- It truly matters what you think about. Think well by reading good books, building good, loving relationships, having good conversation, and imitating great people.

## Thea Pilarczyk

*It's OK if you don't know what you want to do with the rest of your life, but don't use that as an excuse to stagnate.* Your twenties will probably be some of your fondest years; you have the freedom of living on your own, without the responsibility of having a family to care and provide for. Don't waste it building a career you're not interested in just because you're supposed to already have it figured out, and don't waste it stressing because you haven't figured that out yet.

And, worst of all, don't be content with sitting at home doing the same thing you did through your teens just because it's comfortable; if you don't want to build a career or go to school, at least keep learning, trying new things, meeting new people. Enhance your experience wherever you can, and see what new paths open up for you.

*Even the worst job you will ever work at has something to teach you - so stop complaining and pay attention.* I have worked at some pretty awful jobs in my life; positions that included slicing my fingers open, being literally screamed at daily, handed a bounced paycheck, and one that after a few months made me literally want to vomit every day. But instead of feeling sorry for myself and just toughing it out until I could find something else, I paid attention to the things I didn't know and how I could learn them. People were making a lot of money, I paid attention to how. Leaders were making strategic decisions, I figured out why. I was proactive and moved up, because I knew that when I left I would have a better title, better resume, and higher pay grade.

## Mallory Armstrong

The things that you fear most, that are most uncomfortable, are often most important for you to do. And you might as well do them if it's related to that "big dream", because time will pass anyway. And in your twenties often the worst thing that can happen is you move back in with your parents. So do it now while you have relatively little to lose, and more time to rebuild than you ever will again.

Read more, never stop trying to learn, cling to your idealism and don't give up on your dreams. Surround yourself with those who push you, believe in you, will give you the advice you need to hear but don't want to (and know when to give you the advice you ask to hear when needed because sometimes you just need to shelter/protect your confidence).

Choose a real partner in life. Your strategic alliance (ref. Napoleon Hill).

Set goals and write them down. Celebrate your successes then write new ones.

## Ellie Sidell

1. *School's over. Snap out of it: there's no gold stars anymore.* You won't get a grade after everything you do, whether it be in your social or professional life. It might sound shocking, but sometimes I still find myself waiting for the approval of some figure of authority. Make sure you measure your achievements against your goals and not by the opinion of others. After all, you'll be your toughest judge in the end and how you feel about what you've accomplished is what really matters.
2. *Life is not a smooth paved road. It's a winding, bumpy, and slightly obscured mountain path.* I often feel that we were taught that after college you'd know where you were going and how to get there. There's no set plan, so really take the time to think about what you want in life and what will make you happy.
3. *Learn to value the friends you have and how to make new ones.* Friendship loses some of its organic interaction as you become older. It takes a lot of time and effort to make sure you see all the people you care about and make sure that you maintain relationships in a way that is satisfactory to all parties. You also learn to spend the free time with the people who truly care about you and not waste it on those who don't.
4. *Take care of yourself.* Learn to eat better, get enough sleep, exercise regularly, cut out/down on some of your more unhealthy choices and de-stress yourself as much as possible. In the long run, you won't regret it and you'll probably feel a lot better too!
5. *Don't judge so much.* Form your opinions, but make sure you remember that you're not here to be the judge of everyone and everything. I am a big fan of standing up for yourself and your opinions, but everything in moderation. It's important to learn that not everyone has to agree. You can agree to disagree - that's one of the great beauties in life. Try to keep an open mind and if you're having a tough time with that, just think very carefully before you speak!
6. *Have fun - don't forget to live your life.* It's easy to get caught up in your twenties with the whole "I'm an adult" mantra and completely throw yourself into work. Don't forget to spend some time on yourself and really enjoy life! We're not on this earth forever and everyone deserves to enjoy the time we're lucky enough to have.

## Brandon Chu

1. There are always going to be people who are smarter, better looking, more sociable, and just all around "better" than you. In fact, you'll learn there are LOTS of people who fit that description. To be happy, then, you have to learn to accept yourself and your shortcomings.
2. Success does indeed come from hard work. Hard work without talent doesn't ensure success, but talent without hard work ensures mediocrity.
3. It's unlikely you'll become anything close to your wildest ambitions, simply because you'll learn everyone has big ambitions, and there's only so many slots in this world.
4. Idealism aside, money = opportunity and therefore matters. Relationships and power matter more.
5. Friendship isn't forever. Social and economic status does create divides and strains in even the oldest relationships.
6. Your parent basically gave up their freedom to raise you, and deserve a medal. You know this because with only one job on your plate, you already have no time.
7. Adult life is about learning to live with ambiguity. Remember when you thought you'd have it all sorted out by 30? No. Whether it be your career, your relationships or your beliefs, you will always question whether you are making the right choices and will have to deal with regret.
8. Metabolism slows.

Don't be afraid of the truth. Tell the truth and expect the truth, even when it hurts and it sucks. This will definitely make things easier and more straight forward in the long run. It applies to personal relationships as well as professional. If your boss asks you if you can finish in 2 weeks, but you know it'll take at least 4, don't tell your boss that you can finish in 2 just to make him/her happy. DON'T DO IT. BE HONEST. Tell them how long you think it'll take and why. They'll likely be more understand than you think while probably still expecting you to put in some extra hours to get it done in less time than you originally thought.

Learn to negotiate. Buying a house or car? Low ball the offer. Chances are the number they have posted is higher than they plan to get, meaning they've built their initial price expecting to be low balled or get more than the object is worth. Think you deserve more money at work, but the raise your boss presented you with isn't what you want? Say something. Tell them why you think you deserve more, but again be honest with yourself and with them. Do you really deserve more? Or are you just lying to yourself. Maybe they won't give you more even if you deserve it, but at least you tried. And now you need to decide what to do, which brings me to my next point.

Something not right in your life? Do something about it. No one else will. If you think you are being undervalued at work say something. If nothing comes from it look for new employment. Overweight? Work out. Feeling sad? Do something fun. Stop saying you'll do it tomorrow or later and DO IT NOW. Successful people do things when they need to be done, they grab life by the horns and do it.

Plan ahead. Think things through, don't plan out too many of the details, but think about the multiple possibilities and outcomes of a situation. Don't necessarily dwell on it, but give it some real thought.

Don't be afraid to fail. If you are afraid to fail then you'll never push yourself to do new and better things. Just be sure to learn from your failures and make the most of the lessons they provide. See a pretty girl or cute guy? Ask them out. Want to run a marathon but think to yourself "Well I can't even run a mile." It doesn't matter. TRY. Run the mile today. Tomorrow run 1.5, the next day run 2. You can do it.

TRUST YOUR GUT. To me, this has been the most important. One major thing is though, learn to differentiate between your gut feelings and your emotions and animalistic instincts (AKA sexual needs). Your subconscious almost always knows what's right and what you should do. You need to learn to listen to it. It can get you out of many sticky situations as well as help you take advantage of great opportunities that may only arise for a second.

Don't stress out over the little things. Your room is a mess, your car needs to get washed, you have a paper to write, you have a deadline at work, you have dishes in the sink, your friends expect you to go out to dinner tonight, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?!?!! Simple. Write your paper. Finish your work. Tell your friends you'll catch up with them another time. Your dishes, your car, and your room can wait to be cleaned. When you're stressing about all the things you have to do, look at your list, and for each item ask yourself "What's the worst that could happen if I don't do this?"

Be a realistic optimist. Keep your dreams in front of you and your head in the clouds, but always remember that your feet are on the ground and you're still just human. Have an idea for a start up? Awesome. Work at it, but remember, it might not work, it might not happen, and it will only happen if you work really hard, but it is possible. This goes hand in hand with number 7: Don't be afraid to fail. Always look at the upside of a situation, which also goes with number 9: Don't stress about the little things. Laugh. Laugh at everything. Everything is funny in some way. Find the good. Laugh a little, and know when to buckle down and be serious.

## Jim Stone

You can do anything, but you can't do everything.

Build career capital. *When you're 20, you don't know all the things there are to be passionate about.* You will also find that your deepest passions will come when you're truly good at something. Get good and connected first, and then, when you are 35, you will naturally find yourself following passions much more compelling than the silly little things you called "passions" when you were 20.

*Don't seek autonomy too soon.* Develop excellence in your field, get some connections, get a good feel for your industry, and squirrel away some "frak you" money before trying to set out on your own. It will usually work out better that way.

*Focus on what Paul Graham calls "upwind skills." Upwind skills are things like writing, mathematics, design, and programming. These skills take time to build, and they will keep your options open more than other areas of focus.*

Be less judgmental. When you see a doctor who doesn't know how to troubleshoot his car problems, don't scoff. Sure you COULD become a doctor if you wanted to. And you COULD become a master mechanic if you wanted to, but you likely won't become both. You'll learn soon enough that you, too, will need to specialize, and can't become good at everything. So stop projecting in your daydreams to a future self that is good at writing, programming, medicine, design, history, and auto mechanics. Just because you have a passing knowledge of those things at 20 doesn't mean you'll be an expert in all of them when you're 35. So don't judge the practitioner of X who shows a poor knowledge of Y. Instead appreciate how he or she does X.
