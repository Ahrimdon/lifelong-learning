# 5 common beliefs of the self-made rich

1. *Money CAN buy you happiness.* The rich know that while having money doesn't guarantee happiness, it sure helps. More than anything, money buys freedom; the freedom to do what you want, on your own terms. The myth that money can't buy you happiness is perpetuated wishfully by those with no experience of it.

2. *Formal education is largely useless.* Degrees and doctorates may increase your sense of security, but they do not pave the route to wealth. The self-made rich are experts at amassing uncommon and high-leverage practical knowledge, such as confidence, leadership, self-direction, self-awareness, sales, marketing, creativity and insight. They invest in themselves.

3. *Passion pays.* To many, it may look like the rich are working all the time.*But their secret is doing what they love and finding a way to get paid for it.* By doing this, they’re able to commit themselves at a level that others simply can't match. Most people make the mistake of perpetually exchanging their time for money, and never escape this trap.

4. *Find comfort in uncertainty.* Most people value certainty and safety above all else. It's the reason they’ll stay in a job they hate, or pursue an education they don't need. But for those who can feel comfortable within it, uncertainty presents unique and exciting opportunities that few have the strength to appreciate. Those who can thrive in uncertainty will lead those who can't, and the future is always uncertain.

5. *Low expectations are for low achievers.* We've been told that setting lower expectations helps reduce our disappointment, and it's true. Discomfort sucks. But no-one ever struck it rich on modest expectations.

# 5 secrets for getting your writing noticed

1. *The world owes you nothing.*

We live at the centre of our own private universes, which can fool us into thinking the world responds to our merits, as we see them. If you believe this, you’re in for a lifetime of tear-stained keyboards.

2. *Give people a reason to care.*

If you want an audience, don't write for yourself. Forget yourself. Start with:

Who am I writing for?
What can I do for them?
Why should they care?

Let's say you’re writing for casual bloggers. It's not hard to think of things that casual bloggers might struggle with (“How to win your first thousand followers”), find entertaining (“My blog cost me my job, wife and kids”) or inspiring (“How my blog got me a date with Natalie Portman”). Start there.

3. *Hook emotionally.*

*Brilliant intellectuals can appreciate content on a purely intellectual basis. For everyone else, there's urgent news, themselves, gossip, and sex.*

You know when you feel compelled to click on a link? You don't have time to think about it. Hooks are entirely emotional:

*Scary & urgent* – “Terrorists will attack your town, tomorrow”
*Big names* – “A day in the life of Tony Stark”
*Self-interest* – “How to win your dream girl”
*Sex appeal* – “The hottest babes in tennis”
*Trendsetting* – “The show everyone is talking about”

These emotions can be conveyed in a headline. Your headline is where you will win or lose most of your audience. A title in a tweet is judged and dismissed by 99% of your audience before they see another word; ensure yours punches them in their emotional face.

4. *Edit as much as you write.*

Don't mistake editing for proof reading. Editing is where you take your work apart in a blender, rearrange, rewrite and rethink everything. Everything. You must edit for:

- *Verbosity.* Nothing will kill attention faster than excess words.
- *Confusion.* Your readers may not speak English as their first language. They may be bouncing a baby on their lap. Don't make them think any harder than they have to.
- *Predictability.* If someone can guess your next sentence from the previous one, you have a delicious unicycling mongoose.

5. *Build a platform.*

If you’re searching for an audience, it doesn't take long to realise that the famous get most of the attention. The mistake is to assume this dooms you to failure. You just need to become slightly more famous.

It's slowest at the start, which is where most people give up. My writing did nothing for 4 months; later that year I had 4 million views. Write continuously, and test everything you can think of. Think of it like tuning a radio.

To win in the long term, your platform must efficiently convert readers into followers. Forget likes and tweets; *followers are what you’re after.* If you write something and it doesn't clearly encourage people to follow you, you’re playing the wrong game. Also, follow me on Twitter.

Some writers may find this a bit dirty. Unfortunately, it's also how people work. You must appeal to their nature before you can win them over with your writing. Otherwise no-one will even know what they’re missing.

# How to succeed when you have no special skills

Bill Gates is not the best programmer in the world, nor is he the world's greatest speaker, salesperson, visionary or accountant. He's good enough at these things though, and he's learnt to weld his skills together into something far more valuable.

Even when your skills are mediocre, an astute combination of mediocrity can turn you into something priceless.

Say you’re a passable tennis player. By itself, this skill isn't worth much. But you learn to combine that skill with the ability to teach well. Later, you figure out how to make tuition videos, and how to promote yourself on the Internet. You won't be the best at making videos, or online promotion, but even mediocre skills combined are unique. You could build a thriving online business doing what you love and yet all your individual skills never advanced beyond ‘good-ish’.

This works for any profession. An average businessperson who learns a bit of law, or body language, or programming, or design, or public speaking, can assert a monumental advantage over their peers. Indeed, you might say what makes someone a great businessperson is a fusion of relevant skills, like psychology and self-discipline.

Individual skills are common. Combinations are rarer. If you want to raise your value, take a step back from your strengths, and consider building a broader combination of them.

# How to master your time

The secret to time management is simple: Jedi time tricks.

And so it is with your life. You have things that are most important and things that are most urgent in permanent competition: The secret to mastering your time is to systematically focus on importance and suppress urgency. Humans are pre-wired to focus on things which demand an immediate response, like alerts on their phones – and to postpone things which are most important, like going to the gym. You need to reverse that, which goes against your brain and most of human society.

Look at what you spend your day doing. Most of it, I’ll warrant, is not anything you chose – it's what is being asked of you.

- Say no. Most of us follow an implicit social contract: when someone asks you to do something you almost always say yes. You may need to sacrifice some social comfort to save a life (as a bonus, people tend to instinctively respect those who can say no).
- Kill notifications. Modern technology has evolved to exploit our urgency addiction. Choose to check these things when you have time to be distracted – say, during a lunch break – and work through them together, saving time.
- Schedule your priorities. If you have something that matters to you more than anything – say writing a book, or going to the gym – you won't schedule it. You’ll just "get round to it". Treat your highest priorities like flights you have to catch: give them a set time in advance and say no to anything that would stop you making your flight.
- First things first. What is the single most important (not urgent) thing you could possibly be doing? Do some of that today.
- Less volume, more time. There's always millions of things you could be doing. The trick is to pick no more than 1 – 3 a day, and relentlessly pursue those. Your brain won't like this limit. Other people won't like this limit. Do it anyway. Focusing your all on one task at a time is infinitely more efficient than multi-tasking and gives you time to excel at your work.
- Ignore. It's rude, unprofessional and often utterly necessary. There are people you won't find time to reply to. The world won't fall apart. The payoff is you get done what matters.

Heroes inspire us for many reasons: they make tough decisions, they keep going and they get done what matters. But there's another reason we love our heroes. Inside us all, we know we have the power to become one ourselves.

# How to win your first clients

*Credibility comes ahead of time.* A new business has no reputation. So at the start, all credibility is on you, the founder.

For my part, I built websites as a student. One in particular – a social network for my university – had grown to thousands of active users, and was raising a lot of controversy on campus.

I made stuff like this simply because I wanted to, and the passion showed. When you can't find paid work, create stuff for free. Free work is your way of bootstrapping credibility, and you don't need anyone's permission to earn it.

*Enthusiasm + knowledge.*

I was not a conventional salesman, with slicked back hair and fancy suits. I was however, fiercely enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable. And it turns out that matters more.

People buy from people. They evaluate you as a person, and that person had better be convincing. If you are sincerely bubbling over with excitement at all the wonderful things you could do for them, your enthusiasm will win many people over. Your credibility (above) should do the rest.

Confidence will come with time. But the best way to build confidence is to become good at something and get yourself in front of people who will appreciate it.

*Get in front of everyone you know.*

My first sale – a £3,000 ($5,000) website – was to the residence where I had lived as a student.

These were people I knew. I already knew them and what they wanted; they were sold on the basis of my free social network and the fact that they knew me.

This is the key. People buy from who they know. You probably don't want to hear that, but that doesn't mean it's not true. Just being vaguely known by that guy who knows that guy is enough to get you in the door of most places.

I sold to the school where I'd studied at university. I pitched to the companies where my friends were working. Every single person I knew, however low-level they might seem, was a potential inroad to another opportunity. This alone got me a sale to a FORTUNE 500 company (3M) in our first year.

Later I would learn about "networking events", but I didn't use any for the first 6 years of my business. The best lead is always from someone you already know, and the biggest mistake people make is assuming that they don't know anyone.

*Get in at the ground floor on big names.*

My first tiny sale to a department of a university suddenly gave me the ability to say “I did a website for this university”. Never mind that it was a small project; it could have been free. The most powerful indicator of credibility is not your work, it's the names you can associate with.

One great side effect of big names is they tend to have lots of staff, who move on to other organisations and recommend you. Someone from that university started working for a local council, and soon I had my first government client. Someone there moved on and I had another. Big names attract big names.

Another great thing about big names – you can grow within them. Over the next 5 years that small school website let us pitch for their parent department, and ultimately the whole university – over 20,000 pages and a lot more money. We never lost that contract in 10 years.

Crucially: deliver on service. If you don't make your clients happy, none of this will happen.

*Write and sound the part.*

You want to look presentable, of course, but don't invest your hopes into this. Your appearance won't win many sales, but a bad appearance will certainly cost you some.

Master speaking and writing clearly. The quality of your communication is one of the strongest indicators people will use when judging you; it can make a smart kid sound stupid, or an idiot sound vaguely intelligent. If you don't know how to use apostrophes or capital letters, you'd best believe people who do will not judge you kindly. And they will never tell you.

# Summary

- If you have no reputation, work for free.
- People buy from people, so be enthusiastic and knowledgeable.
- Reach out to everyone you know.
- One tiny sale to a big name is a pole you can build your reputation on.
- Big organisations spread word of mouth far faster.
- Look the part, but more importantly: write and sound the part.
- Don't expect results from SEO, advertising or status symbols.

# Three words of advice for the young and ambitious

*Create.*

Creating things is the secret path that lets you do whatever you want.

How did I become a writer? I wrote. How did I become a programmer? I programmed. How did I become an entrepreneur? I started a company. I never had professional training in any of those things, and it never mattered, because I gave it to myself. You can too. Create the right things and you don't need a resume. Create things worth noticing, and you will be noticed.

Creating is also a way of extending yourself. Your writing, or your art, or your company – all these things add to you worth, and the right creations fuse and compound over time. Think of it like buying shares in yourself.

Most people make the mistake of permanently exchanging their time for money, aka "employment". This leads to a lifetime trap of spending time to earn money. If instead you invest your time in making things of value, those things can take life of their own, and work for you while you sleep. You’ll be happier and in greater control of your destiny too.

*Big.*

The thing no-one tells you about aiming big is that you pretty much always win.

That doesn't mean you get what you planned; in fact, that almost never happens. But you almost certainly won't completely fail, and what successes you have will almost always outweigh your losses.

Say you aim to write a single Facebook status. However that goes, you’re not likely to win or lose much. Instead say you aim to write a whole novel. There's a good chance you will fail to finish, or take five times longer than you expect, or write utter garbage that never makes it past three unhappy relatives. But in the process you will have pushed your skills beyond their point of comfort, and grown immensely. More so than most people do in their whole lifetimes.

If you keep doing this, eventually, something is going to work. And you only need one big win to set you for life.

*Defy.*

If you think the world is logical or fair, you’re going to be frustrated and sad most of your life.

The world does, actually, make a lot of sense. But not in the way that you might think. *Working hard is not enough. Being smart is not enough. Really wanting stuff is not enough.* Your instincts and upbringing may tell you otherwise. They are wrong.

The thing that will hold you back the most, throughout your entire life, will be yourself. You will know what to do. You will want to do it. And yet you will find yourself failing, and you won't know why.

Most people reflexly blame the world when this happens: "my boss is blind", "the economy is hopeless", "girls are stupid". Externalizing leads only to denial and pain. What you need to do – all you need to do – is look inside yourself, and ask what, if anything, you could be doing differently. If you’re certain the problem is outside of your power, drop it, and move on.

# Life is a game. This is your strategy guide.

Now that you’re playing properly, your top priority is to assign your time as well as possible. Every single thing you do affects your state and your skills:

Programming: +Coding skills, +Career prospects, +Logic

Drinking: -Health, -Energy, -Money

How to obey your own commands: Everybody has a state (health, energy, willpower) and if the state gets too low in one area, your body will disobey your own instructions until your needs are met.

Your willpower level is especially important. Willpower fades throughout the day, and is replenished slightly by eating, and completely by a good night's sleep. When your willpower is low, you are only able to do things you really want to.

Every decision you have to make costs willpower, and decisions where you have to suppress an appealing option for a less appealing one (e.g. exercise instead of watch TV) require a lot of willpower.

There are various tricks to keep your behaviour in line:

- Keep your state high. If you’re hungry, exhausted, or utterly deprived of fun, your willpower will collapse. Ensure you take consistently good care of  yourself.
- Don't demand too much willpower from one day. Spread your most demanding tasks over multiple days, and mix them in with less demanding ones.
- Attempt the most important tasks first. This makes other tasks more difficult, but makes your top task more likely.
- Reduce the need to use willpower by reducing choices. If you’re trying to work on a computer that can access Facebook, you’ll need more willpower because you’re constantly choosing the hard task over the easy one. Eliminate such distractions.

# Combinations of skills are effective.
- Biz + Confidence + Psych = Entrepreneur
- Cooking + Dancing + Psych = Ladies Magnet

Environment is important. Research the best location to move to.

# Finding a partner

Attraction is a complex mini-game in itself, but mostly a byproduct of how you’re already playing. If you have excellent state and high skills, you’re far more attractive already. A tired, irritable, unskilled player is not appealing, and probably shouldn’t be looking for a relationship.

Early in the game it can be common to reject and be rejected by other players. This is normal, but unfortunately it can drain your state, as most players don’t handle rejection or rejecting well. You’ll need to expend willpower to keep going, and willpower is replenished by sleep, so give it time.

80% of finding someone comes down to being your most attractive self, which – like so much in life – just means putting your time in the right places. If you’re exercising, socialising, well nourished and growing in your career, you will radiate attraction automatically. The remaining 20% is simply putting yourself in places where you can meet the right people.

# Money money money

The most important rule of money is never to borrow it, except for things that earn you more back. For example, education or a mortgage can be worthwhile (but are not necessarily so, depending on the education or the mortgage). Borrowing to buy new shoes is not.

# Later life

All players die after about 29,000 days, or 80 years. If your stats and skills are good, you might last a little longer. There is no cheat code to extend this.
