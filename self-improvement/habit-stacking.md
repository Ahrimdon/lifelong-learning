## Habit Stacking

- The best way to build a habit stack is to combine actions related to what you want from life. Don't add random habits together that have no potential meaning.
- Career, finance, health, leisure, organizing (cleaning your environment), relationship goals, spirituality goals (prayer, yoga, helping others).

- Is there a s mall habit that can support a major habit? (Packing exercise clothes in the morning so they'll be ready for the gym in the evening.)
- Do I often end the day frustrated because I didn't complete the most important tasks?
- What quick activities make me feel inspired or happy? (Watching a short motivational video every morning.)
- What five goals are the most important to me right now?
- What are the activities that I love to do?
- What areas of my financial life do I need to improve?
- Can I improve the quality of my interpersonal relationships?
- What makes me feel great about myself?
- How can I become more spiritual in my daily life?
- What is a new skill I've always wanted to master?
- Is there anything I can do to support my local community or an important cause?
- Is there something that I can do to improve my job performance and get a raise?

### Keystone Habits

- These have a positive impact on multiple areas of your life--ex: thirty minute daily exercise routine.
- Typically, people who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family. They feel less stressed.
- Meditating, tracking expenses, planning your day, scheduling meals with your family.
- I focus on five keystone habits each day:
  - Completing a habit stacking routine (small, hard to consistently remember without a reminder, ex: journaling, reviewing my goals, drinking water.)
  - Writing for at least 30 minutes (impacts income, personal fulfillment, and relaxation.)
  - Finishing 3 work-related tasks (related to the business.)
  - Exercising for at least 30 minutes.
  - Reading at least 2 pages of a nonfiction book (the more I read, the more I'm able to come up with an interesting idea to include in my writing.)

### Support Habits

- They support the achievement of an important keystone habit.
- Examples:
  - Check the weather forecast to see if I exercise outdoors or at the gym.
  - Plan my schedule each morning: "What time will I run today?" and "What clothes do I need to bring with me?"
  - Pack my exercise clothes in the morning before leaving my house.
  - Drink 64 ounces of water to  make sure I'm properly hydrated for my runs.
  - Weigh myself each morning.
  - Record each run in my Runner's log app.
  - Wear Fitbit to count my daily steps.

### Elephant Habits

- Chip away at a simple but time-consuming project in five- to fifteen-minute daily increments.
- Examples:
  - Decluttering your home
  - Packing for a move
  - Organizing your paperwork
  - Studying for an exam
  - Completing a time-consuming homework assignment
  - Reading a difficult book
- When you tell yourself a task "only" takes 5 minutes of your time, it's easier to convince yourself to get started.

### The Psychology of Habit Stacking

- "I often don't feel motivated."
- Motivation alone doesn't work, there is a concept called ego depletion, which is a person's diminished capacity to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and actions.
- People don't achieve peak results with a task because of of motivation. Instead, the number of decisions and completed tasks ultimately determine their level of success with a new task.
- **You have a finite amount of willpower, and you have the same stock of willpower for all manner of tasks.**

- "I can't remember to complete many small actions."
- People usually remember to brush their teeth since they are anchored to a larger routine, and it's an automatic action.
- Since tracking expenditures isn't anchored to an existing routine, it's hard to think devote time for it.

### Solution: Use Habit Stacking

- No need to remember each small action since it's written down and part of an established routine.
- Since they are simple actions, you just remember that each action is a prompt for the next one.
- You can add or subtract actions based on what you need to do that day.

#### Small Actions

- Writing a book: If you write 300 words/20 minutes, if you commit everyday, you can produce 9000 words in a month.
- Losing weight: Food log to have accountability. When you know you have to record everything, you'll skip the occasional sweet.
- Career: Write down the highest impact thing on a Post-It note.
- Sales numbers: Sort by priority.
- Dates: Start a conversation with a new person every day. You can be rejected, but this will give you an increased level of confidence when talking to new people.
