## High Performance Habits

### Introduction

- Why are you so terrified to want more? Maybe because I'm scared to go to the next level, because I'm barely surviving this one.
- The world cares less about your strengths and personality than about your service and meaningful contributions to others.
- Baseline before: Work hard, play by the rules. At some point, it became work hard, break the rules.
- Everything feels chaotic. Your work isn't as simple as it used to be.
- Mortality motivation: "Life is precious beyond words, and when you get a second chance, take a moment to define who you really are and what you really want. I realized I didn't want to take my life, I wanted to live. MY heart had been broken, but I wanted to love. I wanted to make my second chance matter, to make a difference. **Live. Love. Matter.**
- I read all the self-help books. I took psychology classes. I listened to the motivational audio programs. I wanted to the personal development seminars, and I followed they all espoused: I worked hard. I was passionate. I focused on my strengths. I practiced. I stuck to it. I was grateful on the journey. It worked.

#### High Performance Lessons

- Why do some individuals and teams succeed more quickly than others and sustain that success over the long term?
- Of those who pull it off, why are some miserable and others happy on their journey?
- What motivates people to reach for higher levels of success in the first place, and what kinds of habits, training, and support help them improve faster?
- With the right habits, anyone can dramatically increase results and become a high performer in almost any field of endeavor. Figuring what habits matter most is how you can set up practices that strengthen and sustain these habits.
- Move the central question from "How do I achieve more?" to "How would I like to live?" We do not want achievement for achievement's sake. This is about realigning your thoughts and behaviors so you can experience growth, well-being, and fulfillment as you strive.
- Certainty is the fool's dream. This blinds you, sets false or fixed limits, and creates "automatic" habits that become predictable bad thinking and openings for your competitors to pass you.
- Too many people are checking in to all the apps and stats and are still losing touch with their real ambitions and soul.
- High performance isn't just being good at a singular task or skill--she or he has learned adjacent competencies to complement a particular expertise. Quarterbacks: football, mental toughness, nutrition, self-discipline, team leadership, strength and conditioning, contract negotiations, brand building.
- You can't beat the norms if you've driven yourself to the ground. Part of sustained success is due to their healthy approach to living.
- **It's not about achievement in a profession or in just one area of interests, but it's also about creating a high performance life, in which you experience an ongoing feeling of full engagement, joy, and confidence that comes from being your best self.**
- This isn't about the 10,000 hours thing. People have personal strengths, but they destroy their health in their quest for success and thus can't maintain high performance.

#### What We Know About High Performers

- **High performers are more successful than their peers, yet they are less stressed.** You can live an extraordinary life that is far different from the battle that most people endure as they fight for survival.
- **High performers love challenges and are more confident that they will achieve their goals despite adversity.** High performers look forward to trying new things and they believe in their abilities to figure things out.
- **High performers are healthier than their peers.** 40% more likely to exercise 3 times a week.
- **High performers are happy.**
- **High performers are admired.** To become a high performer, ego takes a backseat to service. High performers have mastered the art of influencing others in such a way that others feel respected, valued, and appreciated, and are more likely to become high performers themselves.
- **High performers get better grades and are more likely to be CEOs.**
- **High performers work passionately regardless of traditional rewards.** High performers work hard not because of money, but because of something called necessity. Not for compensation, accolades, or bonuses, but for the meaning. High performers will always indicate that they feel well rewarded regardless of income level. They also rarely feel their work is "thankless" or that others don't appreciate how hard they work.
- **High performers are assertive (for the right reasons).** They jump into experiences and express themselves, not to conquer or to compete, but because of a habit of courage in sharing new ideas, engaging in complex conversations, expressing their real thoughts and dreams, and standing up for themselves. They speak up for others and champion other people's ideas more often.
- **High performers see and serve beyond their strengths.** "Who am I and what am I good at?" "What is required to be of service here, and how can I grow into that or lead others to deliver that?"
- **High performers are uniquely productive--they've mastered prolific quality output.**
- **High performers are adaptive servant leaders.** High performers don't think, live, or practice in a vacuum. They're influencing people and adding value to those around them, not just trying to win spelling bees or chess matches. You can put them in any context, any team, any company, any industry, and they would win--not because they're geniuses or lone wolves, but because they positively influence others to rise.

#### The Habits of High Performance

- Habits are created when we do something so many times that it becomes almost automatic.
- The habits that really matter in high performance are not unconscious. They don't become automatic or easier with time, because the world gets more complex as you seek greater success.
- **When you knock on the door of opportunity, do not be surprised that it is Work who answers.**
- **In improving your life, ease is not the point, growth is the point.** Real success doesn't come from doing what's natural, certain, convenient or automatic.
- **Often, the journey to greatness begins the moment our preferences for comfort and certainty are overruled by a greater purpose that requires challenge and contribution.**

#### Permission Granted

- People who say "Why can't you just be happy with what you have?" don't understand high performers. You can be wildly happy with what you have, and stills strive to grow and contribute. It's okay that you want more. Don't fear your new ambitions. Just understand how to reach for them with more focus, elegance, and satisfaction that you did last time.
- **To succeed, always remember that the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.** In this book, the main thing is to teach you the habits that will make you extraordinary.

## The Quest for High Performance

- Life coaching:
  - Asking the client questions about what he wanted, and what "limiting beliefs" got in the way. Also questions about the past, trying to spot any events that might be influencing current behaviors.
  - Assessment tools.
  - Performance reviews from work and talk to the people around the client, using 360-degree assessments to figure out how others perceived them and what others wanted from them.
  - Actual output/past results to see what stood out.

#### The HP6

- **Seek clarity** on who you want to be, how you want to interact with others, what you want, and what will bring you the greatest meaning. "What kind of person do I want to be while I'm doing this? How should I treat others? What are my intentions and objectives? What can I focus on that will bring me a sense of connection and fulfillment?"
- **Generate energy** so that you can maintain focus, effort, and well-being. To stay on your A game, you'll need to actively care for your mental stamina, physical energy, and positive emotions in very specific ways.
- **Raise the necessity** for exceptional performance. This means actively tapping into the reasons you absolutely must perform well.
- **Increase productivity in your primary field of interest.** Your prolific quality output (PQO) must be high. You have to minimize distractions that steal your attention from creating PQO.
- **Develop influence** with those around you. It will make you better at getting people to believe in and support your efforts and ambitions.
- **Demonstrate courage** by expressing your ideas, taking bold action, and standing up for yourself and others.
- No "focus on your strengths" here. "Natural" birth strengths are not enough. It's about you rising to serve a mission, not the mission bowing down to match your limited strengths.
- Deliberate focus: really important.
- What you're innately good at is less important than how you choose to see the world, develop yourself, lead others, and remain persistent through difficulty.
- High performance is not about a specific type of person. It's about your performance habits, which you have complete control over.
- Lame excuses:
  - "I don't have the personality (I'm not extroverted, intuitive, charismatic, open, conscientious)."
  - "I'm just not the smartest."
  - "I'm not naturally gifted like they are."
  - "I'm not a right-brained person."
  - "I don't have enough experience."
  - "I'm a woman, black man, etc. and that's why I'm not succeeding."
  - "My company culture doesn't support me."
  - "I'd be better if they paid me what I'm really worth."
- Imagine how ridiculous it would be to tell people "If you could just improve your personality for us". These are simply not useful categories to focus on.

#### High Performance State of Mind?

- Full engagement, joy, and confidence. They tend to be fully immersed in what they're doing, they enjoy what they're doing, and they have the confidence in their ability to figure things out.
- Purposefulness and flow (being in the zone). Determination, focus, intention, deliberateness, and conscientiousness.
- Start with the end in mind. Start bringing your full attention to the moments in your life. Start bringing more joy, start bringing more confidence.

## High Performance Habit #1: Seek Clarity

- "Have you ever felt like you're just going through the motions, for maybe just too long?"
- "I don't know what I want anymore."
- Like a lot of achievers, she has a list of goals, and she accomplishes most of them. But the truth is she doesn't know what will bring the vibrancy back into her life.
- If achievers are in trouble, they tend to march on like good soldiers. They're afraid to make sudden changes because the reality is that things are good. They just know in their gut that there is a another level, a different quality of life. But they feel deep uncertainty over changing what is already working.
- Internal chatter:
  - Is all the complexity I've created in my life even worth it?
  - Is this the right direction for my family and me at this stage of our lives?
  - Why am I starting to feel distracted?
  - Why am I not more confident at this point in my life?
- You start looking at the mountains you've climbed, and fear that you climbed too many of the wrong ones. Then you learn that what is achievable isn't always what's important.

### Clarity Basics

- Clarity is not a personality trait that some are blessed to have and others are not. You generate the clarity, you don't "have" it.
- Clarity is the child of careful thought and mindful experimentation. It comes from asking yourself questions continually and further refining your perspective on life. Who am I? What do I value? What are my strengths and weaknesses? What are my goals? What's my plan?
- Having a specific plan attached to your goals can more than double the likelihood of achieving a challenging goal.
- **The highest performers had a great ability to focus on the future and diving how they would achieve excellence.** They didn't just know who they were; but they consistently thought about who they wanted to be and how to become that. They didn't just know their strengths today; they knew what broader skill sets they would have to master in coming months and years to serve with excellence at the next level.

### Self

- Introspection vs intention. **High performers can articulate their future self with greater ease than others.** Tactically, this means they tend to have a faster and more thoughtful, confident response when I ask them, "If you could describe your ideal self in the future, the person you are trying to become, how would you describe that self?"
- The highest-performing clients report thinking about their ideal future self and engaging in activities related to that almost sixty minutes more per week than the lowest-scoring clients. If you see yourself as a great communicator in the future, you would not only be more likely to imagine scenarios of yourself speaking with others, but also spend more time doing so.
- High performers think about this more than others. Describing a future self: faster and in a more confident tone.
- Actively engaging in a trying to be that high performer.
- **Be more intentional about who you want to become. Have vision beyond your current circumstances. Imagine your best future self, and start acting like that person today.**
- "Live, love, matter": Did I live fully today? Did I love? Did I matter? I have bad days, but the nights that I can say yes to those questions are the nights I sleep best.
- Kate's three future words to describe herself: Alive, playful, grateful. Kate was generally confident, but she had stopped envisioning a future Kate to grow into.
- "How would my future self look, feel, and behave differently in those situations?"
- What are the words that would sum up who you are at your best in the future?

### Social

- High situational awareness and social intelligence, which helps them succeed and lead. In every situation that matters, they know who they want to be and how they want to interact with others.
- "How can I be a good person or leader in this upcoming situation? What will the other person need? What kind of mood and tone do I want to set?"
- High performers value being respected and appreciated. They want to be respected and they want to demonstrate respect with others.
- Behaviors that lead to divorce: being critical, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling feel so offensive because they smack of devaluing or disrespect.
- **High performers anticipate positive social interactions and they strive continuously and consistently to create them.**
- When it comes to their interactions with others, they don't just go on autopilot. They've thought about the big picture of their social life, too. They've thought about how they want to be performed--they think about their character and legacy.
- They are consistently wondering, "How do I want those I love and serve to remember me?"
- Imagine in advance your interactions with people and then live into those intentions each day. Because "one day" almost always means "never".
- When each person describes why they love and respect you, what would you want those words to be?

### Skills/Service

- Executives who score higher on the HPI tend to have more blocks of time already scheduled for learning than do their peers with lower scores. Online training, executive coaching, reading, mastery-oriented hobbies.
- They have built a curriculum for themselves and are actively engaged in learning.
- The desire to develop specific skill sets.
- **Primary field of interest.** They don't just say "music" and then try to learn all forms of music. They focus on skill building rather than casual exploration.
- My PFI: personal development. But a lot of people are like that. So I made a huge shift, I made marketing my PFI.
- So, email marketing and making videos. Featured video training on my blog. I have an online members' area and charge people money to access them.
- **Look into the future. Identify key skills. Obsessively develop those skills.** If you leave your growth to randomness, you'll always live in the land of mediocrity.
- PFI: read, practice, get a coach, go to a training?
- **How can I serve people with excellence and make an extraordinary contribution to the world?** When someone becomes disconnected from their future and their contribution to it, they underperform.
- What provides the most value to those you serve? High performers obsess about service: how to add value, inspire those around them, and make a difference. What matters now, and how can I deliver it?
  - Relevance: Remove things that don't matter anymore.
  - Differentiation: How can we make ourselves unique?
  - Excellence: How can I deliver beyond what's expected?

### Determine the Feeling You're After

- Emotions vs feelings: emotions are instinctive. A triggering event generates an emotional response like fear, amusement, sadness, anger, relief, or love. Emotion = reaction, feeling = interpretation.
- You can experience the sudden emotion of fear, but choose to feel centered. "Calming yourself down" means choosing a different feeling from the emotion that may have come up for you.
- **Before entering a performance situation, high performers think about what they want to feel regardless of what emotions might come up.**
- Emotions come and go, but feelings last, as they're often a result of thinking, which you have control over. Anger can be the emotion that comes up, but bitterness doesn't have to be a lifelong sentence.
- High performers generate the feelings they want rather than taking the emotions that land on them. When they say they are trying to get in the zone, what they mean is that they are trying to use their conscious attention to narrow their focus and FEEL in the zone. Flow is a feeling that they choose. It is summoned, not a lucky emotion that conveniently happens to show up just in time for kickoff.
- **Choose how you want to feel in each situation.** "What do I want to feel today? How do I define the meaning of the day so that I feel what I want to?"

### Define What's Meaningful

- Not every mountain is worth the climb. What differentiates high performers from others is their critical eye in figuring out what is going to be meaningful to their life experience. They spend more of their time doing things that they find meaningful, and this makes them happy.
- It is not want of strength that locks us into unlived lives, rather it is lack of a decisive cause, something worth striving for, an ambitious purpose that sets our hearts ablaze and our feet marching forward.
- Meaning:
  - Enjoying work tasks.
  - Alignment of personal values with the work.
  - Fulfillment from the outcomes of the work.
- Meaning:
  - Enthusiasm. Enthusiasm independently predicted life satisfaction, positive emotions, fewer negative emotions, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations, self-acceptance, purpose in life, engagement, positive relationships, meaning, and achievement.
  - Connection. People who become socially isolated report that their life has lost meaning. Social relationships are the most frequently reported sources of meaning in life. This is less about comfort than about challenge: high performers feel that their work has more meaning when they are in a peer group that challenges them. In their everyday life, they value being around inspiring people who push them to grow more than people who are just fun to be around.
  - Satisfaction. If what they are doing creates a sense of personal satisfaction, they feel that their life is more meaningful. Teasing out what "satisfaction" means to people is as difficult as finding out how they define "meaningful."
  - Coherence/"my life makes sense." The story of your life is comprehensible to you in some way.
- Passion + Growth + Contribution = Personal Satisfaction
- Often, the desire for things to make sense is more important to a high performer than autonomy and balance. They will put their own desire for control or work-life balance aside if they sense that what they are doing makes sense and adds to a greater whole.
- **You need to bring more conscious and consistent thought to what you will find meaningful in life.** When you learn the difference between busywork and your life's work, that's the first step on the path of purpose.

### Putting It All Together

- You have to have a vision for yourself in the future. You have to discern how you want to feel and what will be meaningful to you. Without those practices, you have nothing to dream of and strive for, no pop and zest in your daily life propelling you forward.

## High Performance Habit #2: Generate Energy

- Drugs: When people want the edge, often the first place they look is outside themselves.
- Mental and physical energy. Lower energy means lower perception of your success, lower confidence, lower degree of influence over others.
- Married people have more energy than their never married counterparts.

### Release Tension, Set Intention

- Master transitions. (Waking up, transitioning from family time to drive time, solitary time to working with others).
- In a day:
  - Waking up, drinking water and coffee, making fried rice.
  - Read self-help things. Riding the bike and taking a shower.
  - Programming.
  - Eating my dinner/lunch, then drinking a coffee again.
  - Programming/reading.
  - Gym again.
  - Read, review day.
  - Sleep.
- Transitioning:
  - Repeat the word "release" in your mind over and over. As you do, command the body to release all the tension in your shoulders, in your back, and in your face and jaw.
  - When you have released some tension, SET INTENTION. Think about what you want to feel and achieve in the next activity you're about to take on when you open your eyes.
  - I do this before and after workouts, before I pick the phone to call someone, before I write an email to my team, before I shoot a video, before I get out of the car and go to lunch with friends, before I walk onto a stage.
  - Release tension, set intention.

### Bring the Joy

- Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. - Lincoln
- If you decide to set one intention that will raise your energy and change your life more than any other, make it to bring more joy into your daily life. Joy cues almost every other positive human emotion we desire in life.
- Positive emotion is one of the greatest predictors of the good life--high energy and high performance. People with more positive emotion have more satisfying marriages, make more money, and have better health. Positive emotions prompt new cell growth, whereas negative emotions cause decay.
- High performers don't always enjoy all the hard work that goes into becoming great, but they are grateful and giddy about their craft and their opportunities overall. Show up and bring the joy.
- High performers:
  -  Prime the emotions they want to experience, in advance of key events. They think about how they want to feel, and ask themselves questions, or practice visualizations that generate those feelings.
  - Anticipate positive outcomes from their actions. They're optimistic and clearly believe that their actions will be rewarded.
  - Imagine possible stressful situations and how their best self might gracefully handle them. As much as they anticipate positive outcomes, they're realistic about hitting snags, and they prepare themselves for difficulties.
  - They seek to insert appreciation, surprise, wonder, and challenge into their day.
  - They steer social interactions toward positive emotions and experiences. They are what one respondent calls "conscious goodness spreaders."
  - They reflect regularly on all that they're grateful for.
- I ask three questions to prime my mind for a positive day:
  - What can I be excited about today? If you can't think of anything then make something up, lol.
  - What or who might trip me up or cause stress, and how can I respond in a positive way, from my highest self?
  - Who can I surprise today with a thank-you, a gift, or a moment of appreciation?
- Self-coaching: like seeing yourself stressed in a meeting but fixing it anyway.
- You can put words and phrases in your phone to remind yourself of who you want to be and how you want to interact with others. When your phone vibrates, you look at it, right? So might as well look at something that has a positive impact. "Bring the joy."
- Door frame trigger: Every time I walk through a doorway, "I will find the good in this room."
- Waiting trigger. "What level of presence do I feel right now?"
- Touch trigger. Whenever I'm introduced to someone, they get a hug.
- Gift trigger. Whenever something positive happens, I say "What a gift!"
- Stress trigger. Stress is self-created, so I decided to stop manufacturing it. What's the positive thing that I can focus on and the next right action of integrity I should take now?
- Gratitude: gratitude is the golden frame though which we see the meaning of life.
- **You can't just react well to life, you have to generate joy in it.**
- How would my best self handle this situation?
- You are on this planet for this woman. Bring joy to her life.

### Optimize Health

- When people are unhealthy, it's not because they don't know how to be healthy. We all know what to do to increase our physical energy, because by now it's common sense: exercise, food, sleep.
- "Everyone in my industry works this hard, so I have to cut out something somewhere." Then why cut health?
- Fifty years of sleep research isn't wrong re: proper duration of sleep leading to higher cognitive scores, less stress, higher life satisfaction, better health, more productivity, more profitability, and less conflict.
- So if the demands of your job or life require you to learn fast, deal with stress, be alert, pay attention, remember important things, and keep a positive mood, then you MUST take exercise more seriously.
- Beware of using meals as a way to push down negative emotions. If you feel bad, MOVE. Go for a walk and change your emotional state before eating.

## High Performance Habit #3: Raise Necessity

- Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason, mastery demands all of a person.
- "There is no point--unless you choose to make one. Either the point of your pain is to say to the world, 'This is how I've chosen to deal with this: by giving up.' Or the point is to show yourself, your fellow Marines, and the world that nothing will stop you or the spirit of service in you."
- You don't have to get better, or you choose that you must get better. It's up to you. One choice sucks and makes your life miserable forever. The other gets you out of bed.
- Performance necessity: we don't really have to do this things, we can live ordinary lives, but why do we do this?
- Necessity is the emotional drive that makes great performance a must instead of a preference. Unlike weaker desires that make you want to do something, necessity demands that you take action.
- You get things done, because you have to. There' not much choice; your heart and soul and the needs of the moment are telling you to act. It just feels right to do something. And if you didn't do it, you'd feel bad about yourself. You'd feel as though you weren't living up to your standards, meeting your obligations, or fulfilling your duties or your destiny.
- **"People need me now, they're counting on me. I can't miss this opportunity. If I don't do this now, I'll regret it forever."**
- You cannot become extraordinary without a sense that it's absolutely necessary to excel. You must get more emotionally committed to what you're doing, and reach that point where success is not an occasional preference but a soul-deep necessity.

### Necessity Basics

- "Whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do it well; whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely."
- Internal forces: the feelings of being frustrated or happy with your performance. Our values, our expectations, our dreams, our goals, our need for safety, belonging, congruence, growth.

### High Personal Standards and Commitment to Excellence

- The quality of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor.
- High standard, regardless if you choose the task or if you enjoy the task. You may hate this workout but you recognize that you need to do it to get better.
- You want to set challenging goals that mean something to them personally.
- **High performers care even more about excellence and thus put more effort into their activities than others do.** They check in several times throughout the day to see whether they are living up to those standards.
- **People who set goals and regularly self-monitor are almost two and a half times more likely to attain their goals. They also develop more accurate plans and feel more motivated to follow through on them.**
- They feel they're on the right path because they frequently check in with themselves.
- Most high performers find them more than willing to face their faults and address their weaknesses. They don't avoid the conversation. They don't pretend to be perfect. They want to talk about how to improve, because at their core, their identity and enjoyment in life are tied to growth.
- **When your identity says, "I'm someone who gets things done and does them with excellence", or "I'm a successful person who cares a bout the details and how things turn out", then you care when things go sideways.**
- Choking is surprisingly rare for high performers because they're so used to dealing with high necessity.
- Sometimes, the fastest way to get back in the game is to expect something from yourself again. Tie your identity to doing a good job. Remember to set challenging goals. Better to set difficult and specific goals than vague and non-challenging goals.
- They make their dream a necessity. Their future identity it tied to it, they expect themselves to make it happen, and so they do.

### Obsession with Understanding and Mastering a Topic

- If a standard for excellence makes solid performance necessary, then the internal force of curiosity makes it enjoyable.
- High intrinsic motivation: they do things because those things are interesting, enjoyable, and personally satisfying.
- Grit is combined passion and perseverance. It matters how long you focus on and train for something. People who become world-class at anything focus longer and harder on their craft.
- **Our challenge is that we have been conditioned to believe the opposite of these things—that bold action or swift progress is somehow dangerous or reckless. But a certain degree of insanity and recklessness is necessary to advance or innovate anything, to make any new or remarkable or meaningful contributions. What great thing was ever accomplished without a little recklessness? So-called recklessness was required for the extraordinary to happen: crossing the oceans, ending slavery, rocketing man into space, building skyscrapers, decoding the genome, starting new businesses, and innovating entire industries. It is reckless to try something that has never been done, to move against convention, to begin before all conditions are good and preparations are perfected. But the bold know that to win, one must first begin. They also deeply understand that a degree of risk is inevitable and necessary should there be any real reward. Yes, any plunge into the unknown is reckless—but that’s where the treasure lies.**
- When you are passionate about what you do, people understand. When you are obsessed, they think you're mad. That's the difference.
- You know within minutes of meeting someone whether they have an obsession. If they have it, they're curious, engaged, excited to learn and talk about something specific and deeply important to them. They say things like "I love doing what I do so much, I'm sort of obsessed." Or, "I live, eat, and breathe this; I can't imagine doing something else, this is who I am."
- The moment you know that something has transcended being a passion and has become an obsession is when that something gets tied to your identity.
- Obsession is not something to fear. It is a badge of honor. When people are obsessed with something, they enjoy doing it so much that they don't feel the need to apologize to others for it. They lose hours working at a task or improving a skill. And they love it.
- What is normal: normal is being distracted. If an abnormal amount of focus is "unhealthy", then high performers are guilty as charged. But think about it. This wouldn't be unhealthy because if it is, then they wouldn't be high performers.
- That's why I encourage people to keep experimenting in life until they find something that sparks unusual interest.

### External Forces

- External demands don't correlate to a strong performance. If they do feel pressure from others, it just reinforces choices or behaviors they may have already have committed to.
- "Positive" external forces are causal reasons for increased performance. Even obligations and difficult-to-meet deadlines are viewed as positive performance enhancers.
- Duty: people tend to maintain motivation if they are held accountable for their outcomes, are evaluated more often, and have the opportunity to demonstrate their expertise or gain respect from those they serve.
- **If you owe it to someone to do well, and you feel that doing well will exhibit your expertise, then you'll feel greater necessity to perform at high levels.**
- Even if parents hate waking up to change a diaper, adherence to meeting that "positive" obligation helps make them feel like good parents, which is at least part of what motivates them to do it.
- At work, a sense of "doing the right thing" drives positive emotions and performance as well. Employees who are the most committed feel that it would be "wrong" to leave a company if their absence would hurt the company's future.
- Don't get pulled into fake urgencies/doing what really matters when it matters.
- If I didn't finish this book, my family would mutiny, my friends would abduct me, and my publisher would dump me. When there was a real deadline, the words per hour increased exponentially.
- Real deadlines: are inherently social. They recognize that their timeliness affects other people.
- If people feel like they aren't as consistent or as disciplined as they should be, you can ask them about necessity.

### Know Who Needs Your Game

- I've never met a high performer who didn't consistently ponder whether they were giving their best, and not just for themselves but for others. They have come to assess your performance at regular intervals.
  - Dabblers: passing interest in life.
  - Novices: more intent on developing an expertise, but they stop at obstacles.
  - Amateurs have passion, but they need external validation.
  - Players: greater commitment and skill, as long as they get their turn and get compensation. If the game changes, they're quickly embittered.
  - High performers: All-in, high level no matter the recognition or rewards, because the game is intrinsically rewarding and also part of how they view their service to the world. Don't mind sharing the spotlight. High degree of personal excellence and duty to the team.
- You need to immerse yourself fully in activities that force you to stretch. You have to put yourself in situations that make you feel good.

### Affirm the Why

- Confidently affirming their goals to themselves and others.
- To affirm is to declare or assert something as valid or confirmed. It is saying with confidence that something is true or will happen.
- Doesn't matter if extrovert or introvert.
- While they are exuberant in sharing their whys with others, they rarely declare that their approach is always right. They just want to make sure that their approach is the best one available.
- If you tell something can be done, it will be done. There are social stakes. I promised that something was going to happen, and if it doesn't, then I didn't meet my promise. I didn't keep my word. I risk looking like a fool or like something lacking integrity, neither of which I want.
- "You're doing this because it's important. You can inspire them and help them reach their goals. That's your purpose. Do good for them."
- Base things on intrinsic rewards (helping people and loving the process), rather than on intrinsic rewards (making money, awards, feedback). Not all affirmations are created equal--intrinsic ones are stronger.
- **When those with anxiety disorders find the courage to overcome their symptoms, the strategy they list most commonly is to remind themselves of the value of the goals they are after.**

### Level Up Your Squad

- Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life.
- It's not just about increasing time with your current squad, but adding new people to the squad as well.
- The people around you affect how much you sleep, the food that you eat, and how much money you spend or save.
- Smoking, obesity, loneliness, depression, divorce, and drug use tend to grow in social clusters.
- The belief that you can improve with effort. Turns out this is important.
- You want to be strategic re: working with others at or above their level of competence, experience, or overall success.
- Remember: people have bad days, and a lot of their attitude toward you has nothing to do with you. They're in their own world and going through difficulties.
- No other choice: "I was hungry. I had to succeed. There was no other choice."
- You have to be deliberate about raising your level of necessity.
  - Why is chasing this dream so important to me? Why must I do this? When must I do it? How can I get around more amazing people who up my game and help me serve at the next level? These questions, frequently revisited, can be the prompts for an entirely new level of commitment and drive.

## Increase Productivity

- "Don't think about making art, just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art."
- One of the worst feelings in the world is to be incredibly busy but feel that you're not making any progress.
- Sometimes, being effective isn't enough because achievement can be hollow if it gets out of sync with who you are, what you really want to be doing, what you're actually capable off.
- If you feel you are more productive, you are more likely to feel better, successful, and more confident. You're also more likely to take better care of yourself, get promoted more often, and earn more than people who feel less productive.
- Basics:
  - Setting goals and maintaining energy and focus.
  - Happy people aren't just more productive, they also receive higher evaluations for quality of work, dependability, and creativity. **Even just watching a comedy clip to bring some joy into your life before doing serious work can increase productivity.**
- You can spend time at the start of the week planning the rest of the week.
- Health, family, friends, intimate relationship, mission/work, finances, adventure, hobby, spirituality, emotion.
- You'll always feel out of balance if you're doing work that you don't find engaging and meaningful.
- Intermittent breaks throughout the day. Everyone gets tired.
- Transitioning: this does not include email, texts, social media. Checking in is the opposite of our goal which is to check out.
- The two-minute physical routine of calisthenics/Qi Gong/yoga paired with deep breathing.

### Increase the Outputs that Matter

- Prolific quality output. They aim their attention and consistent efforts towards PQO and minimize any distractions that would steal them away from their craft.
- What is relevant PQO?
  - Blogger: frequent and better content.
  - Parent: great experiences with the kids.
- You want to create things that matter. You want to know that a good day's work produces something worthwhile, something that will be part of your important contributions to others and the world, something that shows you care about your craft.
- If I'm going to be a real writer, then my productive output needed to become books.
- If I'm going to be a professional speaker, then my PQO would be the number of paid speaking gigs at a certain booking fee.
- If I'm going to be an online course trainer, then my PQO would be curriculum, training videos, and full online courses.
- I just put more effort into creating and promoting online courses.
- You want to quickly discover what output you should be creating. You want 60% of your workweek oriented to PQO.
- 60% writing, creating curriculum, filming videos. 40% strategy, team management, industry relationships, and customer engagement, which includes social media and communicating with students.
- Common excuses (delusions?): procrastination and perfectionism.
  - What the hell is procrastination? It's not even a personality trait. It's not poor time management. It's a motivational problem. Because you're not working on things that intrinsically matter to you. It can be a bout anxiety or fear of failure, but far more often it stems from working on things that don't excite you, engage you, or matter to you.
  - This is why you need your PQOs. If you love what you're creating or contributing in the world, you'll experience less procrastination.
  - Perfectionism: just a delay logic fancied up to look respectable. THEY RARELY EVEN BEGIN. A true perfectionist would have at least completed and released their work, since the very act of perfecting something comes only after it is completed, released, and them improved on.

### Chart Your Five Moves

- Distraction: not the lazy kind. When you start making moves with no unifying power, you just achieve little things, not big, meaningful things.
- When goals or projects are complex, planning always improves performance.
- If there were only five major moves to make that goal happen, what would they be?
- Being a best-selling author:
  - Interviewing several number one best-selling authors and deconstructing their major activities.
  - Find successful people and discover their five moves.
  - Learnings:
    - Hard work/discipline, not about the idealism of "being a writer".
    - Writers' conferences = not a factor.
    - No talk about focus groups.
    - Years of research = not really a determining factor.
    - Few mentioned major media coverage.
  - Actual steps:
    - Finish writing a good book. Until that's done, nothing else matters.
    - To get a major publishing deal, get an agent, or just self-publish.
    - Start blogging and posting to social media, and use these to get an e-mail list of subscribers. E-mail is everything.
    - Create a book promotion web page and offer some awesome bonuses to get people to buy the book. Bonuses are critical.
    - Get 5-10 people with huge e-mail lists to promote your book. You will promote them later.

### Get Insanely Good at Key Skills

- Everything is trainable. No matter what skill you want to learn, you can become more proficient at it.
- When people say, "I can't", it's usually code for "I am unwilling to do the long-term training and conditioning necessary to achieve that."
- Psychology, philosophy, and self-help. For most authors, something happened to them that inspired them to improve their life, explore how to become a better person, and want to help others on that journey.
- Progressive mastery:
  - Determine a skill that you want to master.
  - Set specific stretch goals on your path to improving that skill.
  - Attach high levels of emotion and meaning to your journey and your results.
  - Identify the factors critical to success.
  - Develop visualizations that clearly imagine what success and failure look like.
  - Schedule challenging practices.
  - Measure your progress and get outside feedback.
  - Socialize your learning and efforts by practicing or competing with others.
  - Continue setting higher-level goals so that you keep improving.
  - Teach others what you are learning.
- Progressive mastery:
  - Getting a coach.
  - Challenging yourself beyond your comfort zone.
  - Developing a mental representation of what success should be.
  - Tracking your progress.
  - Fixing your weaknesses.
- Emotion, socialization, teaching.
  - You are more strategic and disciplined in how you attach emotion to your journey, enhance your capabilities by training or competing with others, and use the power of teaching to discover greater insights into your own craft.
- Ex: swimming.
  - You determined that you specifically wanted to develop your skill as a freestyle swimmer.
  - You set goals for how fast and efficiently you entered the water, swam a lap, executed a turn, and finished  your last ten meters.
  - Before every practice, you reminded yourself why it was so important for you to get better at this, and you talked about your goals with someone who cared about your performance.
  - You determine that a critical factor to success was your ability to work y our hips efficiently in the water and that your major weakness was a lack of finishing stamina.
  - Every night, you visualized the perfect race, imagining in detail how you would move through the water, kick off the turn, power through failure, go for it in the lat few strokes.
  - Worked with an expert swim coach.
  - Measured your progress in a journal every time you swam.
  - Consistently swimming with people better than you, and entering competitions so you could face better swimmers than you.
  - Higher goals for the next session.
  - Once per week, you formally mentored another swimmer on your team or taught a swim class.
- "Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone."

## Develop Influence

- You can't influence a person in any useful way by diminishing them or putting out the fire in their belly. People only like to work with leaders who make them think bigger and grow more.
- You have to make people rise and meet a higher ambition with you.
- No effect on influence:
  - A sense of giving.
  - Creativity.
- What matters: Your perception of yourself. **If you believe that your peers view you as a successful, high performing person, naturally you believe yourself to be more influential. But it's just not about perception.**
- More influence really does equal a better life.
- Personality does not correlate with "political skill", which is how researchers refer to influence or your ability to understand others and get them to act towards objectives.

### Influence Basics

- **Ask.** Part of gaining influence is learning to make a lot requests and getting better at making those requests.
  - You can ask people more than once. The more you ask and share your ideas, the more people become familiar and comfortable with your requests, and the more they start to like the idea.
  - Asking isn't just about making requests to get what you want. If you seek greater influence with other people, learn to ask them a tremendous number of questions that elicit what they think, feel, want, need, and aspire to.
  - Great leaders ask a lot of questions. Remember, people support what they create. **When people get to contribute ideas, they have mental skin in the game.**
  - What do you want, how they'd like to work together, and what outcomes they care about.
- **Give.** Trust, autonomy, and decision-making authority. Researchers call this giving someone authorship, meaning they get to choose what to work on or how to get things done.
- **Be a champion of people.**
  - Becoming someone's champion: find out what your people are passionate about, and cheer on their good ideas. Be excited for people when they do a good job, and publicly praise them.

### The Difference Makers

- Influence actions:
  - They shape how we think.
  - They challenge us in some way.
  - They serve as role models.

### Teach People How to Think

- Make this thing more deliberate: "think of it this way", "what do you think about", "what would happen if we tried".
- When people complain, we can direct their thinking. What did she think of herself while doing the work, etc.
- People should be thinking of themselves as individual contributors, about their competitors, and about the overall marketplace.
- How do you want people to think about themselves? How do you want them to think about other people? How do you want them to think about the world at large?
- Being self-reliant: "care for your brothers because they are all you have", "do your best", "be yourself", "treat people with respect", "be a good citizen", "follow your dreams".
- Most people are good and caring, it's just that when they're in a hurry, they could be oblivious, dismissive, or rude. Always give people the benefit of the doubt.
- People are doing the best they could and often just needed our help.

### Challenge People to Grow

- People who agree with "I respond to life's challenges rather than avoiding them or delaying", "I love trying to master new challenges", and "I'm confident I can achieve my goals despite obstacles or resistance" are generally high performers.
- "You could do better", "You're a better person than that", and "I expected more from you".
- Indirect challenges:
  - "How would your best self approach this situation?"
  - "Looking back, did you give it your all?"
  - "Are you bringing the best of you to this situation?"
  - "What values are you trying to embody when you did that?"
- Connection: they don't let bad behavior slide. Be explicit in your expectations for how people should treat each other.
  - "Listen to each other more." "Show each other more respect."

### Role Model The Way

- It's less about being Mother Theresa and more about "I'm going to demonstrate a specific behavior so that others will emulate that exact behavior, which will help us move toward a specific result."
- High performers do want to be perceived as good people and good role models, but that just makes them human. What makes them HP is their laser-focused intention on how they can act in a way that gets someone to improve who they are, or achieve a specific result.
- **There's just something magical that happens in our life when we let all the drama go and decide to ask how we can be role models again.**

## Demonstrate Courage

- Posting a video: an act of self-expression, but not courageous. Sharing ideas is a job, so you don't get a hug for your courage. Be satisfied with "great idea".
- HPs report taking action despite fear much more often than others do.
- Those who are more like to self-report high levels of courage are those who:
  - love mastering challenges,
  - perceive themselves as assertive,
  - perceive themselves as confident,
  - perceive themselves as high performers,
  - perceive themselves as more successful than their peers, and
  - are happy with their life overall.
- If your kids see that you are fearful of life, they'll feel it, and they'll model it. Demonstrating more courage is a gateway for our society to develop greater virtue.
- Not just about overcoming fear. The outcome is what you're after, and the outcome that happens matters a great deal.
- Courageous: all about the outcome. People consider an actin courageous only if it gets completed or ends in a good result.
- Just have a high bias towards action. HPs don't just face doubt/fear or rises in service to help someone. Action woke their heart, and their path was revealed. They didn't hope for an opportunity to do something one day, they acted. They know that hoping to achieve good things without taking action is like hoping for help without asking for it.
- Don't complain, just act. Study, get mentors, face your fears. Only when our fears become our growth plan have we stepped onto the path of mastery.
- **Think of future, more confident you.** If that guy showed up, what courageous action would that future self advise you to take away to change your life? How would your future self tell you to live?

### Honor the Struggle

- If we're ever going to develop the strength that courage requires, we'll have to get better at dealing with life's basic challenges. We'll have to stop getting so annoyed and start seeing the struggle as part of growing our character. We must learn to honor the struggle.
- To achieve excellence, you need hard work, discipline, routines that can become boring, continual frustrations that accompany learning, adversities that test every measure of our heart and soul, and above all, courage.
- If you're unwilling to anticipate or endure the inevitable struggles, mistakes, messes, and difficulties of life, then it's a rough road.
- **The struggle I'm now facing is necessary, and it's summoning me to show up, be strong, and use it to forge a better future for myself and my loved ones.**
- Facing the hardship and trying to learn can bring out the best from you.
- Accepting that difficult times will come allows you to wake up with a sense of realism and readiness, to anticipate problems and be prepared for them, to maintain calm when the winds of change might topple lesser leaders.
- When you feel overwhelmed, choose to go for a walk, focus on your breath, and consider the problem rather than avoid it. Look the problem in the eye and ask, "what is the right action for me to take right now?"
- Embracing the suck: You have to deal with it, face it, and will yourself to persevere and rise. You have to embrace the suck. In any area of your life, if you have the opportunity and blessing to serve, you don't complain about the effort involved.
- "You will make it through."

### Share your Truth and Ambitions

- Main motivation for humans: personal freedom.
- When we live our truth, then we are authentic, we are free.
- If someone believes in you and sees greatness in you, live up to their standards. But for anyone who doubts or diminishes you, forget about it. Don't bother trying to please them. Live a life that is yours. Don't seek the approval of the doubters.
- Some felt fearful of expressing their ambitions, because the people around them could feel bad about themselves.
- **The next level of performance begins at your next level of truth.**
- Don't minimize yourself so that you don't make others feel bad. It's not humility, it's lying about your real ambitions.
- The people who are in your life for the right reasons will listen to your truth. They'll applaud your ambition. They'll be happy to meet the person behind the face. They'll thank you for sharing, for being real, for trusting them. Trust others with your truth, and the golden values of real friendship and love reveal themselves like lost treasures.
- The simple conversations: "you know, I was thinking about starting X because I'd love to Y."
  - I was thinking about researching how to write a book, because I think I have a story worth telling.
  - I was thinking about hitting the gym every morning, because I'd love to feel more vital and alive.
  - I was thinking about starting to look for another job, because I'd love to feel more passionate and appreciated.
  - I was thinking about starting to cold-call some new coaches, because I'm ready to compete at a higher level.

### Find Someone to Fight For

- "She deserves better."
- I am not going to let my weak motivation or bad habits diminish the life of this woman who believed in me when everyone else thought I was crazy, the woman who bought me groceries, the woman who said "I love you."
- We will do more for others than for ourselves. And in doing something for others, we find our reason for courage, and our cause for focus and excellence.
- "She needed me. There was no other choice I could live with than to help her." "I didn't want them to suffer." "No one seemed to care, and there I was." "I wanted to do it for him; he would have wanted that."

### Courage through Complexity

- Trust in yourself and lean forward. The next level opens after your next courageous step.
- The kinds of courageous acts that you are proud of at the end of your life are those in which you faced uncertainty and real risk, with real stakes, when doing something for a cause or person beyond yourself, without any assurance of safety, reward, or success.
