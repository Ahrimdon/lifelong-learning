## High Performance Habits

### Introduction

- Why are you so terrified to want more? Maybe because I'm scared to go to the next level, because I'm barely surviving this one.
- The world cares less about your strengths and personality than about your service and meaningful contributions to others.
- Baseline before: Work hard, play by the rules. At some point, it became work hard, break the rules.
- Everything feels chaotic. Your work isn't as simple as it used to be.
- Mortality motivation: "Life is precious beyond words, and when you get a second chance, take a moment to define who you really are and what you really want. I realized I didn't want to take my life, I wanted to live. MY heart had been broken, but I wanted to love. I wanted to make my second chance matter, to make a difference. **Live. Love. Matter.**
- I read all the self-help books. I took psychology classes. I listened to the motivational audio programs. I wanted to the personal development seminars, and I followed they all espoused: I worked hard. I was passionate. I focused on my strengths. I practiced. I stuck to it. I was grateful on the journey. It worked.

#### High Performance Lessons

- Why do some individuals and teams succeed more quickly than others and sustain that success over the long term?
- Of those who pull it off, why are some miserable and others happy on their journey?
- What motivates people to reach for higher levels of success in the first place, and what kinds of habits, training, and support help them improve faster?
- With the right habits, anyone can dramatically increase results and become a high performer in almost any field of endeavor. Figuring what habits matter most is how you can set up practices that strengthen and sustain these habits.
- Move the central question from "How do I achieve more?" to "How would I like to live?" We do not want achievement for achievement's sake. This is about realigning your thoughts and behaviors so you can experience growth, well-being, and fulfillment as you strive.
- Certainty is the fool's dream. This blinds you, sets false or fixed limits, and creates "automatic" habits that become predictable bad thinking and openings for your competitors to pass you.
- Too many people are checking in to all the apps and stats and are still losing touch with their real ambitions and soul.
- High performance isn't just being good at a singular task or skill--she or he has learned adjacent competencies to complement a particular expertise. Quarterbacks: football, mental toughness, nutrition, self-discipline, team leadership, strength and conditioning, contract negotiations, brand building.
- You can't beat the norms if you've driven yourself to the ground. Part of sustained success is due to their healthy approach to living.
- **It's not about achievement in a profession or in just one area of interests, but it's also about creating a high performance life, in which you experience an ongoing feeling of full engagement, joy, and confidence that comes from being your best self.**
- This isn't about the 10,000 hours thing. People have personal strengths, but they destroy their health in their quest for success and thus can't maintain high performance.

#### What We Know About High Performers

- **High performers are more successful than their peers, yet they are less stressed.** You can live an extraordinary life that is far different from the battle that most people endure as they fight for survival.
- **High performers love challenges and are more confident that they will achieve their goals despite adversity.** High performers look forward to trying new things and they believe in their abilities to figure things out.
- **High performers are healthier than their peers.** 40% more likely to exercise 3 times a week.
- **High performers are happy.**
- **High performers are admired.** To become a high performer, ego takes a backseat to service. High performers have mastered the art of influencing others in such a way that others feel respected, valued, and appreciated, and are more likely to become high performers themselves.
- **High performers get better grades and are more likely to be CEOs.**
- **High performers work passionately regardless of traditional rewards.** High performers work hard not because of money, but because of something called necessity. Not for compensation, accolades, or bonuses, but for the meaning. High performers will always indicate that they feel well rewarded regardless of income level. They also rarely feel their work is "thankless" or that others don't appreciate how hard they work.
- **High performers are assertive (for the right reasons).** They jump into experiences and express themselves, not to conquer or to compete, but because of a habit of courage in sharing new ideas, engaging in complex conversations, expressing their real thoughts and dreams, and standing up for themselves. They speak up for others and champion other people's ideas more often.
- **High performers see and serve beyond their strengths.** "Who am I and what am I good at?" "What is required to be of service here, and how can I grow into that or lead others to deliver that?"
- **High performers are uniquely productive--they've mastered prolific quality output.**
- **High performers are adaptive servant leaders.** High performers don't think, live, or practice in a vacuum. They're influencing people and adding value to those around them, not just trying to win spelling bees or chess matches. You can put them in any context, any team, any company, any industry, and they would win--not because they're geniuses or lone wolves, but because they positively influence others to rise.

#### The Habits of High Performance

- Habits are created when we do something so many times that it becomes almost automatic.
- The habits that really matter in high performance are not unconscious. They don't become automatic or easier with time, because the world gets more complex as you seek greater success.
- **When you knock on the door of opportunity, do not be surprised that it is Work who answers.**
- **In improving your life, ease is not the point, growth is the point.** Real success doesn't come from doing what's natural, certain, convenient or automatic.
- **Often, the journey to greatness begins the moment our preferences for comfort and certainty are overruled by a greater purpose that requires challenge and contribution.**

#### Permission Granted

- People who say "Why can't you just be happy with what you have?" don't understand high performers. You can be wildly happy with what you have, and stills strive to grow and contribute. It's okay that you want more. Don't fear your new ambitions. Just understand how to reach for them with more focus, elegance, and satisfaction that you did last time.
- **To succeed, always remember that the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.** In this book, the main thing is to teach you the habits that will make you extraordinary.

## The Quest for High Performance

- Life coaching:
  - Asking the client questions about what he wanted, and what "limiting beliefs" got in the way. Also questions about the past, trying to spot any events that might be influencing current behaviors.
  - Assessment tools.
  - Performance reviews from work and talk to the people around the client, using 360-degree assessments to figure out how others perceived them and what others wanted from them.
  - Actual output/past results to see what stood out.

#### The HP6

- **Seek clarity** on who you want to be, how you want to interact with others, what you want, and what will bring you the greatest meaning. "What kind of person do I want to be while I'm doing this? How should I treat others? What are my intentions and objectives? What can I focus on that will bring me a sense of connection and fulfillment?"
- **Generate energy** so that you can maintain focus, effort, and well-being. To stay on your A game, you'll need to actively care for your mental stamina, physical energy, and positive emotions in very specific ways.
- **Raise the necessity** for exceptional performance. This means actively tapping into the reasons you absolutely must perform well.
- **Increase productivity in your primary field of interest.** Your prolific quality output (PQO) must be high. You have to minimize distractions that steal your attention from creating PQO.
- **Develop influence** with those around you. It will make you better at getting people to believe in and support your efforts and ambitions.
- **Demonstrate courage** by expressing your ideas, taking bold action, and standing up for yourself and others.
- No "focus on your strengths" here. "Natural" birth strengths are not enough. It's about you rising to serve a mission, not the mission bowing down to match your limited strengths.
- Deliberate focus: really important.
- What you're innately good at is less important than how you choose to see the world, develop yourself, lead others, and remain persistent through difficulty.
- High performance is not about a specific type of person. It's about your performance habits, which you have complete control over.
- Lame excuses:
  - "I don't have the personality (I'm not extroverted, intuitive, charismatic, open, conscientious)."
  - "I'm just not the smartest."
  - "I'm not naturally gifted like they are."
  - "I'm not a right-brained person."
  - "I don't have enough experience."
  - "I'm a woman, black man, etc. and that's why I'm not succeeding."
  - "My company culture doesn't support me."
  - "I'd be better if they paid me what I'm really worth."
- Imagine how ridiculous it would be to tell people "If you could just improve your personality for us". These are simply not useful categories to focus on.

#### High Performance State of Mind?

- Full engagement, joy, and confidence. They tend to be fully immersed in what they're doing, they enjoy what they're doing, and they have the confidence in their ability to figure things out.
- Purposefulness and flow (being in the zone). Determination, focus, intention, deliberateness, and conscientiousness.
- Start with the end in mind. Start bringing your full attention to the moments in your life. Start bringing more joy, start bringing more confidence.

## High Performance Habit #1: Seek Clarity

- "Have you ever felt like you're just going through the motions, for maybe just too long?"
- "I don't know what I want anymore."
- Like a lot of achievers, she has a list of goals, and she accomplishes most of them. But the truth is she doesn't know what will bring the vibrancy back into her life.
- If achievers are in trouble, they tend to march on like good soldiers. They're afraid to make sudden changes because the reality is that things are good. They just know in their gut that there is a another level, a different quality of life. But they feel deep uncertainty over changing what is already working.
- Internal chatter:
  - Is all the complexity I've created in my life even worth it?
  - Is this the right direction for my family and me at this stage of our lives?
  - Why am I starting to feel distracted?
  - Why am I not more confident at this point in my life?
- You start looking at the mountains you've climbed, and fear that you climbed too many of the wrong ones. Then you learn that what is achievable isn't always what's important.

### Clarity Basics

- Clarity is not a personality trait that some are blessed to have and others are not. You generate the clarity, you don't "have" it.
- Clarity is the child of careful thought and mindful experimentation. It comes from asking yourself questions continually and further refining your perspective on life. Who am I? What do I value? What are my strengths and weaknesses? What are my goals? What's my plan?
- Having a specific plan attached to your goals can more than double the likelihood of achieving a challenging goal.
- **The highest performers had a great ability to focus on the future and diving how they would achieve excellence.** They didn't just know who they were; but they consistently thought about who they wanted to be and how to become that. They didn't just know their strengths today; they knew what broader skill sets they would have to master in coming months and years to serve with excellence at the next level.

### Envision the Future Four

- Self.
  - Introspection vs intention. **High performers can articulate their future self with greater ease than others.** Tactically, this means they tend to have a faster and more thoughtful, confident response when I ask them, "If you could describe your ideal self in the future, the person you are trying to become, how would you describe that self?"
  - The highest-performing clients report thinking about their ideal future self and engaging in activities related to that almost sixty minutes more per week than the lowest-scoring clients. If you see yourself as a great communicator in the future, you would not only be more likely to imagine scenarios of yourself speaking with others, but also spend more time doing so.
