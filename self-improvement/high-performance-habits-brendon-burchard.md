## High Performance Habits

### Introduction

- Why are you so terrified to want more? Maybe because I'm scared to go to the next level, because I'm barely surviving this one.
- The world cares less about your strengths and personality than about your service and meaningful contributions to others.
- Baseline before: Work hard, play by the rules. At some point, it became work hard, break the rules.
- Everything feels chaotic. Your work isn't as simple as it used to be.
- Mortality motivation: "Life is precious beyond words, and when you get a second chance, take a moment to define who you really are and what you really want. I realized I didn't want to take my life, I wanted to live. MY heart had been broken, but I wanted to love. I wanted to make my second chance matter, to make a difference. **Live. Love. Matter.**
- I read all the self-help books. I took psychology classes. I listened to the motivational audio programs. I wanted to the personal development seminars, and I followed they all espoused: I worked hard. I was passionate. I focused on my strengths. I practiced. I stuck to it. I was grateful on the journey. It worked.

#### High Performance Lessons

- Why do some individuals and teams succeed more quickly than others and sustain that success over the long term?
- Of those who pull it off, why are some miserable and others happy on their journey?
- What motivates people to reach for higher levels of success in the first place, and what kinds of habits, training, and support help them improve faster?
- With the right habits, anyone can dramatically increase results and become a high performer in almost any field of endeavor. Figuring what habits matter most is how you can set up practices that strengthen and sustain these habits.
- Move the central question from "How do I achieve more?" to "How would I like to live?" We do not want achievement for achievement's sake. This is about realigning your thoughts and behaviors so you can experience growth, well-being, and fulfillment as you strive.
- Certainty is the fool's dream. This blinds you, sets false or fixed limits, and creates "automatic" habits that become predictable bad thinking and openings for your competitors to pass you.
- Too many people are checking in to all the apps and stats and are still losing touch with their real ambitions and soul.
- High performance isn't just being good at a singular task or skill--she or he has learned adjacent competencies to complement a particular expertise. Quarterbacks: football, mental toughness, nutrition, self-discipline, team leadership, strength and conditioning, contract negotiations, brand building.
- You can't beat the norms if you've driven yourself to the ground. Part of sustained success is due to their healthy approach to living.
- **It's not about achievement in a profession or in just one area of interests, but it's also about creating a high performance life, in which you experience an ongoing feeling of full engagement, joy, and confidence that comes from being your best self.**
- This isn't about the 10,000 hours thing. People have personal strengths, but they destroy their health in their quest for success and thus can't maintain high performance.

#### What We Know About High Performers

- **High performers are more successful than their peers, yet they are less stressed.** You can live an extraordinary life that is far different from the battle that most people endure as they fight for survival.
- **High performers love challenges and are more confident that they will achieve their goals despite adversity.** High performers look forward to trying new things and they believe in their abilities to figure things out.
- **High performers are healthier than their peers.** 40% more likely to exercise 3 times a week.
- **High performers are happy.**
- **High performers are admired.** To become a high performer, ego takes a backseat to service. High performers have mastered the art of influencing others in such a way that others feel respected, valued, and appreciated, and are more likely to become high performers themselves.
- **High performers get better grades and are more likely to be CEOs.**
- **High performers work passionately regardless of traditional rewards.** High performers work hard not because of money, but because of something called necessity. Not for compensation, accolades, or bonuses, but for the meaning. High performers will always indicate that they feel well rewarded regardless of income level. They also rarely feel their work is "thankless" or that others don't appreciate how hard they work.
- **High performers are assertive (for the right reasons).** They jump into experiences and express themselves, not to conquer or to compete, but because of a habit of courage in sharing new ideas, engaging in complex conversations, expressing their real thoughts and dreams, and standing up for themselves. They speak up for others and champion other people's ideas more often.
- **High performers see and serve beyond their strengths.** "Who am I and what am I good at?" "What is required to be of service here, and how can I grow into that or lead others to deliver that?"
- **High performers are uniquely productive--they've mastered prolific quality output.**
- **High performers are adaptive servant leaders.** High performers don't think, live, or practice in a vacuum. They're influencing people and adding value to those around them, not just trying to win spelling bees or chess matches. You can put them in any context, any team, any company, any industry, and they would win--not because they're geniuses or lone wolves, but because they positively influence others to rise.

#### The Habits of High Performance

- Habits are created when we do something so many times that it becomes almost automatic.
- The habits that really matter in high performance are not unconscious. They don't become automatic or easier with time, because the world gets more complex as you seek greater success.
- **When you knock on the door of opportunity, do not be surprised that it is Work who answers.**
- **In improving your life, ease is not the point, growth is the point.** Real success doesn't come from doing what's natural, certain, convenient or automatic.
- **Often, the journey to greatness begins the moment our preferences for comfort and certainty are overruled by a greater purpose that requires challenge and contribution.**

#### Permission Granted

- People who say "Why can't you just be happy with what you have?" don't understand high performers. You can be wildly happy with what you have, and stills strive to grow and contribute. It's okay that you want more. Don't fear your new ambitions. Just understand how to reach for them with more focus, elegance, and satisfaction that you did last time.
- **To succeed, always remember that the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.** In this book, the main thing is to teach you the habits that will make you extraordinary.

## The Quest for High Performance

- Life coaching:
  - Asking the client questions about what he wanted, and what "limiting beliefs" got in the way. Also questions about the past, trying to spot any events that might be influencing current behaviors.
  - Assessment tools.
  - Performance reviews from work and talk to the people around the client, using 360-degree assessments to figure out how others perceived them and what others wanted from them.
  - Actual output/past results to see what stood out.

#### The HP6

- **Seek clarity** on who you want to be, how you want to interact with others, what you want, and what will bring you the greatest meaning. "What kind of person do I want to be while I'm doing this? How should I treat others? What are my intentions and objectives? What can I focus on that will bring me a sense of connection and fulfillment?"
- **Generate energy** so that you can maintain focus, effort, and well-being. To stay on your A game, you'll need to actively care for your mental stamina, physical energy, and positive emotions in very specific ways.
- **Raise the necessity** for exceptional performance. This means actively tapping into the reasons you absolutely must perform well.
- **Increase productivity in your primary field of interest.** Your prolific quality output (PQO) must be high. You have to minimize distractions that steal your attention from creating PQO.
- **Develop influence** with those around you. It will make you better at getting people to believe in and support your efforts and ambitions.
- **Demonstrate courage** by expressing your ideas, taking bold action, and standing up for yourself and others.
- No "focus on your strengths" here. "Natural" birth strengths are not enough. It's about you rising to serve a mission, not the mission bowing down to match your limited strengths.
- Deliberate focus: really important.
- What you're innately good at is less important than how you choose to see the world, develop yourself, lead others, and remain persistent through difficulty.
- High performance is not about a specific type of person. It's about your performance habits, which you have complete control over.
- Lame excuses:
  - "I don't have the personality (I'm not extroverted, intuitive, charismatic, open, conscientious)."
  - "I'm just not the smartest."
  - "I'm not naturally gifted like they are."
  - "I'm not a right-brained person."
  - "I don't have enough experience."
  - "I'm a woman, black man, etc. and that's why I'm not succeeding."
  - "My company culture doesn't support me."
  - "I'd be better if they paid me what I'm really worth."
- Imagine how ridiculous it would be to tell people "If you could just improve your personality for us". These are simply not useful categories to focus on.

#### High Performance State of Mind?

- Full engagement, joy, and confidence. They tend to be fully immersed in what they're doing, they enjoy what they're doing, and they have the confidence in their ability to figure things out.
- Purposefulness and flow (being in the zone). Determination, focus, intention, deliberateness, and conscientiousness.
- Start with the end in mind. Start bringing your full attention to the moments in your life. Start bringing more joy, start bringing more confidence.

## High Performance Habit #1: Seek Clarity

- "Have you ever felt like you're just going through the motions, for maybe just too long?"
- "I don't know what I want anymore."
- Like a lot of achievers, she has a list of goals, and she accomplishes most of them. But the truth is she doesn't know what will bring the vibrancy back into her life.
- If achievers are in trouble, they tend to march on like good soldiers. They're afraid to make sudden changes because the reality is that things are good. They just know in their gut that there is a another level, a different quality of life. But they feel deep uncertainty over changing what is already working.
- Internal chatter:
  - Is all the complexity I've created in my life even worth it?
  - Is this the right direction for my family and me at this stage of our lives?
  - Why am I starting to feel distracted?
  - Why am I not more confident at this point in my life?
- You start looking at the mountains you've climbed, and fear that you climbed too many of the wrong ones. Then you learn that what is achievable isn't always what's important.

### Clarity Basics

- Clarity is not a personality trait that some are blessed to have and others are not. You generate the clarity, you don't "have" it.
- Clarity is the child of careful thought and mindful experimentation. It comes from asking yourself questions continually and further refining your perspective on life. Who am I? What do I value? What are my strengths and weaknesses? What are my goals? What's my plan?
- Having a specific plan attached to your goals can more than double the likelihood of achieving a challenging goal.
- **The highest performers had a great ability to focus on the future and diving how they would achieve excellence.** They didn't just know who they were; but they consistently thought about who they wanted to be and how to become that. They didn't just know their strengths today; they knew what broader skill sets they would have to master in coming months and years to serve with excellence at the next level.

### Self

- Introspection vs intention. **High performers can articulate their future self with greater ease than others.** Tactically, this means they tend to have a faster and more thoughtful, confident response when I ask them, "If you could describe your ideal self in the future, the person you are trying to become, how would you describe that self?"
- The highest-performing clients report thinking about their ideal future self and engaging in activities related to that almost sixty minutes more per week than the lowest-scoring clients. If you see yourself as a great communicator in the future, you would not only be more likely to imagine scenarios of yourself speaking with others, but also spend more time doing so.
- High performers think about this more than others. Describing a future self: faster and in a more confident tone.
- Actively engaging in a trying to be that high performer.
- **Be more intentional about who you want to become. Have vision beyond your current circumstances. Imagine your best future self, and start acting like that person today.**
- "Live, love, matter": Did I live fully today? Did I love? Did I matter? I have bad days, but the nights that I can say yes to those questions are the nights I sleep best.
- Kate's three future words to describe herself: Alive, playful, grateful. Kate was generally confident, but she had stopped envisioning a future Kate to grow into.
- "How would my future self look, feel, and behave differently in those situations?"
- What are the words that would sum up who you are at your best in the future?

### Social

- High situational awareness and social intelligence, which helps them succeed and lead. In every situation that matters, they know who they want to be and how they want to interact with others.
- "How can I be a good person or leader in this upcoming situation? What will the other person need? What kind of mood and tone do I want to set?"
- High performers value being respected and appreciated. They want to be respected and they want to demonstrate respect with others.
- Behaviors that lead to divorce: being critical, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling feel so offensive because they smack of devaluing or disrespect.
- **High performers anticipate positive social interactions and they strive continuously and consistently to create them.**
- When it comes to their interactions with others, they don't just go on autopilot. They've thought about the big picture of their social life, too. They've thought about how they want to be performed--they think about their character and legacy.
- They are consistently wondering, "How do I want those I love and serve to remember me?"
- Imagine in advance your interactions with people and then live into those intentions each day. Because "one day" almost always means "never".
- When each person describes why they love and respect you, what would you want those words to be?

### Skills/Service

- Executives who score higher on the HPI tend to have more blocks of time already scheduled for learning than do their peers with lower scores. Online training, executive coaching, reading, mastery-oriented hobbies.
- They have built a curriculum for themselves and are actively engaged in learning.
- The desire to develop specific skill sets.
- **Primary field of interest.** They don't just say "music" and then try to learn all forms of music. They focus on skill building rather than casual exploration.
- My PFI: personal development. But a lot of people are like that. So I made a huge shift, I made marketing my PFI.
- So, email marketing and making videos. Featured video training on my blog. I have an online members' area and charge people money to access them.
- **Look into the future. Identify key skills. Obsessively develop those skills.** If you leave your growth to randomness, you'll always live in the land of mediocrity.
- PFI: read, practice, get a coach, go to a training?
- **How can I serve people with excellence and make an extraordinary contribution to the world?** When someone becomes disconnected from their future and their contribution to it, they underperform.
- What provides the most value to those you serve? High performers obsess about service: how to add value, inspire those around them, and make a difference. What matters now, and how can I deliver it?
  - Relevance: Remove things that don't matter anymore.
  - Differentiation: How can we make ourselves unique?
  - Excellence: How can I deliver beyond what's expected?

### Determine the Feeling You're After

- Emotions vs feelings: emotions are instinctive. A triggering event generates an emotional response like fear, amusement, sadness, anger, relief, or love. Emotion = reaction, feeling = interpretation.
- You can experience the sudden emotion of fear, but choose to feel centered. "Calming yourself down" means choosing a different feeling from the emotion that may have come up for you.
- **Before entering a performance situation, high performers think about what they want to feel regardless of what emotions might come up.**
- Emotions come and go, but feelings last, as they're often a result of thinking, which you have control over. Anger can be the emotion that comes up, but bitterness doesn't have to be a lifelong sentence.
- High performers generate the feelings they want rather than taking the emotions that land on them. When they say they are trying to get in the zone, what they mean is that they are trying to use their conscious attention to narrow their focus and FEEL in the zone. Flow is a feeling that they choose. It is summoned, not a lucky emotion that conveniently happens to show up just in time for kickoff.
- **Choose how you want to feel in each situation.** "What do I want to feel today? How do I define the meaning of the day so that I feel what I want to?"

### Define What's Meaningful

- Not every mountain is worth the climb. What differentiates high performers from others is their critical eye in figuring out what is going to be meaningful to their life experience. They spend more of their time doing things that they find meaningful, and this makes them happy.
- It is not want of strength that locks us into unlived lives, rather it is lack of a decisive cause, something worth striving for, an ambitious purpose that sets our hearts ablaze and our feet marching forward.
- Meaning:
  - Enjoying work tasks.
  - Alignment of personal values with the work.
  - Fulfillment from the outcomes of the work.
- Meaning:
  - Enthusiasm. Enthusiasm independently predicted life satisfaction, positive emotions, fewer negative emotions, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations, self-acceptance, purpose in life, engagement, positive relationships, meaning, and achievement.
  - Connection. People who become socially isolated report that their life has lost meaning. Social relationships are the most frequently reported sources of meaning in life. This is less about comfort than about challenge: high performers feel that their work has more meaning when they are in a peer group that challenges them. In their everyday life, they value being around inspiring people who push them to grow more than people who are just fun to be around.
  - Satisfaction. If what they are doing creates a sense of personal satisfaction, they feel that their life is more meaningful. Teasing out what "satisfaction" means to people is as difficult as finding out how they define "meaningful."
  - Coherence/"my life makes sense." The story of your life is comprehensible to you in some way.
- Passion + Growth + Contribution = Personal Satisfaction
- Often, the desire for things to make sense is more important to a high performer than autonomy and balance. They will put their own desire for control or work-life balance aside if they sense that what they are doing makes sense and adds to a greater whole.
- **You need to bring more conscious and consistent thought to what you will find meaningful in life.** When you learn the difference between busywork and your life's work, that's the first step on the path of purpose.

### Putting It All Together

- You have to have a vision for yourself in the future. You have to discern how you want to feel and what will be meaningful to you. Without those practices, you have nothing to dream of and strive for, no pop and zest in your daily life propelling you forward.

## High Performance Habit #2: Generate Energy

- Drugs: When people want the edge, often the first place they look is outside themselves.
- Mental and physical energy. Lower energy means lower perception of your success, lower confidence, lower degree of influence over others.
- Married people have more energy than their never married counterparts.

### Release Tension, Set Intention

- Master transitions. (Waking up, transitioning from family time to drive time, solitary time to working with others).
- In a day:
  - Waking up, drinking water and coffee, making fried rice.
  - Read self-help things. Riding the bike and taking a shower.
  - Programming.
  - Eating my dinner/lunch, then drinking a coffee again.
  - Programming/reading.
  - Gym again.
  - Read, review day.
  - Sleep.
- Transitioning:
  - Repeat the word "release" in your mind over and over. As you do, command the body to release all the tension in your shoulders, in your back, and in your face and jaw.
  - When you have released some tension, SET INTENTION. Think about what you want to feel and achieve in the next activity you're about to take on when you open your eyes.
  - I do this before and after workouts, before I pick the phone to call someone, before I write an email to my team, before I shoot a video, before I get out of the car and go to lunch with friends, before I walk onto a stage.
  - Release tension, set intention.

### Bring the Joy

- Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. - Lincoln
- If you decide to set one intention that will raise your energy and change your life more than any other, make it to bring more joy into your daily life. Joy cues almost every other positive human emotion we desire in life.
- Positive emotion is one of the greatest predictors of the good life--high energy and high performance. People with more positive emotion have more satisfying marriages, make more money, and have better health. Positive emotions prompt new cell growth, whereas negative emotions cause decay.
- High performers don't always enjoy all the hard work that goes into becoming great, but they are grateful and giddy about their craft and their opportunities overall. Show up and bring the joy.
- High performers:
  -  Prime the emotions they want to experience, in advance of key events. They think about how they want to feel, and ask themselves questions, or practice visualizations that generate those feelings.
  - Anticipate positive outcomes from their actions. They're optimistic and clearly believe that their actions will be rewarded.
  - Imagine possible stressful situations and how their best self might gracefully handle them. As much as they anticipate positive outcomes, they're realistic about hitting snags, and they prepare themselves for difficulties.
  - They seek to insert appreciation, surprise, wonder, and challenge into their day.
  - They steer social interactions toward positive emotions and experiences. They are what one respondent calls "conscious goodness spreaders."
  - They reflect regularly on all that they're grateful for.
- I ask three questions to prime my mind for a positive day:
  - What can I be excited about today? If you can't think of anything then make something up, lol.
  - What or who might trip me up or cause stress, and how can I respond in a positive way, from my highest self?
  - Who can I surprise today with a thank-you, a gift, or a moment of appreciation?
- Self-coaching: like seeing yourself stressed in a meeting but fixing it anyway.
- You can put words and phrases in your phone to remind yourself of who you want to be and how you want to interact with others. When your phone vibrates, you look at it, right? So might as well look at something that has a positive impact. "Bring the joy."
- Door frame trigger: Every time I walk through a doorway, "I will find the good in this room."
- Waiting trigger. "What level of presence do I feel right now?"
- Touch trigger. Whenever I'm introduced to someone, they get a hug.
- Gift trigger. Whenever something positive happens, I say "What a gift!"
- Stress trigger. Stress is self-created, so I decided to stop manufacturing it. What's the positive thing that I can focus on and the next right action of integrity I should take now?
- Gratitude: gratitude is the golden frame though which we see the meaning of life.
- **You can't just react well to life, you have to generate joy in it.**
- How would my best self handle this situation?
- You are on this planet for this woman. Bring joy to her life.

### Optimize Health

- When people are unhealthy, it's not because they don't know how to be healthy. We all know what to do to increase our physical energy, because by now it's common sense: exercise, food, sleep.
- "Everyone in my industry works this hard, so I have to cut out something somewhere." Then why cut health?
- Fifty years of sleep research isn't wrong re: proper duration of sleep leading to higher cognitive scores, less stress, higher life satisfaction, better health, more productivity, more profitability, and less conflict.
- So if the demands of your job or life require you to learn fast, deal with stress, be alert, pay attention, remember important things, and keep a positive mood, then you MUST take exercise more seriously.
- Beware of using meals as a way to push down negative emotions. If you feel bad, MOVE. Go for a walk and change your emotional state before eating.

## High Performance Habit #3: Raise Necessity

- Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason, mastery demands all of a person.
- "There is no point--unless you choose to make one. Either the point of your pain is to say to the world, 'This is how I've chosen to deal with this: by giving up.' Or the point is to show yourself, your fellow Marines, and the world that nothing will stop you or the spirit of service in you."
- You don't have to get better, or you choose that you must get better. It's up to you. One choice sucks and makes your life miserable forever. The other gets you out of bed.
- Performance necessity: we don't really have to do this things, we can live ordinary lives, but why do we do this?
- Necessity is the emotional drive that makes great performance a must instead of a preference. Unlike weaker desires that make you want to do something, necessity demands that you take action.
- You get things done, because you have to. There' not much choice; your heart and soul and the needs of the moment are telling you to act. It just feels right to do something. And if you didn't do it, you'd feel bad about yourself. You'd feel as though you weren't living up to your standards, meeting your obligations, or fulfilling your duties or your destiny.
- **"People need me now, they're counting on me. I can't miss this opportunity. If I don't do this now, I'll regret it forever."**
- You cannot become extraordinary without a sense that it's absolutely necessary to excel. You must get more emotionally committed to what you're doing, and reach that point where success is not an occasional preference but a soul-deep necessity.
