# Never Stop Learning: How Self-Education Creates a Bullet-Proof Career

*A career is a portfolio of projects that teach you new skills, gain you new expertise, develop new capabilities, grow your colleague set, and constantly reinvent you as a brand.*

At the heart of expanding your social graph and reinventing yourself is an unquenchable desire to learn--a mindset that stays fluid an facilitates personal growth. It is the learners, those willing to open their minds and augment their skillsets, who will be poised to succeed in the future.

After a long day at work, Netflix sounds more seductive than spending one or two hours diving into a book that challenges you to think deeply about what you do and who you are.

In today's networked age, companies and jobs rise and fall in a matter of months. That thing you do? There's now an app for that, for free. Or there will be soon. That job title of yours could change next week. When thinking about our careers, no one is safe.

*The concept of getting and holding a job in one industry for decades is outmoded, a byproduct of the industrial mindset.*

1. *Start with heroes from the past.*

Pick someone in your field and always point toward them. "That is what they do in times of self-doubt" or "that is what they do every morning to make sure they get their work done." It's not about constantly comparing to make yourself feel unworthy or unproductive, but rather using a model of aspiration, something to motivate you to find your own rhythm and exert a bit more effort.

Many of my heroes aren't alive, and if they are, I have not met them in person (yet). Their teachings are laid out in books, interviews, and articles, and their quotes are scattered throughout my notebook. Whenever I have moments of confusion or self-doubt, I re-read quotes or passages from these books to center myself.

You can actively choose your heroes, study their work and journeys, and identify the specific elements that make them great and utilize those lessons in your own life.

2. *Take advantage of free educational resources.*

"How can you squander even one more day not taking advantage of the greatest shifts of our generation? How dare you settle for less when the world has made it so easy for you to be remarkable?" - Seth Godin

Picture your great-great-grandparents learning that you have access to all this information. They would likely be stunned that you didn't spend all day reading and learning.

3. *Explore unrelated subjects.*

"Creative insights often occur by making unusual connections: seeing analogies between ideas that have not previously been related. All of our existing ideas have creative possibilities." - Sir Ken Robinson

One of my favorite joys in learning is studying seemingly unrelated subjects and then connecting them to my interests. Knowing that my mind is being exercised to connect the dots, even if it's a subject that's unfamiliar, allows me to unearth new insights and develop a richer understanding. It helps with cross-pollinating ideas, exercising creativity, and exploring the edges.

If you find yourself devouring the same kind of information constantly, change it up. Dive into subjects that youâ€™re unfamiliar with and extract insights that have potential for connection. It may not be important now, but who knows what frontiers will open up. Lifelong learners collect dots, but they are even better at connecting them.

4. *Make learning a habit.*

A desire to learn is a fruitful asset that will fuel you throughout your life. Without this unquenchable desire to grow our understanding of ourselves and the world around us, we stagnate. We become comfortable with what we know and may feel that there isn't anything else to learn. Of course, that kind of thinking is poisonous: there is always something that we can learn that will improve how we lead our lives and do our work.

In the words of the Roman Stoic philosopher, Seneca, "If wisdom were offered me on the one condition that I should keep it shut away and not divulge it to anyone, I should reject it. There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with."

Learning is the lifeblood of a fruitful career. And it's available to you right now. It's neither a personality trait nor a gift. It takes humility to admit that we have much to learn, but this realization can be a catalyst to the kind of lifelong learning that helps us improve, thrive, and contribute in a way that is deeply meaningful to ourselves and others.

## How to Take Control of Your Quest for Learning:

- Organize a group study with co-workers or friends. Carve out an hour of your day to discuss something that you learned or found interesting.
- Apply what you learn. When you read something that can improve your work, do you apply it an experiment? Learning is about improving the way you live and how you make decisions.
- Question everything.
- Share what you've learned. I write about what I've learned on my blog.
- Keep a commonplace book. From quotes, anecdotes, metaphors, studies, and links to videos, I have a database of knowledge and wisdom. Whenever I highlight something in a book or hear an amazing story, I write it down.
