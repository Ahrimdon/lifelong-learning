## How I got to 200 productive hours a month
[Reference](https://qotoqot.com/blog/improving-focus/)

- This is 6 hours a day in a month.
- Productive environment: increase the friction required to slip into distracting activities, so that it takes a significant effort to get distracted.
- What is more effective--eliminate everything distracting from your workstation and using a separate device for leisure in another room.
- Unsubscribe/mute/unfollow too-active posters, which includes all non-professional news.
- Re politics: you can't do anything meaningful about these events.
- Re phone: you shouldn't be able to mindlessly reach for it to escape your current task with a "quick check."
- Planning:
  - Split big tasks to small ones.
  - Boring simple tasks in the evening.
  - Adjust task order before going to sleep, so there's always a clear plan in the morning.
- Chats and messengers are off, doors are closed, people around you are informed that they shouldn't disturb you.

### Body

- There's not virtue in wearing out the body for the sake of some short-term deadlines.
- **Crunch is not productive--it is an emergency effort to compensate for the lack of real productivity that is achieved through good planning and sharp focus.**
- 30-60 minute naps if I feel "brain fog" in the middle of the day because sleep flushes out brain toxins and clears the mind.
- Waking up at the same time: discipline is more sustainable than the ever-changing motivation.
- Physical inactivity not only kills us, but it affects your memory and thinking too.
- The researchers found that the widening of the artery in response to blood flow reduced over three hours spent sitting without moving. However, getting up for five-minute walks in this period stopped this from happening.
- **On your desktop install an app that forces 3-5 minute breaks every hour. What's very important: make it block the screen completely and hide all the "skip" or "postpone" buttons, or you'll be ignoring these breaks.**
- Re productivity/mood: the diet is not complicated.

#### Mind

- Habit-tracking apps: they both remind you to do things and motivate you to keep daily streaks.
- No zero days.
- You can figure out if you can do tedious tasks when you know your head is empty.
- Music:
  - Fast tracks to boost focus.
  - Lower tempo or something relaxing or no music if high cognitive load.
  - Resting your mind: no phone or consuming any kind of content--just walking, exercising, or taking a nap.
- Procrastination: task is too complex or too boring, fear of failure, simple laziness.
- Meditation again.
- Working on something futile? Spending your life on fruitless nonsense.
- **Throwing away addictive sites or gaming becomes easy when you start to see them for what they are: obstructions on the way to getting something valuable done.**

## Attention, Please! What Every Man Ought to Know About Focus
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/01/20/attention-please-what-every-man-ought-to-know-about-focus/)

- Single-minded focus is just one facet of attention. Attention has different types! You must manage all your other attention mechanisms.
- Attention: taking possession of the mind of one of what seems like several simultaneous possible objects or trains of thought.
- LSD causes psychedelic experiences because it inhibits the brain's attention networks.
- What you are focusing on becomes your reality.
- Involuntary attention.
  - When we head a loud noise, etc.
  - Benefit: we get to react automatically to potentially dangerous or rewarding stimuli.
  - THIS HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY THINGS LIKE YOUTUBE.
  - A mild stimulation gives our mind soft fascination.
  - This is why spending time in nature not only feels great, but has been shown to relieve stress, anxiety, and depression.
- Voluntary attention.
  - This requires effort, willpower, and intentional concentration.
  - The more stimuli there are for involuntary attention, the harder our voluntary attention has to work to stay engaged with the task at hand.
  - Voluntary attention is what allows you to progress with your personal goals.
  - We have a finite amount of it. People complain about feeling distracted because the modern world taxes our voluntary attention so much. We need to consciously decide all the stimuli.
- Default mode: Mind wandering.
  - Mind wandering = taking your voluntary attention away from whatever you're supposed to be doing.
  - Problem: we aren't fully present, and when we let our minds wander, we drift towards negative thoughts and emotions.
  - Benefits: The brains' way of directing unused processing power towards solving unresolved problems in your life.
  - Positive-constructive daydreaming: future planning, reminiscing, moral reasoning.
  - This can also increase creativity.
  - This gives your voluntary/involuntary systems a break.
- Broad attention: surveying a field. This makes you better at understanding the big picture.
- Narrow attention: focusing on a pass. This allows us to be meticulous.

### Benefits of managing attention

- Improves relationships.
- Boosts resilience.
- Increases happiness.
- Increases creativity.
- Deepens our wisdom.
- Improves our critical thinking.
- Gives us a more flourishing and enjoyable life.

- Problem: We now live in "present shock", information is conveyed via memes and tweets, and we find it hard to separate the signal from the noise.

## Your Concentration Training Program: 11 Exercises That Will Strengthen Your Attention
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/01/30/your-concentration-training-program-11-exercises-that-will-strengthen-your-attention/)

- Managing different kinds of attention is like being the supreme commander of your mind. You must be able to deftly maneuver and deploy your units to various battles.
- The mind is a muscle. Your muscles have a limited amount of strength at any given time, and they can atrophy or strengthen from vigorous exercise.
- You get the same feeling of internal dread/doubt right before you begin an intense workout.
- **You have to tell yourself to dig deeper. You'll be surprised how much more strength and focus you actually have left in the tank.**
- Strengthening our physical and mental muscles comes down to plain, unsexy work. It's about eating right, getting ample sleep, and engaging in challenging daily exercise.

- Pomodoro.
- Distraction Facebook feed. Just put it down on a piece of paper.
- Building willpower.
- Meditation. Just 10-20 minutes of meditation.
- Practicing mindfulness throughout the day. This is about focusing completely on what you're doing, slowing down, and observing all the physical and emotional sensations you are experiencing in that moment.
- Exercise.
- Memorize stuff.
- Read long stuff slowly.
- Practice attentive listening. The ability to be fully present with a loved one or friend builds your rapport, intimacy, and trust with them.
- Concentration exercises.

[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/10/17/how-to-quit-mindlessly-surfing-the-internet-and-actually-get-stuff-done/)

- Evolution has wired our brains to be constantly scanning for changes in our environment. In modern times, this has been hijacked by the constant stream of incoming stimuli.
- Even pictures of food, money, and sex activate these reward centers.
- Steps:
  - Audit of Online Time-Wasters.
  - Just block entire sites, or block sites for certain periods of time.
- Keep the phone in a different room.

## Dig Deep: You're Stronger Than You Think
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/11/04/dig-deep-youre-stronger-than-you-think/)

- Digging deep: seeing lovely ladies? Hehe.
- Your mind can keep yourself going even when the body grows fatigued. The mind can also slow you down before you're actually physically spent. So the fatigue your brain is fighting was created by your brain.
- You can feel more tired even if the muscles exert the same effort.
- The mind thinks that you're going to use the body's limited fuel, so it puts the brakes on your exertion long before you've reached your true physical limits.
- **Simply swishing around a sugary drink/glucose in your mouth for fuel boosts athletic performance by 2%. This tricks the brain into thinking more fuel is on the way.**
- Same with willpower. Swishing = sticking to tasks longer.
- Same with emotion, same with an accident. The happiness of the victims returned to near their baseline pre-accident levels within months following the injury.
- Tapping into the hidden wells of strength:
  - Call out the bluff, just do motivation self-talk.
  - With HIIT, the treadmill makes you honest re: effort. You're forced to not slow down.
  - Competition.
  - Deadlines.

## Willpower Part I: The Force of Greatness
[Reference](Willpower Part I: The Force of Greatness)

- Willpower: came from the 19th century, with machines, people though how about the human machine and its productive energy.
- Consistently, 2 factors lead people to greater levels of happiness, health, and success: willpower and intelligence.
- People with higher levels of self-control are more emotionally stable and struggle less with anger, anxiety, depression, drug/alcohol abuse. They make more popular bosses, have more friends, and are more likely to be in a stable marriage and less likely t o get divorced.

### Understanding Willpower

- It is a mental energy that allows you to direct your actions in four categories of behavior.
  - Thoughts. They help you focus on what you want to think about.
  - Emotions. **You can't will yourself to feel happy or sad. But you can decide to take actions to change how you're feeling. "I feel sad, I'm going to go for a run, that lifts my spirits."** Faking an emotion takes willpower too.
  - Impulses. We don't have direct control over whatever pops into our head, but it does regulate how you react to the impulse.
  - Performance control. How well you can focus and concentrate on a task.
- **Whenever you have a desire to do something that conflicts with your long-term goals and your core values, willpower is the thing that kicks in and tries to keep you on track. The stronger your willpower is, the better chance of making a decision in line with your goals.**
- The unconscious is greater when it comes to our short-term decisions. So you have to control it.

## Willpower Part II: How Your Willpower Is Depleted
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/01/08/willpower-part-ii/)

- Your willpower is like a muscle in these aspects:
  - They become weak without exercise.
  - You need to stress it in the short term to improve them in the long term.
  - On any given day, you have a finite amount of strength.
  - It needs time to recover before the next workout.
- Self-control.
  - On average, people spend four hours a day resisting desires.
  - The harder a decision is, the more your willpower supply gets drained.
- Your brain on ego depletion.
  - When you're suffering from ego depletion, your brain's anterior cingulate cortex (the part of the brain that detects a mismatch between what you intended to do and what you're doing) slows down.
  - When your ego gets depleted, you actually give up on puzzles faster.
  - When you focus your willpower energy on studying, you had less of it for other things, and your hygiene/diet went in the crapper.
  - Ex: I try not to respond to pointless criticism, and I'm generally successful, except when I'm suffering ego depletion. This is why you start smoking again when you get stressed.
  - The problem with poverty: so many decisions per day, that it makes them more prone to giving into short-term impulses, even if those choices conflict with their long-term goals.
- Risk aversion: When your willpower is low, you just want the one that locks you into a set path, in order to avoid expending any more mental energy.

## Willpower Part III: How to Strengthen Your Willpower and 20 Ways to Conserve It
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/01/15/how-to-strengthen-willpower/)

- ***Work on any goal or habit that exercises your self-control.***
- When you work to change a habit, you deplete your willpower in the struggle, but over time, the strength of your willpower muscle increases from these exercises.
- Anything: using your left hand instead of your right, working on your posture, trying to stop swearing.
- ***The best part about creating a new habit is that not only does it strengthen your willpower, it also frees up more of your willpower fuel for other things.***
- This is why people with stronger self-control actually spends less time resisting desires than those with weaker self-control.

### How to Conserve Your Willpower
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/01/15/how-to-strengthen-willpower/)

- The key is to consciously conserve this force, keeping it from being frittered away on dumb stuff and saving it for the things that are most important to you.
- Only work at one goal at a time.
- Make changes during periods of calm.
- Make your goal as clear and specific as possible. People who make formal New Year's resolutions are ten times more likely to reach their goals than those with the same aims and motivation.
- Set things up on autopilot. Firewall software.
- Don't make big decisions on an empty stomach. No glucose = no willpower. ***This is why dieting is so difficult. To shed pounds you need to eat less, and to eat less you need willpower, and to get willpower you need to eat.***
- Make to-do lists.
- Figure out your next action on something. Not "plan trip", but "search for best airline fare".
- Make a pre-commitment: before going inside a restaurant, tell the others that your consumption is limited.
- Create routines.
- Build self-awareness through monitoring. Quantify your life. Food diary, weighing yourself, apps that track how long you spend online.
- Accountability something.
- Tough things first.
- Get enough sleep/take naps.
- Limit your choices. This is why speed daters have better luck finding a partner than those who use online dating sites.
- Keep yourself and your surroundings clean.
- Surround yourself with those who have similar goals.
- Out of sight, out of mind.
- Delay gratification.
- Higher purpose. Strong correlation between having self-control and being religious.

## The science of willpower
[Reference](http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2011/12/29/a-conversation-about-the-science-of-willpower/)

- Willpower is a complex mind-body response that can be compromised with stress, sleep deprivation and nutrition and can be strengthened with certain practices.
- Stress response to willpower is a reaction to an internal conflict. You want to do one thing, but know you shouldn't. Or you know you should do something, but you'd rather do nothing.
- When we're at chronic stress, it's harder to find willpower. The fight-or-flight response floods the body with energy to act instinctively and steals it from the areas of the brain needed for wise decision-making.
  - Sleep deprivation = bad. It's almost like you're drunk.
  - Nutrition = influences how available energy is for the brain. Even eating a more plant-based, less-processed diet makes energy more available to the brain.
- Willpower: people run out of it. Any act of self-control leaves people with less willpower for completely unrelated challenges.
  - Using your self-control muscle may be tiring, but over time, the workout increases your strength and stamina. What starts out difficult becomes easier over time.
  - New behaviors become habits, temptations become less overwhelming and willpower challenges can even become fun.
- Increasing willpower: meditation and physical exercise. Brain changes have been observed after 8 weeks of brief daily meditation training.
- Think big: when you scale up for what you want, you have more willpower.
- Think small: giving yourself permission to take microsteps toward your goal.
