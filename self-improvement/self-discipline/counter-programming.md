- Years of heavy Internet use have literally reprogrammed your brain.
- Your smartphone, laptop, social media accounts are all working together to hijack your brain's natural reward system.
- If it's programming, you can counter-program yourself.
- Dopamine: social interaction, sex, justice, novelty, humor, information intake, winning arguments.
- Programming cultivates:
  - Mindlessness. A need to avoid the present moment and escape into the on-screen world, which is associated with safety and comfort.
  - Scattered thinking. An inability to set priorities and focus on what's important.
  - Ego and insecurity. Validation comes from externalities, so it's impossible to develop real self-esteem.
  - Diminished motivation. Easy rewards, so why pursue difficult, messy real-world achievements?
  - Increased anxiety. Your stress system gets compromised by "the world is ending" news.
  - Meanness and cynicism.

### Counter-programming: 9 major principles

- ***Be purposeful about digital.***
  - The programming: turn to a screen whenever you need something.
  - The counter-programming: Be intentional when using your digital devices. "Why am I using this? What am I hoping to accomplish here?" Cut back on aimless browsing. Don't treat digital like a heap way to fill dead air with mindless clicking. Make it harder to whip out your phone.
- ***Displace digital from its central role in your life.***
  - The programming: look at your phone, the TV, the computer.
  - The counter-programming: Instead of treating life as an undifferentiated blur, strive to make a clean break between your (purposeful) digital time and your everything-else, real-life time. Try to look sparingly.
- ***Cut out junk-food content.***
  - The programming: Digital "junk food". Twitter, Buzzfeed, endlessly novel, highly stimulating, gleefully immature, accessible anywhere.
      - Marcus Aurelius: "Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts." Do you really want your thoughts to be like Twitter or Buzzfeed, endlessly sarcastic/relentlessly bitchy?
  - The counter-programming: You are what you eat. Tier your information into "Never", "Sometimes", and "Always".
    - Other Never sites: virtually all of news, blogs that are cruel/snarky/gossipy, political stuff.
    - Sometimes: Sensible indulgences. Reddit (good subreddits), Facebook, the New York Times. Intelligently written blogs. Entrepreneurs, motivational and health content.
    - Always: Books. Writing a book is hard, and the standards are comparatively high, so ideas tend to be better thought out and researched.
    - Philosophy, self-development, history/business/biographies, cool fiction. You'll find that there are people and blogs that are consistently good. Get on their mailing list and read their stuff when it comes out.
    - ***Remember: triviality is suffocating. Does it matter who did what at the Emmy's, does it matter that Twitter had THIS to say? Does it matter than some jackass went online and said something stupid? If you want to think big, apply your mind to big things, over which you have some level of influence. Don't scatter your thoughts among a million insubstantial flecks.***
- ***Stop multi-tasking.***
  - The programming: flicking from one screen to the next.
  - The counter-programming: Reacquaint yourself with the joys of deep focus on your work, and presence with your current state of mind.
  - Disable notifications, Pomodoro technique, close unneeded tabs, put on chill, non-distracting music, use a Focus/break technique like Pomodoro intervals.
- ***Replace social media with real social interactions.***
  - The programming: A live, always-on feed of social information from friends, family, colleagues, former dorm-mates. Show off your cool life and celebrate the coolness of others.
    - The human mind is hard-wired to be social, and social media offers a simulacra that will endlessly entice, but never satisfy.
  - The counter-programming: Engage in frequent, extended social bonding with flesh-and-blood human beings. Call up old friends/acquaintances and actually go to coffee to catch up. Ask strangers out. Go out to visit a friend, and just be with them.
- ***No porn.***
  - The programming: Indulge your hedonistic desires to your heart's content. It's normal, healthy, and free. This is actually really bad.
  - The counter-programming: Stop watching. There is no reason that a healthy and well-adjusted person should need to watch porn. None.
- ***Screen-free mornings and evenings.***
  - The counter-programming: Morning/evening routine that omits screen time.
- ***Align values with behavior online.***
  - The programming: Let your inner child loose online. When you complain online, your real-life experience sours.
  - The counter-programming: You aspire to be a kind, generous, emotionally stable, pragmatic, thoughtful, intelligent, purposeful, and motivated person. So act like it. Don't fill the web with cruelty, snide judgments, self-deprecation, and immaturity.
  - Don't ever complain online. It's pointless and narcissistic. Nobody cares about your complaints nearly as much as you do.
- ***Cultivate real excellence.***
  - The programming: Get the highest score, likes.
  - The counter-programming: Life is short. We all die. In order to meet the decline without regret, we must work on ourselves. We should aspire towards excellence. Not impossible excellence, but real excellence. An enjoyable, productive life filled with good experiences and good people, free of unnecessary suffering, beholden to no one.
  - Do. Do the thing. The decline is coming. Fill it with happy memories. The rest will take care of itself.
