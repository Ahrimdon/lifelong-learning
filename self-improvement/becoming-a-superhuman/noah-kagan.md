- A/B test how you're learning or who you're learning from.
- I just go for things. I don't hesitate, I just do it.
- I did projects in the morning, at night, and at the weekends. A lot of people want that, but are they really putting in the time for that?
- Allocate time for thinking your problems.
- Your phone is your employee, not your CEO.
- *Reflect, after the time you've spent today on your phone, what have I gotten out of this?*
- If something goes bad, just ask yourself, "how can I make it better next time?"
- Hesitation is the enemy of getting it done.
- Getting up at 5am--this is just where he is most productive. So find the time where you are most productive and do your shit at that time.
