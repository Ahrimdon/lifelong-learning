## "I Don't Know"

- **The point of confidence isn't to bullshit your way through a presentation.** And I won't teach you how to sell crappy work. My target audience is people who do amazing work, but were never taught how to sell it correctly. Thankfully our industry is full them.
- People feel confident about work they're receiving when the person delivering is doing it confidently. IT makes them feel smart.
- Confidence saves time. If you're not sure what you're showing me, why should I be sure about it?
- When someone asks you something that stumps you, you can say: "I don't know, but I'm excited to find out!" "'I don't' know has become 'I don't know yet'". - Bill Gates
- Letting people that you're confident enough to admit that you're at a loss is when you beat the level boss. No one has all the answers, and pretending you do doesn't make you look confident, it makes you look like a fool.
