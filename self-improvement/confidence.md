- **The point of confidence isn't to bullshit your way through a presentation.** And I won't teach you how to sell crappy work. My target audience is people who do amazing work, but were never taught how to sell it correctly. Thankfully our industry is full them.
- People feel confident about work they're receiving when the person delivering is doing it confidently. IT makes them feel smart.
- Confidence saves time. If you're not sure what you're showing me, why should I be sure about it?
- When someone asks you something that stumps you, you can say: "I don't know, but I'm excited to find out!" "'I don't' know has become 'I don't know yet'". - Bill Gates
- Letting people that you're confident enough to admit that you're at a loss is when you beat the level boss. No one has all the answers, and pretending you do doesn't make you look confident, it makes you look like a fool.

# The Secret of Self-Esteem
[Reference](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201411/the-secret-self-esteem)

- Just as the foundation of successful experience is self-confidence, so the foundation of self-confidence is successful experience
- In the absence of confidence, courage takes over. Confidence operates in the realm of the known, courage in the realm of the unknown, the uncertain, and the fearsome. I could not have become a confident swimmer unless I once had the courage to lose my footing in deep water. Courage is more noble than confidence, because it requires greater effort and greater strength, and because a courageous person is one with limitless capabilities and possibilities.
- Self-confidence and self-esteem often go hand in hand, but, for all that, are not one and the same thing. In particular, it is possible to be highly self-confident and yet to have profoundly low self-esteem, as is the case, for example, with many performers and celebrities, who are able to play to cameras and large audiences and yet struggle behind the scenes.
- Healthy self-esteem - do not need to prop themselves up with externals such as income, status, or notoriety, or use alcohol, drugs, or sex.
- Self-confidence: "I can." Self-esteem: "I am." Pride: "I did." To feel proud is to take pleasure and satisfaction from the goodness of our past actions and achievements.
- Arrogance = "to claim for oneself or assume." Arrogant people demand constant reaffirming and reassuring, which accounts for their boastfulness, entitlement, and anger. People with healthy self-esteem do not seek to prop themselves up by pushing others down, but a re happy to revel in the miracle of existence, with cheerfulness, humility, and quiet action.
- There can be no thing as excessive self-esteem. Humility does not correlate with self-esteem. Humble people understand that there is more to life than themselves, which is a mark of the healthiest self-esteem.
- Low-self esteem = from traumatic childhood experiences such as prolonged separation from parent figures. Low self-esteem = mental disorder, chicken-and-egg.
- Buddhist notion of diligence - to delight in positive deeds, and the person who does not engage in positive deeds is guilty of "laziness" or "spiritual sloth".
  - Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them.
  - Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it.
  - Let me not crave in anxious fear to be saved but hope for the patience to win my freedom.
  - Grant me that I may not be a coward, feeling your mercy in my success alone;
  - But let me find the grasp of your hand in my failure.
- A long list of talents and achievements is no substitute for a healthy self-esteem.
-  Whenever we stand up for our values and face the consequences, we can feel ourselves growing. This is what growth depends on. Growth depends on bravely living up to our ideals, not the ideals of the company, our parents', our children's successes, or anything else that is not truly our own, but instead, a betrayal of ourselves.
- *Socrates is a shining example of someone who bravely lived up to his ideals, and, in the end, bravely died for them. He never lost faith in the mindâ€™s ability to discern and decide, and to apprehend and master reality. Nor did he ever compromise truth and integrity for a pitiable life of self-deception and semi-consciousness. In seeking relentlessly to align mind with matter and thought with fact, he remained faithful both to himself and to the world, with the result that he is still alive today in this sentence and millions of others about him.*
