## [How did Steve Jobs delegate product management?](http://www.quora.com/Steve-Jobs/How-did-Steve-Jobs-delegate-product-management)

#### Laxmikanth Dorai, Here to put a dent in the Universe!

Following his intuition. Breaking conventions. Breaking hierarchies and letting the best ideas to win. 

Hiring great people who wanted to create insanely great products. Forming great teams. Keeping the process simple. Being super honest. 

Values and making great products for people mattered to him more than anything else. That was the focus. Everything else was secondary. 


1996: "Well, I don't know what corporate lifestyle is, I mean Apple was a corporation, we were very conscious of that, we were very driven to make money so that we can continue to invest in the things that we loved but it had a very few big differences to other corporate lifestyles that I had seen. The first one was, a real belief that an hierarchy of ideas that mapped into the hierarchy of the organization, in other words, great ideas can come from anywhere and that we better sort of treat people in a much more egalitarian sense, in terms of where ideas came from. And Apple was a very bottom-up company when it came to lot of great ideas and we hired, you know truly great people and gave them the room to do great work. And lot of companies, I know it sounds crazy, but lot of companies don't do that. They hire people to tell them what to do, we hire people to tell us what to do. And that lead to a very different corporate culture. And one that's much more collegial than hierarchal"

2004: "The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process. Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. But that's not what it's about. Process makes you more efficient. But innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we've been thinking about a problem. It's ad hoc meetings of six people called by someone who thinks he has figured out the coolest new thing ever and who wants to know what other people think of his idea. And it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important."

1985: "We were in stage where we went out and thought, Oh! We gonna be a big company, so let's hire professional management. We went and hired a bunch of professional management but it didn't work out all well. Most of them were bozos, they knew how to manage but they didn't how to do anything! So, if you are a great person, why would you want to work with someone you can't learn anything from? You know what's interesting? You know who the best managers are? They are the great individual contributors who never ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be manager because no one else is gonna do a job as good as them"

Status Quo Versus Change: 

"The best way I came up with to effect changes at Apple is by example and that was probably anything else the reason I spent two and half years on Macintosh, was to try by example "Hey! here is a better way to do things! And it turns out, it worked! Everyone at Apple now have looked at the Macintosh experience and come in and said, we could take lot of these concepts and apply them better in some ways and model every other factory after Macintosh factory, every other product team doing it's product have been modelled after the Macintosh team" 

Managing great people:

"We wanted people who were insanely great at what they did, but not necessarily the seasoned professionals but who had on tips of their fingers and in their passion, the latest understanding where technology was and what we could do with technology and who wanted to bring that to lots of people, so, the neatest thing that happened was when you get a core group of ten great people, it becomes self policing has who they let into the group. So I consider the most important job of someone like myself is recruiting. The greatest people are self managing. They don't need to be managed. Once they know what to do, they will go figure out how to do it. They don't need to be managed at all. What they need is a common vision. And that's what leadership is. What leadership means is having a vision and being able to articulate that , so the people around you can understand it and getting a consencus on a common vision"  

2003: “My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other’s kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. That’s how I see business: great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people.” 

Insights from great people: 

When late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs assembled his first iPhone development team, he wasn't focused on conceiving a device that would run all sorts of apps and media but instead laid out a simple mission to his team: to create the first phone people would love so much, they'd never leave the house without it.

This insight into the thought process during the early days of the iPhone's development was shared during a lecture at a California school by former iPhone product marketing engineer Bob Borchers, who may be best known for his appearances in some of the iLife and iPhone guided tour videos. 

"What's interesting is that the challenge Steve laid out for us when we created the iPhone wasn't to make a touch-screen device that would play apps and do all of this stuff," Borchers told students. "His [charge] was simple. He wanted to create the first phone that people would fall in love with. That's what he told us."

"Now if you're an engineer, like I am by training, you're like 'what the heck does that mean?'," he said. "But he was right. The idea was, he wanted to create something that was so instrumental and integrated in peoples' lives that you'd rather leave your wallet at home than your iPhone."

Borchers noted that Apple's success largely stemmed from focusing on only a handful of fundamental concepts: break the rules but do so in an exceptionally well manner, pay attention to detail and make people "think differently" about the relationship they have with their device, especially given that smartphones already existed in the market.

The product had to be a revolutionary mobile phone, the best iPod to date, and also let users carry "the internet in their pocket," the latter of which was somewhat of a foreign concept at the time, Borchers said. Downloadable apps, advanced GPS capabilities, video and photography features, and voice integration weren't part of the original mandate. 

Instead, those featured blossomed from Apple's successful formation of a platform that could continue to surprise and delight users over time, with Jobs in particular exercising his penchant for perfection and attention to detail every step of the way.

For instance, Borchers recounted how the original iPhone almost shipped with a plastic touchscreen but right before its debut, Jobs confronted his team with the concern that while the plastic would protect the underlying LCD, it would scratch when users kept it in their pocket with keys and other items. This prompted his team to improvise on the spot, convincing Corning to resume production of its then-abandoned Gorilla Glass, which turned out to be the superior solution.
Similarly, Borchers also detailed Apple's well-known obsession with product packaging, saying that Apple spends "way too much time on" product presentation but its ultimately worth it because it effectively communicates to consumers that the product inside the box is special.

Meanwhile, Jobs and his team also did their part to break the rules of engagement when it came to dealing with its first official wireless carrier AT&T. As was customary at the time, the carrier wanted to purchase all of the phones outright from Apple and then turn around and market them to customers on its own.

"We said no, we don't want to do that,'" Borchers said. "We want to be able to sell the iPhone. We want to be able to talk directly to the customer. That was a big, big change for the industry.” 

Sachin Agarwal learned a lot about Apple's management style during his days as an engineer. He worked at the company for 6 years, before leaving to start the simple blogging platform Posterous.

"I loved working there... [Choosing to leave] was a really hard decision," he says.

But, when he left, he made sure to take a few important management lessons with him, which have helped make Posterous successful as well.

- A tech company should be run by engineers, not managers
- Building a culture of respect between managers and employees
- Give employees the freedom to own and improve the product
- Challenge your employees to grow
- Deadlines are crucial
- Don't play the "feature game" with your competition.
- Hire people who are insanely passionate about your product
- You should maintain that startup culture even when you are a big company

"My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. Everything else was secondary. 

I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company. John Akers at IBM was a smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn’t know anything about product. The same thing happened at Xerox. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It happened at Apple when Sculley came in, which was my fault, and it happened when Ballmer took over at Microsoft. Apple was lucky and it rebounded, but I don’t think anything will change at Microsoft as long as Ballmer is running it.

I hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business. That’s how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will still stand for something a generation or two from now. That’s what Walt Disney did, and Hewlett and Packard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That’s what I want Apple to be I don’t think I run roughshod over people, but if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It’s my job to be honest. I know what I’m talking about, and I usually turn out to be right. That’s the culture I tried to create. We are brutally honest with each other, and anyone can tell me they think I am full of shit and I can tell them the same. And we’ve had some rip-roaring arguments, where we are yelling at each other, and it’s some of the best times I’ve ever had. I feel totally comfortable saying “Ron, that store looks like shit” in front of everyone else. Or I might say “God, we really fucked up the engineering on this” in front of the person that’s responsible. That’s the ante for being in the room: You’ve got to be able to be super honest. Maybe there’s a better way, a gentlemen’s club where we all wear ties and speak in this Brahmin language and velvet code-words, but I don’t know that way, because I am middle class from California. I was hard on people sometimes, probably harder than I needed to be. I remember the time when Reed was six years old, coming home, and I had just fired somebody that day, and I imagined what it was like for that person to tell his family and his young son that he had lost his job. It was hard. But somebody’s got to do it. I figured that it was always my job to make sure that the team was excellent, and if I didn’t do it, nobody was going to do it. You always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn’t.  The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That’s what I’ve always tried to do—keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying."

The companies with the brightest future seem to have one "editor".   They avoid designing products by committee.   Compare the iPhone to the Android phones and you will understand what I mean.  The android phone can ostensibly do more than the iPhone, but nothing is done brilliantly.  In contrast, the iphone, does less things exceedingly well.
