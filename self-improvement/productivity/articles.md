# Productivity
[Reference](http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)

- Pick the right thing to work on.
- Strong beliefs about the world.
- Leaving enough time in the schedule to think about what I'm working on: reading books, hanging out with interesting people, spending time in nature.
- I can't be productive working on things I don't care about or don't like. I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do them.
- Figure out what the delegated person likes to do, and that's what you delegate to them.
- There are things that you would really work on for free.
- Smart work: You want to be around smart, productive, happy, and positive people that don't belittle your ambitions. I love being around people who push me and inspire me to be better. To the degree you are able to, avoid the opposite kind of people.
- You have to both pick the right problem and do the work. There aren't many shortcuts. To do something very important, you are very likely going to work both smart and hard.
- Prioritization: lists.
  - The more I get done, the more I get things started.
  - I find that if I really want something to happen and I pus hard enough, it usually happens. So I try to be ruthless about saying no to stuff and doing non-critical things in the quickest way possible.
- Keep enough space to allow for chance encounters and exposure to new people and ideas.
- Meetings are usually in the afternoon.
- Physical factors: Sleep + exercise + nutrition.
- No to eating lots of sugar. Try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion/spike inflammation (ex: spicy foods). Supplement vegetarian diet thingies.
- Workspace: natural light, quiet, knowing I won't be interrupted, long blocks of time, desk + couch, custom software for the things I do frequently.
- Don't neglect your friends and family for the sake of productivity, that's a very stupid trade-off.
