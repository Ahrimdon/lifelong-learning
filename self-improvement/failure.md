## [`/bauski/`](http://www.reddit.com/user/bauski):

The computer was a tool used to perpetuate my real struggle. My problem was that I knew I had potential and talent. When I did things I liked, or when I was motivated enough, people loved what I did. They said I had a new way of looking at things.

The idea that I was special, and that I was cognizantly faster, made my struggle harder and harder.

The struggle was that I could imagine the perfect life, the perfect things, the perfect project, but all the work looked so difficult. While in my mind I could think of the most perfect things, the most perfect ways, and the most perfect scenes, in real life, I couldn't be bothered to do then, because I was afraid to start.

The best part is that as you get older, your brain chemical balance will settle down and you will feel better, and things won't feel as bad, but you must start now, and you must take steps to work out of it, if you are going to move on with your life.

## Mindset:

1. Failure is a specific label for a specific type of result.
2. Failure will not kill you.
3. You learn more from failure than you will from success.
4. Failure can lead to success.
5. Results are rarely as important as the journey.

Remember that *failure is just a temporary state that results from such actions.* It is a label we put on to results, just the same as we put on a label for "success".

If you go for a run, what are the state of possible results? You either run, or you don't. What if you end up walking in between? What if you only do 1 lap? What if you walk 5? What is failure? What is failure based upon? If you jogged, walked, or ran, and you enjoyed the moment, and you got some exercise, isn't that good enough?

Judging yourself upon results is useless and will only amount to sadness. Don't worry about failure. Don't worry about the fact that most of your projects you start will not end up in the same way you planned it to be. The fact of trying is what is important. The fact of opening up that blank screen and writing those first 6 words is important. Not what those words say. That can come later.

## Part 2

1. People are so worried about themselves they don't have time to worry about you.
2. The very high majority of people want to look smart and strong.
3. The very high majority of people really just want somebody they can share their hopes and problems with.
4. The more open you are to people, the more open people will be to you.
5. When people say something awful, it is rarely intentional, and often caused by something unrelated to you.
6. There is an unstopping wealth of love, ideas, beliefs, and resources within people.
7. There is no "normal" when it comes to humans.

To cure anxiety, deal with the mindset and the belief that is causing your anxiety. There are no perfect scenarios of meeting people, no perfect get-togethers.

The truth really will set you free. Instead of "everything is okay", tell other people how things really are. Tell them a little bit of what you want to share (it takes time).

By opening yourself up to others (for me it was my parents), you get to not worry about your problems anymore, since someone else knows about them. You won't get to deal with your issues by yourself. Telling strangers can be nice, but I suggest really sharing your problems to people that care about you.

Start with your parents, then do friends, or vice versa, people you trust in this world. You gotta go out and open yourself up, because people want that.

1. Baby steps.
2. Two steps forward is easy, one step back is hard.
3. Loving yourself is the hardest thing to do.
4. Live in the now.

Just a little bit of progress can go a long way. Instead of trying to do 3 courses like a "normal" person, try doing 1 class that you know you'll enjoy. Take walks, try to figure out what your heart really wants to do, not just things that make you upset about yourself. Think of how you feel and stop yourself from doing the things that make you unhappy.

When that progress stops, it hurts. Progress cannot continue on a straight path forever. Remember that pitfalls are just a part of life. There is no failure. As long as you get back up, because you'll get sick of being stuck, you'll start moving forward again, and you'll start remembering all the lessons that you've taught all over again, and then you'll progress once more. But it'll get easier, and you'll feel a little bit better. Cause that's how life goes.

Final advice: Breathe. Every time you do anything, take a long breath and live in the now. Try to enjoy the moment of whatever you are doing. Try to enjoy the small and fine details of the process, instead of worrying about results and pride. People don't give a shit. Just make sure to take care of yourself. Breath, enjoy, love, and remember to have fun.

On opening up:

1. I like taking walks. Nice and slow, I usually like taking my time to enjoy the scenery and calming myself down, but it's all really for the purpose of opening myself up to myself. To give myself enough time to respond and really dig into my emotions. I find walking works better for me than just trying to sit and think, because it gives me a feeling of progression that keeps my mind going.
2. I write myself a journal entry. I don't usually keep a journal, but from time toe time, I feel the need to get my thoughts out concretely. The visual feedback of seeing my thoughts on paper gives me a feeling of progression, but also clarifies the fuzzy thoughts I might have so that I can clearly understand them.
3. I also drive around, listening to music, and letting it all wash away, that's always been a nice way to open up to myself.

The methods are the same. The first ingredient is time. Start with subtle and general things like "How are you doing? How was your day? What's up? Is everything well? What has you down? What are you excited about? That slowly leads into the secret things you'll want to know.

The second ingredient is honesty. You can't force honest on yourself, but you can practice it like a muscle. If you have strong emotions about something that has happened, try to ask "Why" are you feeling that, and "is that really the honest feeling"? You'd be surprised by how often I've had a strong emotion that was distressing come out to be just a reaction to a different emotion that was behind it. The instantaneous filters we have on our lives is quite remarkable.

Finally, the idea of opening up. I've personally found it quite helpful in my life. Not just for opening up to people, so that I can say clearly what I mean, but for putting clarity into my life goals, daily plans, and even my smallest actions. Having clear intentions to myself has let me proceed with my actions without having to second guess all the reasons or choices. Not only that it has let me deal with life.

I think we all find ways to deal with life, either with nice escapes, and/or pleasant confrontations. Video games has always been a nice escape for me. I used to smoke a lot of weed, and that wasn't such a nice escape, but for some of my friends, they can be productive and still use it to relax. Others have TV shows, books, alcohol. On the other side, having a way to confront your life, and take account of it is also an important part. People write journals, or diaries, or see therapists, meditate, have council with friends all for that reason.

But nothing, to my knowledge has ever been quite the same as just taking some time to enjoy my own company and open up to myself. Of course I still talk to friends, and of course I still have escapes that I use, but each has a very special place in my heart. So I don't know if it's the right thing for you, but I highly recommend trying it out and seeing if it works for you.

On compassion:

Compassion is another word for sympathy and empathy. Don't worry about having to open up to compassion. Trying to strive for a concept is ultimately vague and hard.

The real goal should be opening up to that one person.

Are there people that love you in your life? If there are, then starting with them is best. The only thing you have to do is to open yourself up. Not just talking with them, but really sharing things that you think are important. Things that you hope that you can't tell anyone, or things that you love, things that hurt you, and trying to ask pertinent questions to get them to do the same.

This exercise of sharing will gradually help you practice the skill needed to open up to other people in your life. The more you share the less indifference you'll start to feel.

Sharing with others is going to be incredibly hard because you won't know what things you are saying are actually certain.

Think of it this way: conversing with yourself helps you solidify your own beliefs and life plans and dreams, talking to others helps you mold these closer to reality. But without either, there is no way to walk with certainty in life.

On social anxiety:

Social anxiety, for me at least, and for my friends, had a big part to do with the fear of looking stupid in front of other people. A suave friend of mine had a constant fear that if he ever shared his interests/about himself, people would laugh at him and judge him behind his back.

The reality is, we all get judged for everything we do. We can't look good to everyone. We can come off as too creepy when we are trying to be nice. We can come off as cold when we try to be cool. We will come off like an annoying know-it-all when we're trying to share, or an egoist when we want to celebrate our results. That is reality.

None of that really matters, because in the end, I know I will have friends and family that care about me, and everyday I will try to open up to them more, and they will understand what my true intentions are. *And something that means so more than that is the fact that I will always know what I meant, and I will always love myself, and for that , there is nothing those other people can ever give me.*

Those judgements are minuscule and temporary. They will only be relevant in that moment for them, and in the next scene they will have completely forgotten about it, because they, just like everyone else, is so focused on their lives, their judgments about you won't matter at all.

The more you are able to be compassionate towards other people, the more you are willing to let your guard down, the more willing to be less judgmental towards them, the less you stop worrying about them being judgmental towards you.

I've found that opening up to others can be a beautiful experience, and something that gives me sanity all the time. Talking to my friends is one of the most wonderful comforts I have.

One of my friend asks me randomly but seriously, "what is your happiest and most memorable moments ?". At first I stupidly answered, "when I finished a really hard game and felt satisfied". My friend looked worried and said "seriously, you can do better than that". Thats when I started thinking hard about what actually made me happy in all those years. Finally I gave up and breakdown crying because I realized that I had no such moments, all my life I've been a living hollow.

After a lot of introspections, I realized that, its not that I didn't experience happy moments, its just that I didn't recognize past moments as such. To put it simply I am poor at being grateful for what I have. This really hits home for me, I cant recommend it enough for those of you who have trouble expressing your thoughts. I never thought being vulnerable would be so liberating and invigorating.

When my kid started to be able to talk, we started a ritual a dinner time, where we do our "best and worst" of the day. The thing is, at first my husband and I really struggled to come up with any Bests, though of course the Worsts are easy. It's made us really examine every day to come up with what was the best thing that happened. Every day we take a second to just think about that and to be grateful, even if it's something really small.

Often, our bests are something like "Seeing you." or "Coming home," which is really sweet to hear. It's taught me to pay attention just a little more.

I love everything that you all have said. OP, I hope everything works out for you man. Here are a few things that have made me an overall happier person.

- Hug. And hug often. Something about hugging another person always makes me feel more connected, safe, and it feels good for the soul.
- Spend at least ten minutes a day in thought or meditation.
- Laugh often. Find things that you find funny and surround yourself with them as often as possible.
- Have your emotions move you to tears. Not necessarily sad or happy tears, but just having your emotions bring you to tears can cleanse your soul so to speak.
- Don't turn down opportunities that are presented to you, even if they aren't always comfortable. They might not always end the way you want them to, but you had an experience you otherwise wouldn't have.

I know these are very generic rules to live by, but since I've started making an effort to apply these to my everyday life, it's made me a happier person.

 Also, a few months ago I started drinking at least a gallon of water a day. I don't drink cokes or anything else, just a few cups of coffee and some booze on the weekends. I can't tell you how much better I feel and how much more energy I have naturally just from drinking a gallon of water a day. Plus I lost 20 lbs in two months without changing my diet at all. Pretty sweet unexpected perk!

He is basically saying it is okay to fail, and it is. You can be afraid that you will say something stupid and that maybe someone will judge you for it, but you must tell yourself that this is okay. It is okay for another human being to judge you in a way you might not find comfortable. You must be okay with the fact that not everyone will like you, and that some people will find you weird and socially awkward. This is okay. When you truly let yourself go from your ego and just live in the now, you will feel at peace. Not everyone will hold a good image of you. Not everyone will like you. Not everyone will think you are a good person to spend time with. These things are all okay. Once you let go of your ego, you will feel better.

"You're left with nothing because you let all the things that mattered drop to the wayside."

This is exactly what happens. You see people rationalize it, or make a faux zen observation that "it" was never really meant to be, but the truth is that the only things that stick around in the life of people like that are the things where all the effort comes from someone else, where they're forced to deal with it every day, and it is impractical or socially frowned upon for them to run.

These folks never actually get what they need out of life, they end up fighting the needs they feel growing inside when they sense something or someone starting to matter. The need does not go away, they just waste energy fighting it or pretending like they can do without it, like the need does not exist. They just don't want to give, to work for it, and they're ultimately terrified to lose.

I don't think that they realize that for everything they've lost and let go, the things they actually needed, the things they wanted from a place deep within themselves, when they let those things go, they're letting to of bits of their own soul, of their identity and essential being.

I love your advice about the six words, because that is about opening the door to trying. Every small step that moves towards trying to fulfill the dreams you have within, the goals/people that have mattered in your heart but failed to matter in your actions, is a step is worth taking. The slightest step is better than no step. While accepting yourself is important, and trying not to be too hard on yourself is important, they come with responsibility of honest self-reflection, self-evaluation, and being honest with yourself about what your true needs and wants are.

Too often the idea of acceptance is used as a free pass to deny/ignore/skip the work required to make something happen. *Real acceptance is being honest about what's inside you, how you really feel, what you really need from life and the people around you, and realizing that you've been doing without, acknowledging what you've been trying to pretend is true or not true.* You take those truths, and merge it with the good/beneficial things about your life in the present. Add this truth in with the small steps of trying each day, and you are on a journey in which you will have more peace and satisfaction than you have ever known.
