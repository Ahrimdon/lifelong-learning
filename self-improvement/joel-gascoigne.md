## Expert of nothing
[Link](http://joel.is/post/42713179646/expert-of-nothing)

One of the most interesting and simultaneously challenging realizations I’ve had is that as a founder, especially the CEO, you essentially have chosen to never become an expert of anything. 

If I look back at the whole of the last year, I wasn’t coding, I was doing a bunch of other things. Important things.

For much of the first year, I was coding. I did whatever was needed to build the product, from design and front-end work to back-end and server admin.

We got into AngelPad and Tom immediately joined us. That was when I first fired myself. I was no longer the main coder, Tom took over and gradually all of my code was touched and improved in some way by Tom.

A few months later, we realized the power of mobile for Buffer. I jumped in and learned to code Android, just enough to build a decent version of Buffer for Android. It was hard, I was stuck almost every day with a new challenge in Java.

It’s pretty hard at times, if I’m totally frank. There are days when I wonder what it is I even do anymore. Everything used to be so tangible - I would write a line of code, and it would do something for me. These days, there are these fluffy things like culture (and it’s so important), and I have to direct product and hire new people. I have to manage much of the team, and talk with investors. I truly have no idea what I’m doing - I have zero previous experience of hiring, or managing people, or being a product manager.

## Work harder on yourself than you do on your job

> “Work harder on yourself than you do on your job.” – Jim Rohn

*It usually takes a few tries.* Looking back and joining the dots of my own journey it is interesting to recall the number of different projects and startups I’ve started before hitting something that has worked. For that reason, I think it’s not a smart approach to put all your eggs in the “current startup” basket. Instead, it’s good to work on yourself.

*Be open, vocal, and build your network.* Looking back, one of the things that has helped me the most when starting Buffer was the fact that during the year and a half I was working on my previous startup, I was consistently sharing my progress via Twitter, Facebook and blogging. As a result of being open and quite vocal about startups and my learnings, I had reached a total of 1700 followers on Twitter, and a few on other platforms too. Since the initial target user of Buffer was a Twitter user, this was a great channel for me.

More followers = more credibility, I think?

*Do activities to improve all aspects of yourself.* Marketing and blogging: Pay attention to marketer on your team, personal blog brought him a lot fo benefits. Coder: Open source. Exercise. Speaking/mentoring: offering advice on validation idea, gaining traction, fundraising, etc.

## The Habits of Successful People: Thinking in Ratios
[Link](http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-habits-of-successful-people-thinking-in-ratios)

Something I’ve found difficult to completely embrace, but which understanding has been super important, is the idea that there is a ratio for everything.

*Law of averages.* I think we all understand that we might not get a 100% success rate on everything we do. In fact, in most cases it is far lower. Knowing that success happens in ratios allowed me to go ahead and send that email, without worrying about not getting a response, about ‘failing’.

*Ratio thinking in marketing.* I can remember very well many of the conversations I had with Leo. What he did so well was to quickly realize the law of averages and know that to get a single reply, a large number of emails must be sent to bloggers for a potential guest post. 

Once you’ve established the success rate, for example 20%, you can keep working and eventually the ratio will improve. Maybe you’ll eventually get 3/10 instead of 2. Once that happened, Leo was smart and moved on to bigger blogs and pulled that ratio back down to 20%. This technique led us to our first 100,000 users.

*Ratio thinking in fundraising.* Get in contact with 200 investors, meetings with 50, in the end we closed a $450K seed from 18 investors.

## 6 Simple Things You Can Do Every Day To Be Consistently Happy
[Link](http://blog.bufferapp.com/6-simple-things-i-do-every-day-to-be-consistently-happy)

*Wake up early.* Through experimentation, I’ve found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, I’ve found I crave that “early morning” feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused.

Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.

*Exercise daily.* I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. I’ve also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.

*Have a habit of disengagement.* As I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which I’ve done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else. This prompts reflection and relaxation.

*Regularly help others.* For some time I had been consistently meeting founders to help them with their startups without realising that it was making me so happy. Then when I read Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life’s Most Important Skill by Matthieu Ricard I connected the dots of when I was happy and the activity I was doing: helping others.

In fact, Adam Grant highlights in his latest book, that spending just 100 hours a year on helping others can significantly increase our happiness.

*Learn new skills – the power of novelty and our brains.* The “flow” state has been found to trigger happiness. In addition, when learning something new you are able to learn a lot in a short space of time due to a steep learning curve. For example, in the last two weeks I’ve started learning Android development from scratch and I’ve personally found incredible the amount I know now compared to nothing two weeks ago.

*Have multiple ways to “win” each day.* Since the above activities are habitual, many days of the week I actually accomplish all of them. If I succeed with all five, I have a truly amazing day and feel fantastic. I have goals for Buffer, and I have goals in my weights routine too. In addition, I try to schedule one or two meetings or Skype calls to help people each day.

> “If your entire ego and identity is vested in your startup, where there are certainly factors outside of your control, you can get into a depressive funk that affects your ability to function. So, you should also, let’s say, join a rock climbing gym. Try to improve your time in the mile. Something like that. I recommend at least one physical activity. Then even if everything goes south — you have some horrible divorce agreement with your co-founder — if you had a good week and set a personal record in the gym or on the track or wherever, that can still be a good week.”

## 5 things that seem essential that we launched Buffer without
[Link](http://blog.bufferapp.com/5-things-that-seem-essential-that-we-launched-buffer-without)

When I first went about creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Buffer, there was something I kept very clear in my mind.

> Most entrepreneurs’ instincts for what is the minimum viable product are like 10 times off. So, maybe you’re one of those rare entrepreneurs who has that gut instinct for creating an MVP, but just in case, just check out whether it’s possible that you could accomplish your strategy and learn something interesting with half the features, and maybe if you want to be really bold with half again, and just imagine: what would that look like for customers?

As a result, I had in my mind the whole time when I was putting together the first version of Buffer: how can I go even more minimal here? In fact, as we have grown, we have also incorporated this into the culture with a key point of our “Be a ‘no ego’ doer” value to often asking ourselves the question “what can we do right now?”

I’ll even admit that with all of this knowledge and even while I kept asking myself “do I really need this?” I was headed clearly along a path of launching with far too many features. In the end, I luckily had committed to a “November Startup Sprint” concept on Hacker News where a group of people had all committed to build and launch something within November.

*A paid feature mentioned on the pricing page: your own bit.ly details for analytics.* bit.ly was an advertised feature for the paid plan, yet without launching I had no idea if anyone would pay for Buffer, so it made a lot of sense not to build the feature: I had little validation for it! I was lucky that the first paying customer was after 3 days, but they didn’t ask me about the bit.ly feature, so I still didn’t build it.

When the second customer started paying for Buffer, I remember them emailing me and asking me about a text box for his bit.ly details that “did nothing” when he filled it out. So, I quickly fixed that and emailed him back to say “try now”. In hindsight this was a great way to validate before building.

*Automatic upgrade and immediate access to paid plan features after paying.* An auto-upgrade process is one of those things that would be easy to think is essential when you’re charing for a product. What an awful experience it would be if they had to wait until I upgraded them manually myself. 

I was using PayPal and as many will know their Instant Payment Notification (IPN) system is not the easiest to code in order to have auto-upgrade for customers who pay. When someone upgraded, I got a standard “someone sent you money” email from PayPal and then rushed to the database to manually upgrade them.

This could be seen as an awful experience and very damaging. The crazy thing? The result was quite the opposite. This “issue” actually triggered an interaction between me and these users, and made them super loyal. People loved to chat with the founder.

*Change email, forgotten password, delete account.* I think these are features that do very little to help you learn and validate whether people have a need for your product. If they might add any delay at all to your launch, do without them!

*Static pages: about page, terms of use, privacy policy.* These are those kinds of tasks when working on your not-yet-launched startup. It is so tempting to have everything looking nice and tidy for the launch, but these pages are so standard and won’t help you validate whether anyone will use your product. Showing that there is a human behind the product can be a benefit, but I’d just advise that you add a link to your Twitter profile in the footer instead of building fancy pages.

*The goal here? To learn.* You can build something pretty or make the code super clean if you want to, but that will just be an exercise for yourself at this point. What will help you to validate the idea and see whether you should continue along this same path is to get the product in front of users and talk with them and observe what they do. Do they understand it? If they understand it, is it useful for them? Stay laser focused on these questions.
