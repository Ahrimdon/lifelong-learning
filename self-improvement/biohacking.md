- Good mood, confidence, focus, energy, willpower, stress resilience, brainpower, calm, health...
- REM sleep: `ouraring.com`
- Block blue light before you sleep using glasses. `https://gunnar.com/`
- Have your bedroom dark as possible. `Chilipad`.
- Wake up at exactly the same time each morning.
- Evaluate things that seem to help or disrupt sleep.
- Optimal nutrition:
  - Minimize insulin, maximize glucose disposal, optimize various growth factors towards things we want, and away from what we don't want.
  - Do not eat sugar in any form.
  - No processed food.
  - No cheap industrially-farmed animal products.
  - Mostly plants.
  - Organic when possible.
  - No alcohol or no salt.
  - **I do intermittent fasting where for 3 days a week, I eat only once a day.** This is surprisingly easy after the first couple of times.
  - Ketogenic but that is hard.
- Optimal exercise
  - Hip hinge exercise--deadlift, squat, leg press. This activates the largest muscles in your body--much more gain than exercising small muscles like the biceps.
  - HIIT.
  - Minimize sitting.
  - 2-3x a week gym with 15 min warmup, 45 min hip-hinge exercise, 30–45 min other muscle groups in order of declining size.
  - 2–3x a week on non-gym days 20-min HIIT run: 5 min warmup, 8 sets of 20–30 sec all-out, 60–90 sec walking, 5 min warmdown. If you do it right, you feel close to sick after this.
- Mental Health
  - Meditation definitely works.
  - Psychotherapy. "How do I enhance my intelligence?" "How do I eliminate bad mood days?" "How do I find it easy to always chat with girls I find attractive?"
  - Never lie about anything to anyone.
- Medical testing:
  - Discover your bugs and fix them if possible.
    - Blood testing.
    - Genetic testing.
    - Biomarkers.
- Supplements
  - Metformin: anti-diabetes drug that lowers blood sugar.
  - Lithium: mood stabilizer. Lithium carbonate.
  - Modafinil. 100-200 mg/day.
  - SSRI antidepressants. 10mg escitalopram daily.
  - Thyroid hormones.
  - Growth hormone.
  - Estrogen blocker.
  - Phenibut.
  - MDMA.
  - A LOT.

## How you move defines how you live
[Reference](http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live)

- Lifespan: delaying the onset of atherosclerotic disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease.
- Healthspan, you want to preserve these.
  - Brain: how long you can preserve cognition (executive function, processing speed, short-term memory).
  - Body: how long you can maintain muscle mass, functional movement and strength, flexibility, freedom from pain.
  - Spirit: how robust is your social support network and your sense of purpose.
- Ancestors: reproductive survival, ensuring you lived long enough to reproduce. Natural selection would prioritize short-term survival over long-term survival or quality of life.
- Stress is helpful, because you need it to fend off an animal trying to attack you, or hunting for food in a state of starvation. Nothing about our evolutionary development selected for equanimity (peace of mind). I argue that our current environment places sufficient non-evolutionary stress on us. We now have the luxury of aspiring to things our ancestors could never dream of. They were preoccupied with reproducing and not dying, we aspire to play with our great grandchildren.
- Life really sucked for someone living a hundred years ago. My worst day didn't really matter. Technology traded acute problems (lethal infections, starvation, trauma, war) and traded them for chronic ones (lower back pain, heart attacks, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's).
- I think of our modern lives as a great power, or a great privilege, to be more accurate. I love the Internet, agriculture, crop domestication, antibiotics.
- Hacks: meditation, intermittent fasting, heavy compound joint and hip-hinge training, intense interval training, body work, supplements, drugs, introspection, sleep hygiene.

### Movement
- **What we need are examples of how real people can be empowered to preserve muscle mass, move functionally, maintain freedom from pain, and be the best athletes of their lives.**
- An "athlete of life" can hip-hinge, squat, carry, shift, push, pull, rotate, and anti-rotate with confidence and fluidity.

- A very proactive strategy is necessary to offset orthopedic injuries as we age.
- In some cases, the injuries are brought on by years of overuse.

## How to biohack your intelligence — with everything from sex to Modafinil to MDMA

- Intelligence: Ability to accomplish complex goals.
  - Classical: Logic, problem solving, creativity, strategy.
  - Applied: Energy, focus, willpower, emotional control.
  - Social: Persuasiveness, empathy, social skills.
  - Dynamic: Ability to learn, memory, knowledge.
- Modafinil, SSRI, MDMA, hormone signaling, mitochondria-enhancing exercise.
- Get into flow state every day: fix sleep, do intermittent fasting, get hormones to optimal levels, use Modafinil, build the right habits, high quality deep downtime.
- Make ourselves immune to stress (meditation, lithium, SSRIs), eliminate distractions, build the right habits over time.
- Suggestion: find one hour of deep work every day.
- Investments:
  - Obsessively thinking about the reasons we did not hit our deep work goals and fixing them.
  - Social intelligence. This is mainly like practicing body language in front of a mirror, reading the right books, writing persuasive articles.
  - Dynamic intelligence (learning to learn) + classical intelligence (IQ). Nutrients like Mg, choline, EPA, Curcumin, Bacopa Monieri. Interval training. Intermittent fasting. LSD.

### On bad sleep:

- Lowered emotional control, stress resilience, willpower and focus. Significant increase in procrastination.
- Hormonal misregulation.
- Reduced immunity.
- Lower ability to remember what you learned the prior day.
- Worsened cognition and ability to see creative non-trivial solutions.
- Less able to read facial expressions, rated less attractive.
- Worsened clearance of waste from brain.

### On stress:

- Lithium.
- Meditation.
- Ruthlessly remove negative people from life.
- Testing our hormones.
- Eating once a day?
  - Major health benefits by promoting autophagy.
  - Saves time.
  - Prevents the afternoon slump.
  - Directly enhances intelligence.

### Social Intelligence

- Body language, eye contact, voice tonality. Looking and acting dominant enhances our persuasion effectiveness.
- Beta blockers.
- To be aggressive, do some pushups. To be more calm, meditate.

### On Avoiding Pollution

- Air filter mask?
- Don't drink hot liquids from plastic containers, avoid plastics near your food.
- Eat expensive local/organic food.
- Don't smoke.
