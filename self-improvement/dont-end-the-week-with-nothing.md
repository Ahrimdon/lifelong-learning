it is in that employee's personal interest to stop selling hours of labor and start renting access to his accumulated capital as soon as humanly possible.

I don't mean just monetary capital -- having $100,000 in your 401k is awesome but that's not the type which is really interesting to me, simply because rates of return on that sort of capital are so low. There are many types of capital that are no less real just because you can't conveniently reduce them to a number.

Human capital -- the skills you've built up over time and the value you're able to create as a result of them.

Social capital -- the ability to call on someone who trusts you and have them do something in your interest, like e.g. recommend you to a job.

Reputational capital -- the way your name rings out in rooms you aren't even in, simply when your topic of expertise comes up. (Hopefully in a good way!)

If company loyalty were a bankable proposition (and it might still be at some places -- I know a smaller company or two where "we treat our employees like family" means exactly what it says on the tin), you'd get a wee bit of capital every week you worked.

Don't end the week with nothing. Prefer to work on things you can show. Prefer to work where people can see you. Prefer to work on things you can own.

#### Prefer Working On Things You Can Show

One of the reasons developers have embraced OSS so much is because it gives you portable capital between companies: if your work is sitting on Github, even if you leave one job, you can take it with you to your next job.

One of the great wrinkles that OSS throws into this is that OSS is public by default, and that's game changing.

Why? Because when your work is in public, you can show it to people. That's often the best way to demonstrate that you're capable of doing work like it.

Telling people you can do great work is easy: any idiot can do it, and many idiots do. Having people tell people you do great work is an improvement.

Work you can show off, though, is prima facie evidence of your skills. After your portfolio includes it, your ability to sell your skills gets markedly better. Given that most people's net worth is almost 100% invested in their personal capital (i.e. if you're a young engineer the net present value of all future salary absolutely swamps everything in your bank account), this is a fairly radical improvement in your present situation for not a very radical change in how you go about things.

Thus my first piece of advice: if you have the choice between multiple jobs, all else being equal, pick the one where you are able to show what you've worked on. This could mean working on a language stack where work biproducts are customarily OSSed (e.g. Rails) versus one which isn't (e.g. C#). This could mean working on particular projects within the organization which like external visibility (e.g. Android) rather than projects which don't (e.g. AdWords plumbing -- presumably Google will pay you a lot of money to do that, but consider it compensation for not being able to talk about it). This could mean working in industries which default to being open rather than those which default to being closed.

OSS isn't nearly the only way to be able to show what you've worked on. In the creative industries, where the end product is customer-visible, people keep very close eye on whose name ends up in the credits. Academics spend lots of time worrying about citation counts and directed graphs.

More prosaically, establish an expectation early that you're simply going to talk about what you're doing. I think at Fog Creek / Stack Exchange they call this "producing artifacts" -- conference presentations, blog posts, OSSed software, and the like, centered around the work. Even at very open companies there exists lots of secret sauce, but most of the valuable work of the company is not particularly sensitive, and much of it has widely generalizable lessons.

Some of my most effective writing in terms of career growth was back in 2006 through 2008, when I was struggling through not understanding anything I was doing, and where I -- quite literally -- had less readers than my younger brother's blog on writing superhero novels. Why was toiling in Internet-obscurity still valuable? Because I was able to point to particular experiments that I started in e.g. 2008, and then point to the followups in 2009 and 2010, which showed those experiments were really successful.

*If you cannot build things you can show at work, you should build things you can show outside of work.*

I offered them this in exchange: "If you let me continue working on these, I'm going to learn lots of skills which I can put to the use of the company. Normally you invest lots of money sending engineers to conferences and professional training. This is even better for you: I'll learn more with no operating expenditure and no decrease in billing efficiency." That's an offer you can make to substantially any employer.

I prefer being upfront with people rather than doing the "It is easier to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission" route a lot of folks suggest. Sure, you can just roll the dice and pretend your employer is unlikely to notice your side project. Unfortunately, the odds of them noticing your side project go up sharply if the side project is ever successful, and then your lack of forthrightness about it give you unbounded liability extending far into the future. Just ask. The worst they can say is "No."

You might consider asking in the context of a more general compensation discussion than just "Hey boss, can I work on OSS?" That way, if they say "No side projects", you'll say "OK, in lieu of the side projects, I'll need more money." It's easier to be sticklers for the stock agreements when there's absolutely no cost to the company to insist on the usual boilerplate, but minor concessions on the boilerplate are often easier than concessions on things which actually appear on the company's books.

#### Prefer To Work Where People Can See You

How do you develop that profile? I'd suggest, all things being equal, working at places and on projects which have above-average visibility.

You don't have to optimize for "sexy" projects. You know, sexy projects: I don't know how to describe them but I know it when I see it. Most engineering work isn't intrinsically sexy. I would, however, optimize for impact and visibility.

Don't try to make a career out of optimizing the SQL queries to display a preference page on a line of business app at a company that no one has ever heard of. That is not the straightforward path to having other people learn you are capable of doing meaningful work. Instead, work at higher profile companies/organizations -- AmaGooFaceSoft, startups or small companies with anomalously high profile (locally, nationally, whatever), or in positions where by your nature you're exposed to lots of people.

An observation: every developer evangelist I know goes into a much better job right after they quit being an evangelist. This is not true of other engineering jobs with checkered reputations, like e.g. The Build Guy. Why do developer evangelists get upgrades but The Build Guy(s) not? My bet is because evangelists literally spent years meeting thousands of people and showing them "Hey, I'm going to live code in front of you while also making my employers fat stacks of money. You run a company and could use both engineers and money. You should probably remember my name, you know, just in case."

If you cannot gain exposure at your day job, try to get some exposure outside of it. Network actively. Go to local meetups of technical folks, but also go to the (often separate) events where the business side of your industry talks shops. Speak at conferences. Take the things you have created (see above) and actively show them to people to solicit feedback. You don't have to have an audience of thousands for an audience to be worthwhile -- for landing a new job, having an audience of one hiring manager is a darn sight better than having no audience at all. Blog and collect an email list. It's old and hackneyed advice but it freaking works, particularly when you can compound improvements over years.

Amy Hoy has a great metaphor for this -- "stacking the bricks". Seen from the outside, you might say "That person with an impressive career? It's like they have a sheer wall made out of awesome. I could not hope to ever have a wall like that." Seen from the inside, it looks like one day of delivering a single good conference talk, a few weeks spent writing an OSS library, another day writing the definitive blog post on getting multiple Ruby versions playing together, a few months shipping a product used by many people, an hour recording a podcast. Brick by brick, stone by stone, the wall gets higher.

#### Prefer To Work On Things You Can Keep

The employer/employee relationship is generally "You give us an hour and, in return, we give you some consideration for that hour." As an employee, you very rarely get to keep hours, bank them against the future, or have them redound to your benefit years later.

I'm not generally a fan of the Silicon Valley model, but I'll say this in their defense: widespread employee ownership of the enterprise is one of the single best innovations in the history of capitalism. Non-managerial employees own plus or minus 20% of Twitter, Facebook, etc. They own plus or minus "rounding error" of almost all other publicly traded companies, with very rare exceptions.

I think that's an improvement on the "no shared stake" model of employment, but I don't think it is the last word in it. For one thing, it overconcentrates employee wealth with one company. As an employee, your short-term cash flow generation is tied to the continued health of your employer. If a large portion of your net worth is tied to their stock, you're magnifying the impact of a secular or firm-specific shock should one occur. (This is, relatedly, why I'm not a fan of buying the stock of an employer in a company-sponsored DRIP or IRA. You've got plenty of exposure to their future already without buying more of it with your own money.)

The explicit understanding among professional investors is that 90% of all shares of early-stage startups are worthless. It seems more than a little self-serving for professional investors to tell employees "While our general partners would laugh us out of the room if we suggested betting the entire fund on a single investment, even if we thought it was a sure thing, you are going the be the lucky ones and you should certainly have 99% of your net worth tied up in the illiquid shares of one particular company."

There's another, harder option with higher returns: the side project. You can "buy" them with sweat equity, one bead at a time. They provide you with many benefits, including the direct financial benefits (if you sell things to people for money, you get money, which can be useful), the compounded benefits of investing the financial benefits.

There's also intangible -- but no less real -- benefits to having an artifact which is yours. This is one reason why, while I love OSS, I would suggest people not immediately throw their OSS on Github. That makes it very easy for developers to consume your code, but it does not make it easy for you to show the impact of that code to other people, particularly to non-technical stakeholders. To the extent that people's lives are meaningfully improved by your code, the credit (and observable citations) often goes to Github rather than going to you. If you're going to spend weeks or months of time writing meaningful OSS libraries, make a stand-alone web presence for them.
