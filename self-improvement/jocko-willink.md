[Reference](http://www.businessinsider.com/retired-navy-seal-jocko-willink-nightly-routine-2017-11)

- Discipline equals freedom.
- Prepare gym clothes.
- Literally anything that qualifies as exercise when you wake up.
- Make tomorrow's to-do list.
- Elevate your legs.
- Ignore office free food.

## Extreme Ownership

- Operant conditioning: people have to know what they are being punished or rewarded for.
- **The enemy gets a vote.** Even if your plan goes well, they will still figure out a way to disrupt it. This is why simplicity is key. If a plan is complex, an enemy can adjust to it. Everything is super simple.
- You have to align your company goals with employee goals.

### Chapter 7: Prioritize and Execute

- Big Tough Frogman: Substantial physical exertion and great risk.
- No calling in additional troops and putting them at risk unless we took serious casualties and needed them.
- Sledgehammer to break the wall.
- Prioritize and execute.
  - Get into the best spot tactically.
  - Find a way to get everyone off the exposed rooftop and get to the wounded man.
  - Ensure head count.
- We want to make sure that the highest priority thing really IS the highest priority.

### Chapter 8: Decentralized Command

- Decentralized command: train your subordinates so you can focus on the bigger picture.
- No person has the ability to figure out everything happening on a complex battlefield at the same time.
- 4-6 SEALs per squad. Platoon = 3 squads.
- They were able to avoid fratricide by counting the buildings and confirming that they would be shooting at SEALs, not enemies. Even if the subordinate officer wanted to hit the building.
- Junior leaders must understand what's in their decision making authority.
- Mission statement has to tie into strategic goals for the small squad.
- Span of control = where one person can truly lead them.

### Chapter 9: Plan

- Planning begins with mission analysis. Leaders must identify clear directives for the team.
- Briefing: most junior man can fully understand the operation.
- You can let the junior men add details to the plan so you can see it from a greater distance.
- Same terminologies/they must be interchangeable.

### Chapter 10: Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command

- Routine strategy briefing so people won't get demotivated.
- Extreme ownership: informing the CO of what exactly is going to happen. "I can bitch about their operations and scrutiny, but at the end of the day, it gets us no closer to getting our operations approved."
- Just give the CO the information they need so they are also in the comfort zone.
- If the chain of command had questions about my plans, it was not their fault, it was our fault. If our boss isn't comfortable with what I am doing, it was only because I had not clearly communicated it to him.

### Chapter 11: Decisiveness amid Uncertainty

- Just fire people if they backbite each other because they won't serve as good leaders.

### Chapter 12: Discipline Equals Freedom

- Getting disciplined with collecting evidence = they eventually became faster and they stored evidence faster, even though at first most people didn't want to change.
- You have to make time by getting up early.
- Those at work before everyone else were the ones who were considered the best operators.
- Being disciplined allowed them to be more creative and have the freedom to work within the framework of our disciplined procedures.
- Principle: every leader walks a fine line, that's what makes leadership so challenging. Leaders should not seek recognition, they must be confident enough to follow someone else when the situation calls for it.
- Be aggressive but not overbearing. Encourage people to come forth with an opposing view.
- Calm but not robotic.
- Confident but never cocky. Confidence is contagious, a great attribute for a leader and a team.
- Brave but not reckless. Mitigate risks that can be controlled.
- Competitive spirit but also be gracious losers. They must drive competition and push themselves and their teams to perform at the highest level. But they must never put their drive for personal success ahead of overall mission success for the greater team. Leaders must act with professionalism and recognize others for their contributions.
- Attentive to details but not obsessed by them.
- Strong but have endurance. The ability to perform at the highest level and sustain that level for the long term.
- Humble but no passive, quiet but not silent. Admit mistakes and failures, take ownership of them, and figure out a way to prevent them from happening again.
- Be close with subordinates but not too close. Understand the motivations of their team members and know their people--their lives and their families.
- Extreme Ownership/Decentralized Command.
- Nothing to prove but everything to prove. Do not gloat or revel in his or her position. Since the leader is de facto in charge, the leader has nothing to prove.
- But in another respect, as leader has everything to prove: every member of the team must develop the trust and confidence that their leader will exercise good jugment, remain calm, and make the right decisions when it matters most. **Leaders must earn that respect and prove themselves worthy, demonstrating through action that they will take care of the team and look out for their long-term interests and well-being.**

### Afterword

- Senior leaders simply had the courage to accept and run with them.
- EO is a mindset, an attitude. If leaders exhibit EO and develop a culture of EO within their teams and organizations, the rest falls into place.
- The goal of all leaders should be to work themselves out of a job. This means leaders must be heavily engaged in training and mentoring their junior leaders to prepare them to step up and assume greater responsibilities.
- All leaders make mistakes. Handling those mistakes with humility is the key.
