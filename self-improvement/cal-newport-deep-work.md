## Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World

- **Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.**
- Indeed, if you study the lives of other influential figures from both distant and recent history, you’ll find that a commitment to deep work is a common theme.
- Montaigne: Worked in a private library he built in the souther tower. Mark Twain: wrote Tom Sawyer in a shed.
- Woody Allen: Never owned a computer. Instead, he completed all his writing on a German typewriter.
- Bill Gates: "Think Week", where he would isolate himself to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.
- Network tools: email, social media, infotainment (BuzzFeed, Reddit). Fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. They are also not loafing?
- They are doing shallow work: non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
- Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.
- **Our work culture's shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth.**
- Lock himself in a room with no computer: just textbooks. Free from electronic distraction.
- Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that has great value today.
- If you can create something useful, its reachable audience is limitless. But if what you're producing is mediocre, then it's too easy for your audience to find something better.
- In an industrial economy, there was a small, skilled labor and professional class for which deep work was crucial, but most workers could do just fine without it.
- **The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.**
- In the ten-year period following my college graduation, I published four books, earned a PhD, wrote peer-reviewed academic papers at a high rate, and was hired as a tenure-track professor at Georgetown University. I maintained this voluminous production while rarely working past five or six p.m. during the workweek.
- The ability to fully disconnect allows me to be present with my wife/two sons and read a number of books.

### Deep Work is Valuable

- “We are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring,” Brynjolfsson and McAfee explain early in their book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.”
- Brynjolfsson and McAfee call the group personified by Nate Silver the “high-skilled” workers. Advances such as robotics and voice recognition are automating many low-skilled positions, but as these economists emphasize, “other technologies like data visualization, analytics, high speed communications, and rapid prototyping have augmented the contributions of more abstract and data-driven reasoning, increasing the values of these jobs.” In other words, those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive.
- Winner take all: talent is not something you can buy in bulk. People will pay for the best talent.

#### How to Become a Winner in the New Economy

- The ability to quickly master hard things.
  - If you can't learn, you can't thrive.
- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
- These both depend on your ability to perform deep work.
- To learn requires intense concentration.
- Important to be super focused because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.
- Batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches.
- The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration—radically reducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the quality of their results.
- To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. If you’re not comfortable going deep for extended periods of time, it’ll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally. Unless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your competition, the deep workers among them will outproduce you.

### Deep Work is Rare

- Open office = collaboration but are also distracting. Same with real-time messaging.
- Principle of Least Resistance: If you can't count on the principle of quick responses, you'd instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while.
- Feynman: Was probably bad at responding to emails, but clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.
- Busyness as a proxy for productivity: in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive, many knowledge workers turn back towards an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
- It is not about being visible productive, it is about being productive. Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that's often at odds with busyness.

### Deep Work is Meaningful

- The connection between deep work and a good life is familiar and widely accepted when considering the world of craftsmen. The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy.
- After a bad or disrupting occurrence in your life, what you choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward. These simple choices can provide a "reset button" to your emotions.
- Hypothesis: the elderly subjects who were happier had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive.
- Spend enough mind in the state of deep work, and your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance.
- Shallow concerns vie for your attention in a knowledge work setting. Some are benign, some are stressful, some are frustrating, some are explicitly negative.
- **When you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right.**
- Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
- Craftsmanship: the woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood he works. The task of a craftsman is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.
- **We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.**

### Work Deeply

- Eudaimonia Machine: Gallery (examples of deep work), salon (for curiosity), library (a record of all work done in the machine), office space, deep work chamber.
- People fight desires all day long: eating, sleeping, sex, checking e-mail/social networking, surfing the web, listening to music, watching television.
- You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.
- The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.
- Donald Knuth's email address: "I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration."
- Monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling: eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.
- Neal Stephenson: "If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those chunks get separated and fragmented, my productivity as a novelist drops spectacularly.
- Carl Jung: bimodal philosophy, dividing your time to have some deep work, and some shallow work. He believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity.
- Seinfeld: "The way to be a better comic is to write better jokes, and the way to create better jokes is to write every day." Chain method.
- Generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep.
- Vague commitment to deep work: It needed to happen in ninety-minute chunks. He made a rule that he would wake up and start working by five thirty every morning. He would then work until seven thirty, make breakfast, and go to work already done with his dissertation obligations for the day.
- "Who's to say that I can't be that prolific? Why not me?"
- Problem with rhythmic philosophy: you still have to respond to the boss's email.
- Ritualize:
  - Every placed book, every placed notebook, what he puts on his wall, what he wears to the office: everything is specified by a routine that has varied little. "I train myself to be organized."
  - Charles Darwin: Wake at the same time, then eat breakfast alone, then retire to his study, then reading letters, then he would think about ideas while walking on a proscribed route and then circled a path around his property.
  - "Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants."
  - Great minds didn't deploy rituals to be weird; they did so because success in their work depended on their ability to go deep, again and again. Their rituals minimized the friction in this transition to depth, allowing them to go deep more easily and stay in the state longer.
- Ritual:
  - Where you'll work and for how long.
  - How you'll work once you start to work.
  - How you'll support your work: coffee, exercise.
  - Gesture: J.K. Rowling checked into a luxurious hotel (big change in normal environment) dedicated towards supporting a deep work task. You then think of an increased perceived importance of the task.
  - Alan Lightman: retreats each summer to a "tiny island" in Maine to think deeply and recharge.
  - Writing cabins..
  - Inventing the transistor: he locked himself in a room until he had a better design.
  - Writing while up in the air?
  - Psychology: committing so seriously to the task at hand. Putting yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project.
- Professors at MIT: want the ability to close themselves off. We have the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and the fully collaborative thinker in an open office.
- Hub and spoke: areas of deep work around areas of collaboration.

### 4 Disciplines of Execution

- Focus on the wildly important.
  - Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours.
  - Have a specific goal that should return tangible and substantial professional benefits.
  - Don't try to say "no" to the distractions but say "yes" to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing.
- Act on the lead measures.
  - Lag = things like papers published per year, the task has to be done first.
  - Lead = amount of deep work, since you do this before the task.
- Keep a compelling scoreboard.
  - Physical artifact in the workspace that displays the individual's current deep work count.
- Cadence of accountability.
  - Team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions, and describe what happened with the commitments they made at a last meeting.

### Why a Shutdown Is Good

- *Downtime aids insights.* Distracted group performed better before doing a complex decision regarding a car purchase.
  - For decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague constraints, your unconscious mind is well-suited to tackle the issue.
- *Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply.* The nature advantage: taking a walk around nature performs better. Spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate? Walking on busy city streets requires you to use directed attention, but walking around nature exposes you to inherently fascinating stimuli.
  - Not even because of having a good mood. When they tried harsh winter, they still ended up doing better on concentration tasks.
  - Relaxing activities: casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run play the same attention-restoring role as walking in nature.
  - Only the confidence that you're done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow.
- Elite violinists: deliberate practice is done for about 3 hours. The less accomplished players spent less time in a state of depth. By evening, you're beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the night won't be the type of high-value activities, but will be shallow tasks.
- Shutdown ritual: every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each, you have confirmed that either you have a plan or it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right.
- **There will always be tasks left incomplete.** The idea that you can ever reach a point where all your obligations are handled is a fantasy. However if you commit to a plan for a goal, it may not only achieve that goal, but it may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits.
- Regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, you work hard. When you're done, be done.

## Embrace Boredom

- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. The idea might sound obvious but it represents a departure from how people understand such matters.
- You know that undistracted concentration is important. You know that you need to exercise your mental muscle.
- Constant attention switching online has a lasting negative effect on your brain.
- Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, it's hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate.
- Goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction.
- Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead, take breaks from focus.
- The use of a distracting service does not reduce your brain's ability to focus. It's instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.
- By segregating Internet use, you're minimizing the number of times you give in to distraction, and by doing so, you let these attention-selecting muscles strengthen.
- It's like you will have Internet blocks and no Internet blocks.
- **You must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli**
- Teddy Roosevelt: When he is working on schoolwork, he is doing so with blistering intensity. Working with great intensity: no email breaks, no daydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no repeated trips to the coffee machine.
- Productive meditation: a period where you are occupied physically, but not mentally--walking, jogging, driving, showering, and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem.
