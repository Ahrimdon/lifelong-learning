## Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World

- **Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.**
- Indeed, if you study the lives of other influential figures from both distant and recent history, you’ll find that a commitment to deep work is a common theme.
- Montaigne: Worked in a private library he built in the souther tower. Mark Twain: wrote Tom Sawyer in a shed.
- Woody Allen: Never owned a computer. Instead, he completed all his writing on a German typewriter.
- Bill Gates: "Think Week", where he would isolate himself to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.
- Network tools: email, social media, infotainment (BuzzFeed, Reddit). Fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. They are also not loafing?
- They are doing shallow work: non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
- Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.
- **Our work culture's shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth.**
- Lock himself in a room with no computer: just textbooks. Free from electronic distraction.
- Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that has great value today.
- If you can create something useful, its reachable audience is limitless. But if what you're producing is mediocre, then it's too easy for your audience to find something better.
- In an industrial economy, there was a small, skilled labor and professional class for which deep work was crucial, but most workers could do just fine without it.
- **The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.**
- In the ten-year period following my college graduation, I published four books, earned a PhD, wrote peer-reviewed academic papers at a high rate, and was hired as a tenure-track professor at Georgetown University. I maintained this voluminous production while rarely working past five or six p.m. during the workweek.
- The ability to fully disconnect allows me to be present with my wife/two sons and read a number of books.

### Deep Work is Valuable

- “We are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring,” Brynjolfsson and McAfee explain early in their book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.”
- Brynjolfsson and McAfee call the group personified by Nate Silver the “high-skilled” workers. Advances such as robotics and voice recognition are automating many low-skilled positions, but as these economists emphasize, “other technologies like data visualization, analytics, high speed communications, and rapid prototyping have augmented the contributions of more abstract and data-driven reasoning, increasing the values of these jobs.” In other words, those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive.
- Winner take all: talent is not something you can buy in bulk. People will pay for the best talent.

#### How to Become a Winner in the New Economy

- The ability to quickly master hard things.
  - If you can't learn, you can't thrive.
- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
- These both depend on your ability to perform deep work.
- To learn requires intense concentration.
- Important to be super focused because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.
- Batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches.
- The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration—radically reducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the quality of their results.
- To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. If you’re not comfortable going deep for extended periods of time, it’ll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally. Unless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your competition, the deep workers among them will outproduce you.

### Deep Work is Rare

- Open office = collaboration but are also distracting. Same with real-time messaging.
- Principle of Least Resistance: If you can't count on the principle of quick responses, you'd instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while.
- Feynman: Was probably bad at responding to emails, but clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.
- Busyness as a proxy for productivity: in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive, many knowledge workers turn back towards an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
- It is not about being visible productive, it is about being productive. Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that's often at odds with busyness.

### Deep Work is Meaningful

- The connection between deep work and a good life is familiar and widely accepted when considering the world of craftsmen. The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy.
- After a bad or disrupting occurrence in your life, what you choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward. These simple choices can provide a "reset button" to your emotions.
- Hypothesis: the elderly subjects who were happier had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive.
- Spend enough mind in the state of deep work, and your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance.
- Shallow concerns vie for your attention in a knowledge work setting. Some are benign, some are stressful, some are frustrating, some are explicitly negative.
- **When you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right.**
- Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
- Craftsmanship: the woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood he works. The task of a craftsman is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.
- **We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.**
