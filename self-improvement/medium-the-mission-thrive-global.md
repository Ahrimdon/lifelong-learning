## Surround Yourself with People Who Hold You to a Higher Standard than You Hold Yourself
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/surround-yourself-with-people-who-hold-you-to-a-higher-standard-than-you-hold-yourself-96f12c186375)

- People select their friends based on proximity more than anything else.
- In a college classroom, you do not make friends exactly with those who share similar interests, but those who you literally sit next to.
- A person's economic mobility is highly determined by the country they live in.
- Do your close friends hold you to a high standard? Or do they hold you to an even lower standard than you hold yourself?
- Most people are willing to tolerate unhealthy relationships, poor finances, and jobs they hate. If not so, those things wouldn't be in their lives.
- If your environment radically contradicts the goals you're trying to pursue, your life will always be an uphill battle.
- Ex: buying a new car, after getting it and posting videos of the car, he got 2000 friend requests, higher sales of his real estate education products, he was seen as "credible". Driving around in the coolest car made him feel awesome.
- *Precognition: that you can predict your own psychological/emotional state by targeting biological or environmental stimuli.*
  - This is why you work in environments that create amazing feelings.
  - He was seeing the fruits of his labors.
  - He was consciously generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in real-tie. He created an environment that was now creating him.
  - These fruits added even more confidence, creating a continuous confidence building feedback loop.
- *Confidence does not come from owning a Tesla. But the external and the internal play off each other. When you change your external environment, it alters your psychology, which then can loop back to continuing to enhance the environment in a virtuous upward cycle.*

### Surround Yourself with People Who Transform You

- Hired Ryan Holiday to help me with the book, when I send him a draft, he shows how it could be 10x better, and he holds me to that standard.
- It's more that I don't know what I don't know. Working with Ryan has streamlined my understanding of what is possible and what it takes to create something powerful.
- **By investing in what you're doing, you'll experience the psychological shift needed to achieve your goals.** Once invested, your identity towards what you are doing changes. You've put yourself physically, not just emotionally, in a position where you must move forward.
- **Surrounding yourself with people who have higher standards than you is the fastest way to change. If you don't change your environment, and instead attempt to overcome your environment through willpower, you'll lose every time.**

- Same with romantic relationships. Do they help you more than you become more than you currently are? Do you help them?
- 20% of people are moving forward, 60% mimics, and 20% is moving backward.
- You've been around people who, simply by being around them, elevated your thinking and energy. Those are the kinds of people you need to surround yourself with. Those are the kinds of people you need to be like yourself, so that others are better simply by being around you.
- **The quality of your life and the quality of your work is determined by the standards you have for yourself, and the standards of those around you. If you're fine doing mediocre work, then those around you are as well.**

## I Quit Social Media For 30 Days and Here’s What I Learned
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/i-quit-social-media-for-30-days-and-heres-what-i-learned-930795e784ef)

- Aziz: "Whenever you check for a new post on Instagram or whenever you go on The New York Times to see if there's a new thing, it's not even about the content. It's just about seeing a new thing. You get addicted to that feeling."
- *What have I lost from the last decade of my life in exchange for a whole bunch of probably obsessive checking of Facebook?*
- Facebook--for sharing big news, for information recall.
- Books--after quitting social media, you'll miss reading them.

## Why Most People Will Never Be Successful
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-never-be-successful-632bb24fa5c3)

- Your days must consistently be spent on high quality activities. The more successful you become--which is balancing the few essential things (spiritual, relational, financial, physical) in your life and removing everything else, the less you can justify low quality.
- As your vision for yourself expands, you realize you have to make certain adjustments. You need to cut-back on spending all of your money and time on crap and entertainment.
- Not about perfection, not about being busy all the time.
- **How you do anything is how you do everything.** This only makes sense for people who have removed everything from their lives they hate. Your daily and normal life can only be filled with those things you highly value.
- When your days are filled with only those core essentials that mean the world to you, you will dominate in "all" areas of your life. Because the only things in your life are the things you highly value. (This is hard!)
- "A lot of people don’t do well simply because they major in minor things." Said another way, most people are caught in the thick of thin things.

## Mediocrity is a Virus. Here’s How to Banish it from Your Life.
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/mediocrity-is-a-virus-heres-how-to-banish-it-from-your-life-52a618c93391)

- When you justify and allow even little things into your life which your intuition warns you against, you permit a virus to enter your life. It spreads to other areas.
- Going against your higher intuitive voice is a slippery-slope. You don’t realize day to day how out of whack things are really getting.
- "A private victory always precedes a public victory." — Stephen R. Covey
- "When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food." — James Allen
- If you want to improve your finances, you have to change your desires about money. You can’t continue to enjoy spending money on the crap you spend it on. You can’t continue to be content always being stressed about money.
- If you no longer desire mediocrity, you won't be mediocre. Herein lies a subtle and disarming truth — everything you have in your life is what you want. If you wanted something different, you'd have something different. As James Allen wrote, your circumstances reveal you.
- If you really wanted to believe something different, you'd be actively seeking to learn, to alter, and to replace your current set of beliefs.
- You'd no longer justify your behavior. You'd be more open, honest, and authentic about where you're at. Ironically, you’d also be more accepting of where you’re at. Acceptance is the first step to commitment.
- *No excuses. If you need to learn something new, you’ll learn it. If you need to behave differently, you will. If you need a new environment, you reshape your circumstances.*
- True learning always occurs in an experiential way. It's never purely theoretical. Just like creativity rarely happens while sitting at your desk, deep and transformational learning will rarely happen within the confines of your cushy and comfortable routine.
- You'll be stunned by how low your personal standards have been. You'll be shocked what you've been willing to tolerate.
- Own your value system: most people are too concerned about what other people think to be their true selves.
- Doing burpees randomly: HE WANTS TO DO BURPEES. HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.
- Make a private decision followed by a public commitment of what you intend to do. Surround yourself with the right people who will keep you accountable.

## How To Deal With Uncomfortable Emotions And Reshape Your Identity
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-deal-with-uncomfortable-emotions-and-reshape-your-identity-34f878cf69fa)

- Pain, discomfort, shock, boredom, impostor syndrome, awkwardness, fear, being wrong, failing, ignorance, looking stupid: your avoidance of these feelings is stopping you from a life beyond your wildest imagination.
- *Wealth, optimal health, incredible relationships, and deep spiritual maturity are all available to you. But you have to pay the price to have these things. The primary obstacle in your way is how you feel about what you need to do to have these things.*
- Most people aren't willing to feel difficult emotions on a regular basis.
- When you feel the fear and do it anyways, you get the satisfaction of living life on your terms. Instead of being a hostage to your emotions, you get to experience them more deeply.
- *Hilariously, once you break past the emotional blocks and just act, it’s never as bad as you think it will be.*
- Napoleon Hill said, "When your desires are strong enough, you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve." Similarly, Tim Grover has said, "When you crave the end result, the hard work becomes irrelevant."
- *When the why is strong enough, you'll be willing to do any how. The clearer and bigger the why, thee bolder the how.*
- Taking cold showers = great practice. Even after doing it for years, I still often experience a moment of resistance.
- "Wow, I'm really doing this." Your beliefs and identity will change. They'll follow your courageous behaviors.
- Better to live in an environment you created than something created for you.
- *If you want something different, you need to act different. It doesn't matter how you feel in the moment.*

## 30 Behaviors That Will Make You Unstoppable
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/30-behaviors-that-will-make-you-unstoppable-ae749e04443e)

- Don't think, know and act. "Every right decision I have ever made has come from my gut. Every wrong decision I've made was the result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself."
- Always be prepared so you have the freedom to act on instinct. With enhanced consciousness, time will slow down for you.
- Don't be motivated by money or by anything external.
- Never be satisfied. *It is not about the goal. It's about the climb to see how far you can push yourself.* Does this make you ungrateful? Absolutely not. You’re entirely humbled and grateful for everything in your life. Which is why you will never get complacent or lazy.
- Always be in control. Act based on instinct, not impulse. Just because you could doesn't mean you do. And when you do, it's because you want to, not because you have to.
- Be true to yourself. When something isn't right in your life, change it. Immediately.
- Never let off the pressure. *You never take the pressure off yourself.*
- Don't be afraid of the consequences of failure. Whatever man.
- Don't compete with others. Make them compete with you.
- Never stop learning. *Ordinary people seek entertainment. Extraordinary people seek education and learning.*
- Success isn't enough, it only increases the pressure.
- Don't get crushed by success. There is no destination.
- Completely own it when you screw up. No blame. No deception or illusion. Just the cold hard truth. When you mess up, you own it. And as the leader, you own it when your team fails. Only with extreme ownership can you have complete freedom and control.
- Let your work speak for itself. Deep work: rare, high value, AND NOT REPLICABLE. If anyone can do it, then it is shallow work.
- *Always work on your mental strength.* "Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them." — Josh Waitzkin
- Confidence is your greatest asset. Running a marathon is far more mental than physical.
- Surround yourself with people who remind you of the future, not the past.
- Let things go, but never forget. Forgiveness improves not only your emotional health, but also your physical health.
- Have clear goals. Either on behaviors or on the outcomes you're seeking. For most people, behaviorally-focused goals are the better and more motivating option. But when you crave the results so much that the work is irrelevant, your aim should be directed straight at the outcomes you want.
- Respond immediately--he who hesitates is lost.
- Choose simplicity over complication. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
- Never be jealous or envious of someone else's accomplishments.
- Take the shot every time. If I fail more than you, I win.
- Don't get caught up in the results of your success. Always remain focused on what got you those results: the work.
- Think at 10x. *When you take your goal of earning 100K this year and change it to 1M, you're forced to operate at a different level.* Are you willing to go for 10x thinking? Are you willing to question your own thought processes and open yourself to believing an entirely different set of possibilities?
- Set goals that exceed your current capabilities. You need to aim beyond what you are capable of. You need to develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end. If your goals are logical, they won't force you to create luck. Being unstoppable means your goals challenge you to be someone more than you currently are.

## 6 Things You Need to Recover From Every Day
[Reference](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/6-things-you-need-to-recover-from-every-day-380f20a90f6c)

- Work.
  - Recovering from work: completely refraining from work-related activities and thoughts during non-work time. F email.
  - People who are successful in their work are often content being "unsuccessful" in the other areas of their lives, particularly their relationships.
- Technology.
  - Individuals who stopped staring at screens 1-2 hours before sleep: higher sleep quality and higher ability to maintain enthusiasm.
  - Try avoiding technology for the first 30-60 minutes of waking.
  - Avoid smartphone use for 1-2 hours before sleep.
- People.
  - 20-60 minutes per day to think, reflect, ponder, and plan.
  - We all need time with people and time alone.
- **Food.**
  - You should be fasting from food for at least 18-24 hours on a weekly basis. When you fast, or "recover" from food, your body is given the opportunity to repair and rebuilt itself, rather than constantly digesting.
  - Increases levels of dopamine which elevates your happiness and confidence.
  - A 16-hour fast can reset your sleep cycle.
  - Being on an empty stomach helps you think and focus better. Hence, many people purposely skip breakfast so they can better focus on their creative work.
  - Fasting stabilizes your emotions. This happens by detaching from the emotional dependence on food.
  - Fasted state improves focus, memory, and ability to comprehend information.
- **Exercise.**
  - Shorter but more intensive exercise. Intensive activity followed by high quality rest and recovery.
  - Wherever you are, make sure you are there.
  - Sleep: increased memory, longer life, decreased inflammation, increased creativity, increased attention and focus, decreased fat and increased muscle mass, lower stress, decreased dependence on stimulants like caffeine, decreased risk of getting into accidents...

## Focus On Learning and Creating Rather Than Being Entertained and Distracted
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/focus-on-learning-and-creating-rather-than-being-entertained-and-distracted-e6573de1bc84)

- Most people are distracted while they're at work. They're distracted when they're with family and friends. They're distracted at the gym, on their commute, and even in the shower.
- Most people don't prioritize learning and creating. They don't care enough to invest in their personal development and growth.
- **Entertainment and distraction is the enemy of creation and learning. They will keep you in mediocrity. If you don't want to end up living a life of mediocrity, focus on learning and education.**
- The extent of the struggle determines the extent of the growth. Formal education makes a living, but self-education makes a fortune.
- Most people will continue to go through life "in quiet desperation", with their songs left unsung. Others dictate their income, their happiness, and their fulfillment.

### We Attract Into Our Lives What We Are

- **Any woman like that wouldn't want to have anything to do with someone like him!**
- You must become a far better version of yourself to achieve the enormous success you want.
- If you want a million dollars, do you have the mindset of a millionaire? **Do you have the financial knowledge and self-discipline to own that kind of money?**
- Every day, millions of people attract mediocre opportunities, not realizing they are attracting who they are!
- If you constantly engage in mediocre, low-frequency activities with toxic individuals, you'll only receive similar opportunities. You'll never experience the type of success of the world's most extraordinary people, because success is something you attract by the person you become.
- Safety or freedom? You can't have both.
- We trade our genius and artistry for apparent stability.
- "The goal of life is not to relax on the beach, sipping mojitos all day. The purpose is to find something you love that adds value to the world." -Ben Foley
- Your days must consistently be spent on high quality activities.
- **Have I improved 1% on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health?**
- If you want to live an extraordinary life, you need to give up a normal one.
- **You can reasonably spend time with just about anyone. You can reasonably eat anything placed in front of you. You can reasonably justify activities and behaviors that are, frankly, mediocre.**
- You can't continue being with low-frequency, negative people. You can't keep eating crappy foods that slow you down. You can't do many of the things you used to do. **This is what extraordinary requires. Most people see the price and simply say "no thanks". But anything is possibly if you pay the price.**
- If your lifestyle does not add to your healing, it will subtract from it.

## How to Become the Best in the World at What You Do
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-become-the-best-in-the-world-at-what-you-do-7d3e918780dd)

- Getting to Ramen profitable: practice and putting yourself out there. Quantity became quality. And then they put something out that people loved.
-  Coaching/education. Mentors that have changed how I write. Virtual online course. **You'll know when you're ready for the next level, because you'll make the proper investments in the teachers to help you get there.** Your level of commitment can directly be measured by how invested you are.
- Create your own rules. Restructure the game to automate your success.
- Consistency. It is the most fundamental virtue to becoming the person you want to be. Anyone can sprint, but everything meaningful in life is a marathon--meant to test your commitment and will.
- Learn from people who have actually been there, as opposed to sideline spectators. Never take advice from someone you wouldn't want to switch places with.
- Being holistic about your art.
  - Journalling: to capture all the work your subconscious has been doing while you were sleeping.
  - Or get to the project you were working on.
  - “Pain and other chronic symptoms are physical manifestations of unresolved internal conflict. Symptoms surface as the instinctual mechanism for self-survival. They are messages from the inner self wanting to be heard, but ego takes center-stage, and hides the truth within the shadows of the unconscious mind: which is the body.”
- Pre-performance routine to get you into the zone.
- Cycling is a sport notorious for the amount of suffering required. As Tyler Hamilton has said, “I discovered when I went all out, when I put 100 percent of my energy into some intense, impossible task — when my heart was jack-hammering, when lactic acid was sizzling through my muscles — that’s when I felt good, normal, balanced.”
- Cyclists often refer to “the pain cave,” which is a mental place they go deeper and deeper into as they’re competing. “I went deeper than I thought I would.” “I was at the limit.” “I was totally pinned.” You often hear phrases like these in interviews after a cycling race.
- “Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them.” — Josh Waitzkin
- When you begin feeling uncomfortable, that’s when you start feeling good. That’s when you’re growing. No pain no gain. That’s your happy place. That’s where most people stop. But not you.
- Do it because of love.

## How to Consistently Act From Your Deepest “Why” and Optimize Your Time
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-make-the-best-possible-use-of-your-time-335f15ecbefd)

- It is the norm to waste large portions of one’s time.
- Most people have very low standards for how they use their time.
- They don’t have clarity about where they should direct their attention.
- They haven’t created conditions to get clear on a daily basis.
- They don’t believe they deserve to spend their time on ONLY those things which fascinate, challenge, and motivate them.
- They haven’t discovered nor clarified their deepest held motivations, both for specific goals and for their life in general.
- They act and operate from their base-level reasons, which aren’t inspiring.
- Hence, most people’s time is spent either on stuff that literally irritates them, or at best, is merely “okay.”

### Your Life Is A Reflection Of What You Believe You Deserve

- Subconsciously, you believe you are "unworthy" of anything beyond what you currently have. Unworthy to have more, to contribute more, to experience more, to connect deeper.
- What if you decided to eat ONLY healthy foods?
- You raise the bar on what you believe you're worth.
- You raise the standards for: the type of person you want to be, the quality of work you want to do, the types of people you want to be around, the way you spend your time, and the lifestyle you have.
- Elevating your sense of what you deserve isn't about entitlement. It's about growth. At the deepest level, it's about giving and gratitude, the hallmarks of abundance.

### Seeing The Forest For The Trees

- The worm's-eye view: day-to-day routine for focus.
- the bird's eye view: the direction you're headed, and why.
- Because most people lack clarity, they aren't even sawing the right tree. Because people have low standards for themselves, they're fine spending large portions of time doing work that isn't making an impact. They prefer not getting stuff done.
- Sacred place to do the activities that will elevate you for the day: in his case, the car.

### Why do you want this?

- Clarity leads to motivation. Operating from your deepest conviction creates authentic and optimal performance.
- What about `___` is important to me?
  - Working from home: because I am as effective working from home as I am from the office.
  - Flexible schedule: because I do my best work in the deep evening.

## If You Don’t Believe In Setting Goals, It’s Because You Don’t Know How To Do It
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/if-you-dont-believe-in-setting-goals-it-s-because-you-don-t-know-how-to-do-it-96e7dbacca6d)

- Faith: having a belief or hope in something that you can't see or something that doesn't currently exist.
- People with a fixed mindset really have a really, really hard time learning. Why learn if you don't believe you can actually learn and evolve?
- There is a dominant learning style. You don't have strengths or weaknesses per se, but you have positive or negative learning habits.
- If you look at yourself in the mirror and believe in that person, then you are empowered. If you believe you can learn anything, you can. Are some things going to be harder to learn than others for you? Of course, but not because of fixed strengths and weaknesses, but because of atrophied or underdeveloped learning muscles, sabotaging beliefs, and bad habits.
- When you believe in yourself, you love the person looking back at you in the mirror.
- "My hero is me in 10 years."
- What you need to achieve any goal:
  - Clear goal, the more specific the better.
  - You need to actually want that goal.
  - You need to believe you can actually achieve your goal.
  - 100% commitment to your goal. Until you become 100% committed to your goal, there's hesitancy. If you're hesitating, you're ineffective. You're not completely absorbed. You're not reflecting, acting, analyzing, deciding, and thinking about all the ways you can accomplish your goal.

## Work On Yourself, Not On Your Job
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/want-to-become-the-best-at-what-you-do-read-this-10b6a79feda9)

- Your work is a reflection of you. If you're not getting the results you're looking for, stop looking for better strategies. Are you currently the person who would attract the level of success you seek?
- A significant of your energy should be devoted to your job, rest, and self-improvement.
- Putting yourself in situations others can only dream of: you have to put yourself in demanding situations--situations that humble and scare you. How to do this? Initiate. Don't wait for life to come to you. Don't wait for the next opportunity. Improve your current situation or job by providing actual value. Pitch ideas. Ask questions. Try and fail. Take on roles that require greater responsibility.
- "Leadership" - you just need to assume that role. Do this enough, and continuously pitch yourself and your ideas, and you'll create opportunities. You can then maximize those opportunities and more will come.
- Don't copy other people, make them copy you.
- Stay in love with the process.
  - The process or the work itself is all there is. Results come and go. And it's never been about the results. Success is inevitable.
  - **Success comes easy because it's the last thing on your mind. You already know it's going to happen.**
  - The work itself, and becoming better and better at it, is what drives you. It almost doesn't matter what you're doing. It's why you're doing it that matters.
  - When you are in love with the process, you seek feedback, mentoring, and coaching--even when you're at the top of your game.
  - You surround yourself with people who aren't afraid to tell you the truth. You avoid people who suck-up and only tell you what they think you want to hear.
  - Self-transcendence comes from collaborating with others who are driven by a greater and grander vision. When the whole becomes fundamentally different than the sum of its parts. When the work is the reward.
- Why are we doing this again?
  - Do not break your personal rules "just this once". In our minds, we can justify these small choices. None of those things, when they first happen, feels like a life-changing decision, but they roll up into a much bigger picture.

## Tell Me What You Did Today, And I'll Tell You Who You Are

- When you don't act in accordance with your values and goals, you're internally conflicted. You know you should be doing something: working on your project, being present with your loved ones, eating healthy, and you knowingly act in contradictory ways.
- Being internally-conflicted: checking Facebook/Twitter, eating bad, and going days without writing. Perfection shouldn't be the objective. However, consistency and implementation of our values and goals creates substantial momentum and results.
- "We live our lives in 24 hour periods: on the things that we did today, did we act like the person we wish to become?"
- Ideal day thing?
  - 7-8 hours of deep and healthy sleep.
  - Less than 300 calories of junk food, one meal each day eaten with wife and kids.
  - 30-60 minutes of exercise.
  - 15-30 minutes of prayer/meditation.
  - 3-5 hours of undistracted writing (no email).
  - 2+ undistracted hours with my kids.
  - 1+ undistracted hours one-on-one with my wife.
- Motivation and self-regulation theory.
  - If you're lacking motivation, there's a problem with your goals. Wrong goals, not specific enough, or the timeline isn't definitive enough.
- Self-regulation:
  - Self-monitoring: how well we are currently performing.
  - Self-evaluation: how well we are performing compared to our goals.
  - Self-reaction: determines how we think and feel comparative to our goals.
- When I get distracted, I pull out my journal and write my goals. This reignites my motivation and serves as my course-correction.
- You can't just want to succeed. You have to plan and prepare for the worst.
- You will get derailed often. You need to prepare for those moments you're not motivated. You do this by creating triggers that automatically reignite your motivation.
- How you spend each day is a clear indicator of who you are and who you will become. It's not enough to simply want a better future. You need to know what that future looks like, and start living that way today.

## How To Tell If Someone Is Truly Smart Or Just Average
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2)

- Musk: sees people as computers, and he sees his brain software as the most important product he owns--and since there aren't any companies out there designing brain software, he designed his own, tests it every day, and makes constant updates.
- Ray Dalio: record everyone and allow anyone to rate any other employee in real time. This data is then added to profiles that each employee can see and is subsequently fed into an artificial intelligence system.
- Charles Munger: cognitive bias checklist before making investment decisions to ensure he properly applies the correct mental models.
- Warren Buffett : decision trees.
- Charlie Munger: mental models.
- Bezos/Zuckerberg: experimentation engine.
- When I consider new business ideas, instead of just imagining how great they're going to be, I spend just as much time envisioning what could go wrong--another Munger hack. No need to remind myself to think this way anymore.
- Mental models:
  - For great thinkers, using mental models is conscious and proactive.
  - Musk: It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree, make sure you understand the fundamental principles before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang onto.
  - 20% of inputs lead to 80% of outputs.
- Tools:
  - The difference between us and people from 30K years ago. Only 30% of the population could read and write before the printing press was invented in 1440.
  - People who are able to model how this more complex reality works will be far more successful at navigating it.
  - People who are able to model how a complex business works in their minds are more likely to be successful business leaders, because they must understand finance, HR, product dev, marketing/sales, interacting with the mental models of their stakeholders.
  - When building a house, you need: electrical, plumbing, design, materials, pricing, to make a beautiful building.
- Mental model collectors:
  - Many of the world's problems result from people overgeneralizing from simplistic models just like our hypothetical one-size-fits-all "dog".
    - Black/white thinking: you're a good or a bad person.
    - Us/them thinking: people that aren't like you are your enemy.
    - Stereotypes.
  - Great thinkers: grandmasters have memorized no less than 50,000 chunks of increasing complexity including openings, closings, patterns.

- Expert generalist: "Someone who has the ability and curiosity to master and collect expertise in many different disciplines, industries, skills, capabilities, countries, topics."
- Expert generalists:
  - See the world more accurately and make better predictions of the future.
  - Have more breakthrough ideas.
- Two-Track analysis means considering:
  - How people act if they behaved rationally, according to their true best interests.
  - How they would succumb to the pull of a number of irrational psychological biases that seem to be "programmed" into the human brain.

## 5-Hour Rule: If you’re not spending 5 hours per week learning, you’re being irresponsible

- Automated vehicle fleets will eliminate one of our biggest purchases: a car. Virtual reality will make expensive experiences, such as going to a concert or playing golf, instantly available at much lower cost.
- Education and health care costs have risen but they will lower costs at some point when we get exclusive online, training for in-demand, high-paying skills, or having employers who recruit students subsidize the cost of tuition.
- At-risk people: those with no skills. They risk remaining stuck on the bottom rung of global competition, and they risk losing their jobs to automation.
- **There are no lack of jobs. There is a lack of skilled workers for those jobs.**
- Knowledge is the new money.

### Essential Skills

- Identify valuable knowledge at the right time.
- Learn and master that knowledge quickly.
- Communicate the value of your skills to others. Convincing others is a "multiplier skill."
- Convert knowledge into money and results.
- Learn how to financially invest in learning to get the highest return: we need the right portfolio of books, courses, degrees to help us achieve our goals within our budget.
- Learning how to learn.

## 40 Ways to Live a Full Life By Age 30

- **Do ridiculous things.** Getting a dog.
- **What will teach me the most?**
- **Quit dicking around.** 30 years, 1 year is so much time. Wake up every day and do a little more, dick around a little less.
- **The right time is right now.**
- **Get married, be in a long term relationship.**
- **Stay clear of charlatans and the toxic.** Unfollow, delete, purge. If a media site sucks, stop listening. If service at a restaurant sucks, don't go there. No need to be rude, but just don't do it.
- **Keep a journal.** This is to force you to think about what you're doing right now.
- **Hell yes or hell no is too simple.**
- **Live in a city, but not for too long.**
- **The quiet moments are the best.** It's in the quiet, still moments that we feel what matters in life. Standing on the shore of a lake, looking out over a canyon.
- **Have a philosophy.** Don't just wing things. Live by something.
- **Study real philosophy too.**
- **Exercise.**
- **Don't compare yourself to other people.** Who cares if they were first?
- **Sooner is not better.** Accomplishments don't change who you are. Where did numbers for age goals come from?
- **Meditate on your mortality.**
- **Don't live like every day is your last.** Live like it's the last day before a deployment: you'll handle your business, you'll spend time with your loved ones.
- **Travel with purpose.** You go to other places to learn about things, and what did you learn there, that you couldn't have gotten from some other source? What did you really do?
- **Be prematurely old.** I think it's better to have your shit together. Young people are stupid, old people are wise.
- **The law of diminishing returns.** Be willing to call things when the diminishing returns set in, it's how you move on when others are stuck.
- **Study the lives of the greats.**
- **Don't waste time being offended.** How much precious energy is spilled fighting online?
- **Buy a house.** It's something you want to get back to.
- **Work a lot.** Yeah, you won't be happy on your deathbed, but relative to what? Playing video games, going to restaurants, or chasing girls/boys? If you think what you do contributes to the world, then you should feel content and accomplished.
- **Don't be a hater.** What's the sense?
- **You can do no whatever you want.** No need to conform to needless constraints.

[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/23-smart-ways-to-increase-your-confidence-productivity-and-income-c21b42979893)

- **Deal with 5 minutes of pain.** Waking up only really feels terrible for 5 minutes, if you immediately get out of bed and do something.
  - The longer you hesitate to do something, the less likely you are likely to do it.
  - You know you are lying to yourself. If you do things that you say you are going to do, then that is a cause, not an effect. You gain confidence by doing what you say you're going to do.
  - You want to make decisions when you are in a good mental state. You want to start off your day in a good mental state.
  - This usually only lasts 5 minutes. Change environments as quickly as possible.
  - Sometimes, improvements are about changing the first 5 minutes of your day, or just having 30 days to build a habit.
- **Start your day with your #1 priority.**
- **Face your resistance/do what you're avoiding.**
  - When you get yourself to work on what's the most important for you, you can feel a surge of energy toward the other important stuff in your life.
- **Embrace multiple learning styles.**
  - Everyone has a dominant learning style, and we also have backup learning styles we rely on when we're in a difficult situation.
  - When you engage in an activity that you resist, you activate areas of your brain and emotions that you've suppressed.
  - You make new connections in your brain, and confidence in yourself by watching yourself do something difficult.
  - Growth mindset over fixed mindset.
- **How you do anything is how you do everything.**
  - You can't eat a chocolate cake and want to be slim.
- **Know and strategically define your why.**
  - "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any why."
  - Clarity leads to motivation, operating from conviction creates authentic and optimal performance.
  - What about so-and-so is important to me?
  - What about working from home is important to me? What about having a flexible schedule is important to me? Keep on asking why, why, why.
- **Be a giver, not a matcher or a taker.**
- **Only engage in transformational relationships, because transactional ones will end soon anyways.**
- **Don't overvalue what you contribute to your relationships while undervaluing what others contribute.** Don't keep score in your relationships.
- **Work with craftsmen, not salesmen.**
  - People who have high standards for their work.
  - Those who lack details in their work lack important details in the design of the other areas of their lives.
  - Craftsmen and professionals. Their priority is doing brilliant work, but they aren't starving artists. They understand the business side as well.
- **Elevate your sense for what you deserve in your life.**
  - There is an ocean of abundance, and one can tap into it with a teaspoon, a bucket, or a tractor trailer. The ocean doesn't care.
  - **Your life is a reflection of what you believe you deserve.** Your sense of what you deserve grows as you have a greater desire to help other people. You end up needing to use your time better, because you have important work to do.
  - Expectancy theory:
    - How bad you want something, how much you believe you can actually have, or do what you want, and your belief that the means by which you seek your goal will actually bring about the desired result.
    - Our eyes only see and our ears only hear what our brain is looking for.
    - Developing skills becomes an upward cycle of expectancy: you KNOW you can do more, you've watched yourself grow and transform, and you have higher and higher standards for yourself.
- **Elevate your sense for what you can contribute, because if you're willing to work and learn, you can do masterful things.**
  - Mastery comes from embracing difficult emotions. You'll face difficult emotions, because in order to gain true master, you must understand all sides of something.
  - Integrating, understanding, all of these require embracing all of the learning styles, breaking emotional blocks, expanding your sense for what you can do.
  - The more education a person gets, the more empathetic they can become. There is no power in ignorance.
- **Decide what kind of life you want, then figure out how to get it.**
  - Instead of "living within your means", why not proactively decide what you want, and then figure out how to get it.
  - On money: if you can have nice things, and not fear having them taken away, then it's a good thing. Because money is a really valuable tool.
  - Rather than fitting your dreams into your current lifestyle, fit your lifestyle around your dreams.
- **Serve and give as much as you can.**
  - Giving: you want to do this because you genuinely want to help other people, and you want to have a clear conscience.
  - You give because you must. You give of yourself, and organize your life to give so you can have a clear consciousness of how you're living your life.
- **Automate your income as quickly as possible to free up time.**
  - Courage: if you want to work in an environment where you are compensated based on your performance (business owner or employee paid on an incentive basis).
- **Give 10x value of what you say you will, aka blow people's minds..**
  - Passive income: you give way more than what people pay for. You focus on value, not price. When you focus on value, you can actually charge very large sums of money, because you know people will get at least 10x the value of what they paid for.
  - When you're a giver, you MUST give more value than people pay. You do it because you find joy in doing your very best work, you do it because you value the fact that people came to you.
- **Give away most of your work for free.**
  - Give away a lot of things for free. Your free stuff should also be valuable that it makes people want to come back for more.
- **Make more stuff, but only really good stuff.**
  - Ship often. Ship lousy stuff, but ship. Ship constantly.
  - Self-perception is the product of choices and environments.
  - If you want more creativity, then you simply need to do more creative work. You battle the resistance and get to work. Then, creativity becomes non-stop.
- **Become the best in the world at what you do.**
  - What is it you actually do?
  - Who are the people you help? What is the problem you're trying to solve for those people/ Don't define your audience or ideal customer by their demographics. Instead, define your audience by the problems they have.
  - How can you help this person? How can you help them so much that you become a hero to them?  How can you give so much to these people that you can change their lives for the better?
- **Invest heavily in yourself.**
  - You want to get in points of no return--it's like you are forced to move forward out of compulsion, but once you must go forward, you're not longer confused about what you need to do.
  - Psychological things to make sure you move forward:
    - You don't want to look like an idiot.
    - You want to justify your investment.
    - You have to be consistent with the behaviors you've performed.
    - You now have external conditions that will eventuate in a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- **Become a speaker and teach others what you've learned.**
  - Publicity, story, going in front of the world to share the message. You can manipulate human behavior, or you can inspire it.
  - People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.
- **Learn in public, even when you're scared.**
  - Musicians, boxers, lion tamers all practice in public. There is a huge difference between abstract, theoretical knowledge and knowledge developed and tested in the crucible of experience.
  - If you want to learn something fast, learn in public. Learn through raw experience. Learn through failure. Surround yourself with a support system of people who love helping you and investing in you.
- **Take a few minutes every night to mentally prepare yourself for the next day.**
  - The success of your morning begins the night before.
  - Just a few minutes of thoughtful and affirmative meditation will put your subconscious on a path toward achieving your goals.

## Why Even Ambitious People Rarely Become Successful
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/why-even-ambitious-people-rarely-become-successful-937e7cf26bfe)

- "Success" occurs internally, because it's based on emotion. At its most basic level, success is your relationship with yourself.
- Much better than ambition is commitment. You do what is required for the attainment of that thing. You'll stop wondering and start building.
- Ex: marriage is different from non-marriage.
- "Become a millionaire not for the million dollars, but for what it will make of you to achieve it." Jim Rohn
- The truth: you're always changing. Your brain and biology are highly malleable. Your worldview is continually integrating new information. Your brain literally creates new connections and is reshaped. The brain you will have in a year from now will literally be a different brain than the one you have now.
- Instead of making it like a willpower thing, you just do it. Don't give yourself outs.
- Better to be committed than to be ambitious. In terms of the "authentic" self, it's the enemy. It's the excuse you have for not evolving.
