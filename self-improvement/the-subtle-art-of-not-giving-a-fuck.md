- The strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of lack of fucks given.
- Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give a fuck about a rude gas attendant, we give a fuck if a show we liked was cancelled. We give a fuck when our coworkers don't bother asking us about our awesome weekend. We give a fuck when it's raining and we were supposed to go jogging in the morning.
- **Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, thatâ€™s when life fucks us.**
- Developing the ability to control and manage the fucks you give is the essence of strength and integrity. We must craft and hone our lack of fuckery over the course of years and decades. Like a fine wine, our fucks must age into a fine vintage, only uncorked and given on the most special fucking occasions.

### Subtlety #1: Not Giving A Fuck Does Not Mean Being Indifferent; It Means Being Comfortable With Being Different

- There is nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. They're couch potatoes and internet trolls. **In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality, they actually give too many fucks.** They are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices, and there they make none. They hide in a grey emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitied, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life.
- Being completely indifferent: not lawyering up and going after an asshole who screwed my mom out of a large chunk of money.
- When people don't give a fuck, we don't mean that they don't care about anything, what we just mean is that these people don't care about adversity in the face of their goals, they don't care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble.
- The admirable thing is staring failure in the face and shoving your middle finger back at it. The people who don't give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. "Because they know it's right." They know it's more important than them and their own feelings and their own pride and their own needs. They say, "fuck it", not to everything in life, but they say it to everything unimportant in life. **They reserve their fucks for what truly fucking matters. Friends, family, purpose. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things, the important things, people give a fuck about them in return.**

### Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.

- A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people's business.
- The old lady who screams at the cashier for not having a coupon worth 30 cents doesn't have anything better to do with her days than to sit home cutting out coupons all morning. She's old and lonely. Her kids are dickheads and never visit. She hasn't had sex in over 30 years. So she snips coupons. That's all she's got.
- **If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you, chances are you don't have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. That's the real problem.**
- The question is simply, how we each choose to allot our fucks.

### Subtlety #3: We all have a limited number of fucks to give, pay attention to where and who you give them to.

- Most things have little lasting impact on our lives. Those people's opinions we cared about so much before have long been removed from our lives. We realize how little people pay attention to the superficial details about us and we focus on doing things more for ourselves rather than for others.
- **Maturity: We becoming more selective with the fucks we're willing to give. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what's truly fuckworthy.**
- We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks only for the most truly fuckworthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing.
- When we are old, our ability to give a fuck has receded to the point of non-existence. Mundane things: where to eat lunch, doctor's appointments, 30-cent discounts, driving without drifting to sleep.
- **Then one day, on our deathbed, we're hopefully surrounded by the people who gave the majority of our fucks to throughout our life, and those few who still give a fuck about us, with a silent gasp we will gently let our last fuck go.**
