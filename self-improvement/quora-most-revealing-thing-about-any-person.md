# What is the single most revealing thing about any person?

"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power." - Abraham Lincoln

Watch how they treat people from whom they have nothing to gain. Lots of people are nice to the boss -  they don't want to get fired. Nice to the spouse - they don't want a divorce or maybe they want to sleep in the same bed at night or something. Even nice to people who work for them - because employees who are treated better tend to work better. But watch how a person treats people from whom they need nothing. That will tell you what they are really like.

"You can tell the greatness of a man by what makes him angry." - Abraham Lincoln

There is popular belief that 'true colours' of a person are revealed under situations of stress and pressure and how they behave therein. However I am inclined to disagree. Stress and pressure make base survival instincts kick in – and the result is not pretty. Different people have different coping mechanisms; and though some people may deal with bad situations more gracefully than others I don't think that should be the yardstick of measuring anyone.

People might sulk, withdraw, scream, cry or maintain nonchalance – but I believe all that is momentary and in the situational context. It does not mean that those people are not nice. On the other hand, the people who are able to deal with pressure situations too well, are either very experienced in this regard or maybe apathetic or unemotional in general. I am sure all great leaders show this trait. They consciously learn it because they can't be losing their heads as this would demoralize their teams. People who lead armies into war are especially trained in maintaining calm in tough situations.

I think the true nature of a person is revealed in life-as-usual circumstances when a person is not on an atypical emotional curve. These times make up for statistical majority in an average human's life, and hence should be taken as the background when assessing the personality. How do you behave at the dinner table every evening? How do you spend your Sunday afternoons? How often do you meet and talk to friends and family? What do you usually talk about? How do you feel on your commute to work and back? Do you make way for someone who is in a rush? Are you a natural critique or someone who compliments easily?

Out of all these, I feel a good insight to a person can be had by knowing what they do with their free time. It's very telling what a person chooses to do with time that is truly theirs.

You don't know who someone is until you see them under pressure. It is when we are under pressure that our true colors come out, when the ego's ass is put to the fire and we become the gateway between our survival self and doing what is humane and expressing integrity. If you think about it, it is really easy to be a nice person when there is no pressure in your life. It is easy to give money to those in need when you have it in your wallet. It is easy to smile when you're already laughing. It is easy to dance when you are in love with someone or with life itself. You don't mind donating money or doing extra favors when you have the time. Even arguing is OK when you are feeling fine otherwise.

A man is known by the company he avoids.

How the person manages his/her boredom. Some start bullying their loved ones for fun. Stealing, pranking, vandalizing or even terrorizing one's  own society also happen. On the other hand, other people instead decide to invent, create, nurture, volunteer, or learn something just for the sake of knowledge. In boredom, one could either create or destroy to feel better.

"When the character of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends." Apart from face to face interaction (to understand by their body language and eyes) this is an extremely revealing point about someone. People can hide very well their true character but they cannot escape the semiotics of their social circle. In both my personal and business life this has been one rule that even though I have tried to ignore (due to my own biases), has come true time and time again.

We can't feel what other people feel. We can only guess, and often, we do so by comparing the way they act and the way we would act if we would feel a certain way.
