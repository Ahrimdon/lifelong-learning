[Reference](http://www.becomingasuperhuman.com/30-secrets-adulthood-life-taught-far/)

- "Secrets of Adulthood"--a powerful and simple lesson that can only be learned by growing up and maturing.
- "What you do EVERY DAY matters more than what you do ONCE IN A WHILE."
- "Working is one of the most dangerous forms of procrastination."
- "We're more like other people than we suppose, and less like other people than we suppose".
- "The more we accept ourselves, and what's right for us, the more other people accept us."


- YOU choose how the course of your life will go, including which components to leave in and which components to take out.
- Happiness is a choice and a method of travel, not a destination or an outcome.
- Framing is everything. What actually happens is far less important than how you choose to view it. "Nothing is either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."
- Those we love are powerful mirrors, they shine a light on your shortcomings and strengths, and challenge you to be better.
- You cannot appreciate something in another unless you see it in yourself. **Conversely, you cannot loathe something in another unless you see it in yourself.**
- Everyone is responsible for their own emotions. This means that not only are you responsible for the way you are presently feeling, but also that nobody else "makes" you feel anything. **Others do what they do; only you choose how it will.**
- You will worry much less what others think about you when you realize how rarely they do.
- Never every encourage people who bring you down to stick around. Being in your life is a privilege, not a right.
- You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.
- Money cannot buy happiness, but there are few if any problems that it can't solve, if applied intelligently.
- You can only help people who help themselves, and there are more people who need your help than there is time to offer them. Invest your efforts deliberately where they ill create the most impact.
- Smile. It does you and everyone around you a world of good.
- Pay attention to people's names, remember them, and use them.
- Listening is the most important interpersonal skill there is.
- Depression is the act of living in the past; anxiety is living in the future. All happiness and joy come from mindfulness: the act of living in the present moment.
- Acceptance, alongside presence, is the key to living completely free of sorrow. **All discomfort and anguish in life comes from the inability to gracefully accept your present circumstances.**
- People, things, and events naturally enter and exit our lives. "People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime."
- There is no such thing as an objective reality. **Only the subjective realities of each individual person.** No one person's reality is any more real or accurate than yours. This is especially important for creating self-confidence.
- A leader is the person who's reality is embraced by others as the dominant one. **The difference between a leader and a tyrant is the extent to which he or she allows that reality to be collectively and collaboratively shaped.**
- Everyone has been psychologically damaged by their parents.
- Most if not all bad moods can be resolved by either exercise, sleep, music, friends, or family.
- In all reality, we are fundamentally alone in our experience on this planet. **Nobody can ever truly understand what we are seeing, thinking, or feeling as we do.** This is the experience that unites us. Everyone you meet is going through something you have no way of understanding.
- If you pay close enough attention, you can manifest what you desire.
- The more you try to shape the way others perceive you, the worse that perception will be. Confidence, charm, and charisma come from a unique combination of kindness, being vulnerable enough to trust that others will think highly of you, and a lack of concern for whether or not they actually will.
- Love and affection are not finite resources.
- The real golden rule is to treat others as THEY wish to be treated.
- **Lying is an egregious offence not only because it is an attempt to obstruct reality (there's not such thing as reality). Rather, all lies are an attempt to willfully and knowingly manipulate another person's reality to be different from one's own. For whatever end it is employed, lying exists to persuade another human being into seeing the world in a way that we ourselves do not. For this reason, it is as divisive as it is burdensome, AND IT IS TO BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.**
