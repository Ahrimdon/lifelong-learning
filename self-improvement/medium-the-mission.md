## Surround Yourself with People Who Hold You to a Higher Standard than You Hold Yourself
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/surround-yourself-with-people-who-hold-you-to-a-higher-standard-than-you-hold-yourself-96f12c186375)

- People select their friends based on proximity more than anything else.
- In a college classroom, you do not make friends exactly with those who share similar interests, but those who you literally sit next to.
- A person's economic mobility is highly determined by the county they live in.
- Who are the people in nearest proximity to you? How did they become your peer group? Was it on purpose or based on convenience? Do these people hold you to a high standard? Or do they hold you to an even lower standard than you hold yourself?
- Most people are willing to tolerate unhealthy relationships, poor finances, and jobs they hate. If not so, those things wouldn't be in their lives.
- But if your environment radically contradicts the goals you're trying to pursue, your life will always be an uphill battle.
- Ex: buying a new car, after getting it and posting videos of the car, he got 2000 friend requests, higher sales of his real estate education products, he was seen as "credible". Driving around in the coolest car made him feel awesome.
- *Precognition: that you can predict your own psychological/emotional state by targeting biological or environmental stimuli.*
  - The environment created amazing feelings.
  - He was seeing the fruits of his labors.
  - He was consciously generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in real-tie. He created an environment that was now creating him.
  - These fruits added even more confidence, creating a continuous confidence building feedback loop.
- *Confidence does not come from owning a Tesla. But the external and the internal play off each other. When you change your external environment, it alters your psychology, which then can loop back to continuing to enhance the environment in a virtuous upward cycle.*

### Surround Yourself with People Who Transform You

- Hired Ryan Holiday to help me with the book, when I send him a draft, he shows how it could be 10x better, and he holds me to that standard.
- It's more that I don't know what I don't know. Working with Ryan has streamlined my understanding of what is possible and what it takes to create something powerful.
- *By investing in what you're doing, you'll experience the psychological shift needed to achieve your goals.* Once invested, your identity towards what you are doing changes. You've put yourself physically, not just emotionally, in a position where you must move forward. The role of leadership becomes natural and instinctive.
- Same with Richard Paul Evans. He holds himself to an insanely high standard.
- *Surrounding yourself with people who have higher standards than you is the fastest way to change. If you don't change your environment, and instead attempt to overcome your environment through willpower, you'll lose every time.*

- Same with romantic relationships. Do they help you more than you become more than you currently are? Do you help them?
- 20% of people are moving forward, 60% mimics, and 20% is moving backward.
- You've been around people who, simply by being around them, elevated your thinking and energy. Those are the kinds of people you need to surround yourself with. Those are the kinds of people you need to be like yourself, so that others are better simply by being around you.
- *The quality of your life and the quality of your work is determined by the standards you have for yourself, and the standards of those around you. If you're fine doing mediocre work, then those around you are as well.*

## I Quit Social Media For 30 Days and Here’s What I Learned
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/i-quit-social-media-for-30-days-and-heres-what-i-learned-930795e784ef)

- Aziz: "Whenever you check for a new post on Instagram or whenever you go on The New York Times to see if there's a new thing, it's not even about the content. It's just about seeing a new thing. You get addicted to that feeling. You're not going to be able to control yourself. So the only way to fight that is to take yourself out of the equation and remove all these things."
- *What have I lost from the last decade of my life in exchange for a whole bunch of probably obsessive checking of Facebook?*
- Facebook--for sharing big news, for information recall.
- Books--after quitting social media, you'll miss reading them.

## Why Most People Will Never Be Successful
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-never-be-successful-632bb24fa5c3)

- Your days must consistently be spent on high quality activities. The more successful you become--which is balancing the few essential things (spiritual, relational, financial, physical) in your life and removing everything else, the less you can justify low quality.
- As your vision for yourself expands, you realize you have to make certain adjustments. You need to cut-back on spending all of your money and time on crap and entertainment. You have to save more, and invest more in your education and your future.
- This isn't about perfection. It’s definitely not about being busy all the time.
- *How you do anything is how you do everything.* This only makes sense for people who have removed everything from their lives they hate. To actually live this principle: your daily and normal life can only be filled with those things you highly value.
- When your days are filled with only those core essentials that mean the world to you, you will dominate in "all" areas of your life. Because the only things in your life are the things you highly value.
- This is very hard.
- But to repeat Jim Rohn, "A lot of people don’t do well simply because they major in minor things." Said another way, most people are caught in the thick of thin things.

## Mediocrity is a Virus. Here’s How to Banish it from Your Life.
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/mediocrity-is-a-virus-heres-how-to-banish-it-from-your-life-52a618c93391)

- When you justify and allow even little things into your life which your intuition warns you against, you permit a virus to enter your life. It spreads to other areas.
- Going against your higher intuitive voice is a slippery-slope. You don’t realize day to day how out of whack things are really getting.
- "A private victory always precedes a public victory." — Stephen R. Covey
- "When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food." — James Allen
- If you want to improve your finances, you have to change your desires about money. You can’t continue to enjoy spending money on the crap you spend it on. You can’t continue to be content always being stressed about money.
- If you no longer desire mediocrity, you won’t be mediocre. Herein lies a subtle and disarming truth — everything you have in your life is what you want. If you wanted something different, you’d have something different. As James Allen wrote, your circumstances reveal you.
- If you really wanted to believe something different, you’d be actively seeking to learn, to alter, and to replace your current set of beliefs.
- You’d no longer justify your behavior. You’d be more open, honest, and authentic about where you’re at. Ironically, you’d also be more accepting of where you’re at. Acceptance is the first step to commitment.
- *No excuses. If you need to learn something new, you’ll learn it. If you need to behave differently, you will. If you need a new environment, your reshape your circumstances.*
- True learning always occurs in an experiential way. It’s never purely theoretical. And generally, it can only occur in specific types of contexts. Just like creativity rarely happens while sitting at your desk, deep and transformational learning will rarely happen within the confines of your cushy and comfortable routine.
- You'll be stunned by how low your personal standards have been. You’ll be shocked what you've been willing to tolerate.
- Own your value system: most people are too concerned about what other people think to be their true selves.
- Doing burpees randomly: HE WANTS TO DO BURPEES.
- Make a private decision followed by a public commitment of what you intend to do. Surround yourself with the right people who will keep you accountable.

## How To Deal With Uncomfortable Emotions And Reshape Your Identity
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-deal-with-uncomfortable-emotions-and-reshape-your-identity-34f878cf69fa)

- Pain, discomfort, shock, boredom, impostor syndrome, awkwardness, fear, being wrong, failing, ignorance, looking stupid: your avoidance of these feelings is stopping you from a life beyond your wildest imagination.
- *Wealth, optimal health, incredible relationships, and deep spiritual maturity are all available to you. But you have to pay the price to have these things. The primary obstacle in your way is how you feel about what you need to do to have these things.*
- Most people aren't willing to feel difficult emotions on a regular basis. However, if you’re willing to disregard how you feel in the moment, you’ll have access to a world of opportunity unavailable to 99% of the population.
- When you feel the fear and do it anyways, you get the satisfaction of living life on your terms. Instead of being a hostage to your emotions, you get to experience them more deeply.
- *Hilariously, once you break past the emotional blocks and just act, it’s never as bad as you think it will be.*
- Napoleon Hill said, "When your desires are strong enough, you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve." Similarly, Tim Grover has said, "When you crave the end result, the hard work becomes irrelevant."
- *When the why is strong enough, you'll be willing to do any how. The clearer and bigger the why, thee bolder the how.*
- Taking cold showers = great practice. Even after doing it for years, I still often experience a moment of resistance.
- "Wow, I'm really doing this." Your beliefs and identity will change. They'll follow your courageous behaviors.
- Better to live in an environment you created than something created for you.
- *If you want something different, you need to act different. It doesn't matter how you feel in the moment.*

## 30 Behaviors That Will Make You Unstoppable
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/30-behaviors-that-will-make-you-unstoppable-ae749e04443e)

- Don't think, know and act. "Every right decision I have ever made has come from my gut. Every wrong decision I've made was the result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself."
- Always be prepared so you have the freedom to act on instinct. With enhanced consciousness, time will slow down for you.
- Don't be motivated by money or by anything external.
- Never be satisfied. *It is not about the goal. It's about the climb to see how far you can push yourself.* Does this make you ungrateful? Absolutely not. You’re entirely humbled and grateful for everything in your life. Which is why you will never get complacent or lazy.
- Always be in control. Act based on instinct, not impulse. Just because you could doesn't mean you do. And when you do, it's because you want to, not because you have to.
- Be true to yourself. When something isn't right in your life, change it. Immediately.
- Never let off the pressure. *You never take the pressure off yourself.*
- Don't be afraid of the consequences of failure. Whatever man.
- Don't compete with others. Make them compete with you.
- Never stop learning. *Ordinary people seek entertainment. Extraordinary people seek education and learning.*
- Success isn't enough, it only increases the pressure.
- Don't get crushed by success. There is no destination.
- Completely own it when you screw up. No blame. No deception or illusion. Just the cold hard truth. When you mess up, you own it. And as the leader, you own it when your team fails. Only with extreme ownership can you have complete freedom and control.
- Let your work speak for itself. Deep work: rare, high value, AND NOT REPLICABLE. If anyone can do it, then it is shallow work.
- *Always work on your mental strength.* "Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them." — Josh Waitzkin
- Confidence is your greatest asset. Running a marathon is far more mental than physical.
- Surround yourself with people who remind you of the future, not the past.
- Let things go, but never forget. Forgiveness improves not only your emotional health, but also your physical health.
- Have clear goals. Either on behaviors or on the outcomes you're seeking. For most people, behaviorally-focused goals are the better and more motivating option. But when you crave the results so much that the work is irrelevant, your aim should be directed straight at the outcomes you want.
- Respond immediately--he who hesitates is lost.
- Choose simplicity over complication. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
- Never be jealous or envious of someone else's accomplishments.
- Take the shot every time. If I fail more than you, I win.
- Don't get caught up in the results of your success. Always remain focused on what got you those results: the work.
- Think at 10x. *When you take your goal of earning 100K this year and change it to 1M, you're forced to operate at a different level.* Are you willing to go for 10x thinking? Are you willing to question your own thought processes and open yourself to believing an entirely different set of possibilities?
- Set goals that exceed your current capabilities. You need to aim beyond what you are capable of. You need to develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end. If your goals are logical, they won't force you to create luck. Being unstoppable means your goals challenge you to be someone more than you currently are.
