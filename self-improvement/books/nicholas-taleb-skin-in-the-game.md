# Skin in the Game - by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

- The knowledge we get by experience and the workings of time is vastly superior to that obtained through reasoning.
- You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can.
- Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice.
- Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk.
- Do your theories. Don’t tell people in the real world how to apply them. Let people select what they need.
- ***Things designed by people without skin in the game tend to grow in complication. There is no benefit for them to propose something simple: when you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication.***
- When there was risk on the line, suddenly a second brain in me manifested itself.
- What you learn from the intensity and the focus you had when under the influence of risk stays with you.
- Many kids would learn to love mathematics if they had some investment in it.
- I have no other definition of success than leading an honorable life.
- *Anything you do to optimize your work, cut some corners, or squeeze more “efficiency” out of it (and out of your life) will eventually make you dislike it.*
- Artisans have their soul in the game. Artisans do things for existential reasons first, financial and commercial ones later.
- ***Have no assistant. The mere presence of an assistant suspends your natural filtering. Its absence forces you to do only things you enjoy, and progressively steer your life that way.***
- *Many entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game in the sense that their aim is to either cash out by selling the company they helped create to someone else, or “go public” by issuing shares in the stock market.* The true value of the company, what it makes, and its long-term survival are of small relevance to them. This is a pure financing scheme and we will exclude this class of people from our “entrepreneur” risk-taker class (this form of entrepreneurship is the equivalent of bringing great-looking and marketable children into the world with the sole aim of selling them at age four). We can easily identify them by their ability to write a convincing business plan.
- Products or companies that bear the owner’s name convey very valuable messages. They are shouting that they have something to lose. Eponymy indicates both a commitment to the company and a confidence in the product.
- The thing you can learn from a professor is how to be a professor. The thing you can learn from a life coach or inspirational speaker is how to become a life coach or inspirational speaker.
- People want to have their soul in the game. Just to do things, because they feel it is part of their identity.
- I am: at the Fed level, libertarian at the state level, Republican at the local level, Democrat at the family and friends level, a socialist.
- All it takes is a few (motivated) activists for the banning of some books, or the blacklisting of some people.
- It is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. The same can apply to civil rights. It took seven or eight Poles to help one Jew. It took only one Pole, acting as an informer, to turn in a dozen Jews.
- Cursing today is a status symbol. The highest status, that of a free man, is usually indicated by voluntarily adopting the mores of the lowest class.
- Always do more than you talk. And precede talk with action. Action without talk supersedes talk without action.
- The way to make society more equal is by forcing the rich to be subjected to the risk of exiting from the 1 percent. Someone who is rich should never be certain to stay rich. No downside for some means no upside for the rest.
- *Use education in reverse: hire, conditional on an equal set of skills, the person with the least label-oriented education. It means that the person had to succeed in spite of the credentialization of his competitors and overcome more serious hurdles. In addition, people who didn't go to Harvard are easier to deal with in real life.*
- The rich start using “experts” and “consultants.” An entire industry meant to swindle you will swindle you: financial consultants, diet advisors, exercise experts, lifestyle engineers, sleeping councilors, breathing specialists, etc.
- Most people are happier in close quarters, in a real barrio-style neighborhood, where they can feel human warmth and company. But when they have big bucks they end up pressured to move into outsized, impersonal, and silent mansions, far away from neighbors.
- People need to be equal, at least for the purpose of the conversation, otherwise it fails. It has to be hierarchy-free and equal in contribution.
- When young people who “want to help mankind” come to me asking, “What should I do? I want to reduce poverty, save the world,” my suggestion is:
  1) Never engage in virtue signaling
  2) Never engage in rent-seeking
  3) You must start a business.
- Put yourself on the line, start a business. Yes, take risk, and if you get rich (which is optional), spend your money generously on others.
