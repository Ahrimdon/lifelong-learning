# Ask Gary Vee

# INTRODUCTION

- Feb 21, 2006: Wine Library TV. 999 episodes.
- David Rock for video, Steve Unwin/India Kieser for copy, Zak Moy for design.
- I like the Q&A part because that's when people realize that I'm not a clever speaker but an actual practitioner.
- Ask Gary Vee's appeal on millenials reaffirms my belief that there are gaping holes in the educ system. They need practical, tactical information, not just theory.
- Why a book?
  - Takes time to watch all episodes.

# CHAPTER 1 CLOUDS AND DIRT

- The clouds are the high-end philosophy and beliefs that are at the heart of everything I am personally and everything I do professionally.
- Bring value to the customer.
  - Provide 51 percent of the value in a relationship, whether it's with an employee, a client, or a stranger.
  - Always play the long game of lifetime value.
  - Smart work will never replace hard work; it only supplements it.
  - People are your most important commodity.
  - Patience matters.
  - Never be romantic about how you make your money.
  - Try to put yourself out of business daily.

- The dirt: hard work.
  - Communicating with my loved ones.
  - Showing up and staying present.
  - Apologizing when I mess up.
  - Making sure that this doesn't happen that much.
  - Knowing the craft.

- The middle?
  - I live people who are on a raw level, executing. They are engaging and experimenting and trying things that risk getting them ridiculed. They are people who are looking far into the future.
  - ***If you have pages and pages of notes, but no product, you've got nothing.*** If you can't tell me how you're going to build your product, you've got nothing. And if you're only thinking three years into the future, you've got a huge vulnerability.
  - Vagueness sucks. Lack of drive sucks. Half-assing things sucks. And so does the middle.

- Where do you see yourself in five years?
  - Five years ago, there was no Instagram, Snapchat, GoPro, Netflix as it is today.
  - I will check patterns, track them down, and adjust.

- What would you prioritize as a one-person business? Cash flow. No second. You need product, team, and service. Figure out your strength and drill deep with them. Your strongest skill is its DNA.
  - Bet on your strengths.

# CHAPTER 2 STARTING OUT

- 2 things that bring people value: entertainment and utility.
- On great business names: nothing to do with your name. Go with an abbreviation if you need to. If the product sucks, the name means nothing.
- What was the hardest thing about starting up VaynerMedia from scratch? There were a lot of possible things to do, and this is what I chose.

- I love my job but I want to do my own blog and my own hustle. But I'm crippled when it comes to executing.
  - Would you be so afraid if you knew no one was watching?
  - I don't think what scares people is not fear of failure, but fear of failing in front of someone who matters.
  - ***But if you want to be an entrepreneur—if that's what you really, really want—you cannot give a shit about what other people think of you. Not even your parents.***

- What's the best way to deal with someone who is negative about entrepreneurship? What if it's your mom?
  - The best way to solve this is to just execute and win.
  - Also, ask yourself: do you believe in you? IF yes, then no one else's opinion really matters. Prove them right or prove them wrong, either way, you're better off for trying.

- When trying to create a new media property (say, something at the intersection of food and tech, with no real precedents), how do you find and forge the right partnerships, that is, people with resources and access?
  - Ask first what I can do for them. Usually from following them on social media.
  - Spec work/services.

- How do I get the first ten customers for a creative service start-up?
  - Cold call. To get those first ten customers, you have to grind.
- Every industry has its market leaders—companies who have done good work in the past and have become the default solution for their client base. Your goal is to become one of those leaders.
- ***So first you have to get over your resentment of the competition and realize that you haven't done crap to establish your brand. The way you can overcome that, in my opinion, is to deliver great work and start creating word of mouth. It's just grinding and going through the process.***
- First client: grind. Biz dev, networking, advertising, putting out content. Pure execution.
- Finding a coder: meetup.com.
- Promoting an app: content, content, content. Then pound the community. Jabs and right hooks to build a brand.

- What are the biggest mistakes you see young entrepreneurs make?
  - You're building businesses that only work during best-case market scenarios.
  - A stock collapse will happen.
  - Build solid teams, good products, and excel at sales. Without sales, you've got nothing.

# CHAPTER 3 EDUCATION

- One course you can teach? Exploring the disconnect between school and the entrepreneurial world.
- On Twitter: tweet and engage. Medium = the platform that offers virality to people who have no audience.
- Don't be a student, be a practitioner.
- Casey on degrees: "In life you should only be doing two things ever: discovering your passion and then realizing it. If you know what you want and that trajectory doesn't necessitate a college education, then skip it."
  - If you suck at painting, then maybe you can try out graphic design.
