# Ask Gary Vee

# INTRODUCTION

- Feb 21, 2006: Wine Library TV. 999 episodes.
- David Rock for video, Steve Unwin/India Kieser for copy, Zak Moy for design.
- I like the Q&A part because that's when people realize that I'm not a clever speaker but an actual practitioner.
- Ask Gary Vee's appeal on millenials reaffirms my belief that there are gaping holes in the educ system. They need practical, tactical information, not just theory.
- Why a book?
  - Takes time to watch all episodes.

# CHAPTER 1 CLOUDS AND DIRT

- The clouds are the high-end philosophy and beliefs that are at the heart of everything I am personally and everything I do professionally.
- Bring value to the customer.
  - Provide 51 percent of the value in a relationship, whether it's with an employee, a client, or a stranger.
  - Always play the long game of lifetime value.
  - Smart work will never replace hard work; it only supplements it.
  - People are your most important commodity.
  - Patience matters.
  - Never be romantic about how you make your money.
  - Try to put yourself out of business daily.

- The dirt: hard work.
  - Communicating with my loved ones.
  - Showing up and staying present.
  - Apologizing when I mess up.
  - Making sure that this doesn't happen that much.
  - Knowing the craft.

- The middle?
  - I live people who are on a raw level, executing. They are engaging and experimenting and trying things that risk getting them ridiculed. They are people who are looking far into the future.
  - ***If you have pages and pages of notes, but no product, you've got nothing.*** If you can't tell me how you're going to build your product, you've got nothing. And if you're only thinking three years into the future, you've got a huge vulnerability.
  - Vagueness sucks. Lack of drive sucks. Half-assing things sucks. And so does the middle.

- Where do you see yourself in five years?
  - Five years ago, there was no Instagram, Snapchat, GoPro, Netflix as it is today.
  - I will check patterns, track them down, and adjust.

- What would you prioritize as a one-person business? Cash flow. No second. You need product, team, and service. Figure out your strength and drill deep with them. Your strongest skill is its DNA.
  - Bet on your strengths.

# CHAPTER 2 STARTING OUT

- 2 things that bring people value: entertainment and utility.
- On great business names: nothing to do with your name. Go with an abbreviation if you need to. If the product sucks, the name means nothing.
- What was the hardest thing about starting up VaynerMedia from scratch? There were a lot of possible things to do, and this is what I chose.

- I love my job but I want to do my own blog and my own hustle. But I'm crippled when it comes to executing.
  - Would you be so afraid if you knew no one was watching?
  - I don't think what scares people is not fear of failure, but fear of failing in front of someone who matters.
  - ***But if you want to be an entrepreneur—if that's what you really, really want—you cannot give a shit about what other people think of you. Not even your parents.***

- What's the best way to deal with someone who is negative about entrepreneurship? What if it's your mom?
  - The best way to solve this is to just execute and win.
  - Also, ask yourself: do you believe in you? IF yes, then no one else's opinion really matters. Prove them right or prove them wrong, either way, you're better off for trying.

- When trying to create a new media property (say, something at the intersection of food and tech, with no real precedents), how do you find and forge the right partnerships, that is, people with resources and access?
  - Ask first what I can do for them. Usually from following them on social media.
  - Spec work/services.

- How do I get the first ten customers for a creative service start-up?
  - Cold call. To get those first ten customers, you have to grind.
- Every industry has its market leaders—companies who have done good work in the past and have become the default solution for their client base. Your goal is to become one of those leaders.
- ***So first you have to get over your resentment of the competition and realize that you haven't done crap to establish your brand. The way you can overcome that, in my opinion, is to deliver great work and start creating word of mouth. It's just grinding and going through the process.***
- First client: grind. Biz dev, networking, advertising, putting out content. Pure execution.
- Finding a coder: meetup.com.
- Promoting an app: content, content, content. Then pound the community. Jabs and right hooks to build a brand.

- What are the biggest mistakes you see young entrepreneurs make?
  - You're building businesses that only work during best-case market scenarios.
  - A stock collapse will happen.
  - Build solid teams, good products, and excel at sales. Without sales, you've got nothing.

# CHAPTER 3 EDUCATION

- One course you can teach? Exploring the disconnect between school and the entrepreneurial world.
- On Twitter: tweet and engage. Medium = the platform that offers virality to people who have no audience.
- Don't be a student, be a practitioner.
- Casey on degrees: "In life you should only be doing two things ever: discovering your passion and then realizing it. If you know what you want and that trajectory doesn't necessitate a college education, then skip it."
  - If you suck at painting, then maybe you can try out graphic design.

# CHAPTER 4 FAMILY BUSINESS

- One of the best ways to go out of business is to make emotional decisions, to get romantic about how you make your money, or to let your emotions get in the way of the task at hand.
- If you and your family love each other more than you love the business, you will succeed.
- Whatever the kids do, I'll love them unconditionally. All we ask is that whatever they choose to do, they give it all their heart and do it to the best of their abilities.
- Success is not a game of absolutes. You can be in a relationship and have family obligations and have a business.
- AJ: Mature and self-aware and adds tremendous value to the company. When going into a business with a family member, be the bigger man or woman.
- Vayner: We have friends and family in both businesses. No one gets put in a power position unless they've earned it.

# CHAPTER 5 PARENTING

- Parents: let and encouraged him to do what he wants and what he was good at.
- How do you keep someone from being a spoiled, self-centered brat? When I did something wrong, she treated that as an extraordinary thing, too.
- Pumping everyone confidence makes for a more creative, risk-taking environment.
- Super-privileged background:
  - Did their parents spoil them or did they make them work for what they wanted?
  - Did they teach them the value of having money?
  - Did they talk to them about how money factors into our country's discussions about class, education, and politics, or how the goods we take for granted are considered luxuries somewhere else?

# CHAPTER 6 HUSTLE

- People almost never increase their natural talent, but they can transform themselves by increasing their hustle.
- If you're not born with it, you can get it.
- You have to spend more time doing whatever it is that takes you where you want to go. Do more than the competition. And do it every single day.
- ***I'm self-aware enough to know I have a lot of talent, but it's my work ethic—my hustle—that has been a substantial backbone to my success. I will outwork anyone. How about you? You can be a phenomenal content creator, but if you lack passion or a willingness to sweat there is someone else out there who is going to make more opportunities for herself and more money than you. Don't let that happen. Put down Clash of Clans. Binge-watch Game of Thrones or Walking Dead next year. And get to work.***


- ***Look at your level of hustle and evaluate it. Ask yourself, Am I working as hard as I could? Am I doing great work? If you work for yourself and the answer is no, think long and hard about the business you have started or the consulting work you're doing. Is it a good fit? Are you playing to your strengths? Would you be more motivated and feel more confident if you worked with a partner? If you're working for someone else, and you feel like you're not living up to your potential, please consider finding a new place to work. If you want to succeed, you've got to surround yourself with the right kind of people. Go where you are motivated to take risks. Be with people who allow you to make your best work. Your DNA matters, but make sure your circumstances are allowing you to win.***
- Now, once you have a product, there could be tons of things you could do to promote a local business—Facebook ads, tweets, geolocation, mobile ads, Google AdWords—the options are tremendous.
- Smaller companies: work more.
- E-commerce: Facebook ads. AdWords. Biz dev.
- For the first 8 years, 1998-2006, there is nothing about Gary Vaynerchuk.
  - I was working. I was learning, practicing, questioning, researching, and experimenting.
  - I was building the expertise and experience that would allow me to position myself as an authority, not just in the wine world but in the business world as well.
  - Today I can say I built two $50 million businesses in five-year periods, and showed a talent for investing in companies early and making a lot of money.
  - I can rattle off an educated answer to almost any question about wine or Internet business you can throw at me. You think I came by all that knowledge overnight? I got in the trenches and lived my business and did the work that allowed me to build the Gary Vaynerchuk brand. I created reasons for people to think I was worth paying attention to and even worth spending money on to hear me speak at events or read my books.

- How do you avoid procrastination so well?
  -  What some people might call procrastinating I call reprioritizing. I'm in constant audit mode adjusting to real life all the time.
  - Something might be super-important one day only to get demoted the next when I open my inbox in the morning.
  - Trying to keep track of what's most important and when can drive my assistant crazy.
- Mark my words, if you tell me you're hustling, I will go to your Instagram or Twitter account and take a look at your work.
  - I will click the posts and hit the profile where it says "view all with replies," and I'll study the engagement rates.
  - I love it when I see one engagement after another with just some retweets.

- The biggest excuse? If you are serious about reaching your dreams, nothing will get in the way. Never make excuses. Love taking the blame. Stop saying "but" and you'll be forced to move forward, and there will be nothing standing in your way anymore.

# CHAPTER 7 CONTENT AND CONTEXT

- ***People buy with their hearts, not their heads, and the way to every consumer's heart is through a good story.***
- What defines quality content nowadays?
  - It appeals to the heart.
  - It's shareable.
  - It's native to the platform on which it appears.
  - It breaks through the noise.
- Everyone will be a media company.
- Medium/LinkedIn: have a similar intellectual vibe and can share their audience.
- What's the best way to grow a following or community from nothing?
  - Put out quality content every day and engage around it. Without content you'll have nothing around which to build your community.
  - Focus on getting close to that daily goal as possible.
  - Buzzfeed: multiple times a day, Seth Godin: best effort once a day.
  - Give people something to look forward to.
- Should I post articles on my blog and just mention them on social, or post natively on sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Medium? Or both?
  - Medium: I can see how many people viewed it. Monetize the results later.
- Wine Library: I spend 30-90 minutes reading and engaging with the audience.
- Potential partners: be willing to work for free at first. D Rock>
- Recycling content: a team adapts pieces of content that can constantly be turned into articles, infographics, short movies.
- Content/opportunity? Have a time limit for the things you make. You can't let yourself get paralyzed by perfectionism.
- Content creates opportunity, and if you can't produce the content at the rate your audience wants it, your business won't survive.
- On producing relatively good content: I listen to my community. I don't need to watch other shows or pay attention to other thought leaders to know what people are struggling about. I listen to things.
- Pinterest: Visual. Infographics, photographs, behind-the-scene shots.
- Titles: Accept that you need to write attention-grabbing copy. If you can't, you're in trouble.
- On automating: don't automated human interaction.
  - Automated email: you can sign the company name or the team at your company name, but don't say it's from you.
  - You have to make your personal replies really personal.
  - People can game the automated stuff (bad user names).
  - It makes you look like an asshole. Just tell them if there is an automated tweet coming.
  - Automation robs you of the ability to create real context around your content.
- If you're introverted, just make good content and let your work speak for itself.
- Listen, engage, create content. Do searches and shit.

# CHAPTER 8 JABS AND RIGHT HOOKS

- Jab: the content you put out that entertains, distracts, attracts, informs, or otherwise engages and builds a relationship between you and your audience. It builds your brand, raises people's awareness of who you are and what you represent, and opens people up to receiving a right hook when the time is right.
- Right hook: the content you put out that brings in the sale. The one that offers the 10 percent off, or announces the new line, or merely says, "Buy my stuff."
- What's the best advice you can give salespeople in the social media/digital world age?
  - Make sure your jabs bring enough value first.
  - Ask Gary Vee show: It was because I knew that a lot of ents, managers, and marketers were still out there looking for guidance and inspiration.
- Just ask. Use Facebook ads because the segmentation is incredible. Use Twitter search to act as your bionic ears.
- Give when it's time to give. Don't hesitate to ask for a sale.
- As we go from concept to final product, how can we empower our readers to spread the word?
  - Make a good product. Write an amazing book, develop a life-changing workshop, or build a better grill. Make whatever it is worth more than the money you're asking for it.
  - Be up front about what you want from your consumer. Don't hedge your right hook. Ask for it. If you've been jabbing well with native content until that moment, your right hook should land squarely in the heart of the consumer and convert the sale.
- Instagram right hooks: the URL in the profile.
  - Put up a piece of creative. Drive people to your profile in the copy. Link out in your profile and convert your right hook.
- How do you make the transition from jabs to right hooks?
  - Attack the problem with a signature piece of content. A manifesto, if you will.
  - "My passion has been something I want to do full-time."
- Companies with no jabbing: Apple. They make themselves exclusive by not jabbing.
- Long written posts on Facebook: Positive responses.
- ***No matter who your audience is, you're always one great piece of content away from changing your life. Everyone you know started off as an unknown until they did the thing that made them known.***
- You have to be right! Things like "FB is going to buy Instagram."
- A good question to ask: "What do you think of my show?" and "What do you think of my service?"
- Book sales: I started selling my next book during the first episode of the show.
  - Social media to jab.
  - What sucks: bulk emails.

# CHAPTER 9 THE PLATFORMS

- Success of a social network:
  - Youth market.
  - Be useful. Instagram: made people better photographers.
- The upside of being an early mover in a new platform is greater than the downside of waiting there for months.
- Blogs?
  - If you're in business, you've got a blog.
  - If you have content in social networks, you're blogging.
- Instagram vs Twitter:
  - Instagram has a lot of the users' attention.
  - Lots of noise in Twitter. Easier to look at photos.
  - Not essays on the Instagram captions.
  - But some people like the long form on IG.
- Marketers ruin everything. People will try to sell on whatever platform has the public's attention.
- Listicles: People want their new fast, colorful, and pithy. So yeah.
- What are your thoughts on Facebook advertising on television?
  - As long as you can reach an audience there, why not?

# CHAPTER 10 FACEBOOK ADS

- The strength of Facebook: It can target to age, sex, occupation, behaviors and interests.
- Demographics and buying histories.
- On what people can talk about: Rogaine, Depends. Use the data mining capabilities.

# CHAPTER 11 INFLUENCER MARKETING

- Video: underpriced below its market value.
- Influencers can: create content and create meaningful distribution.
- Influencer marketing/product placement?
- The thing that makes influencer marketing different from other marketing channels:
  - ***Paying for both content and DISTRIBUTION on the same line item.***
- It doesn't matter how many people are on the list, what matters is how many of them open, click, and buy your setuff.
- Let the influencer do the thing.
- Keep on running tests.
- How to be an influencer?
  - Talent
  - Work

# CHAPTER 12 STOP WITH THE EXCUSES!

- Go from defense to offense. Instead of "I can't", it has to be "Why can't I?"
- How do I create interesting content for a boring product or a stale industry?
- There is no boring if you tell your story right.
- The problem isn't the content, it's the mindset.
- Think of how your business/brand/product touches people. Hardware store = not about the tools, but about people building their dream homes.
- I don't want to copy what everyone else is doing, I want to stand out. So I stick to what I'm really good at, and I search for inspiration where everyone else isn't looking.
  - Toy collecting/baseball cards: "People collect wine."
  - Silicon Valley/Hollywood: creating Wine Library TV.
  - Business skills = creating an agency that focuses on biz results, more than the creative.
  - SEO/email marketing/content marketing = figuring out how to create strategies fro the new social media platforms.
  - If you're launching a fitness app, pay attention to what's happening in the food industry, the rock climbing industry, even hip-hop or sports. Think completely left field.
  - The best way to stagnate is to pay attention to everyone else because they're doing the same crap over and over. And guess what? The same old crap sucks.
- Funeral industry?
  - When someone breaks new ground in any industry, they will likely be accused of disrespect.
- ***Innovation is what wakes up sleepy, gray-haired industries. When I started in the wine business, wine was serious and sophisticated, and its experts were sixty-year-old gentlemen, not twenty-five-year-old Jets fans from Jersey.*** So I came in and I innovated. I started a dot-com in 1996. I started a YouTube show less than a year after YouTube launched. I started posting content on Snapchat and Pinterest before almost any other entrepreneur knew what to do with them. When you get in early, you have the freedom to play and improvise and figure out what works best.

# CHAPTER 13 GRATITUDE

- What fuels me? Gratitude. I'm glad I was born in a communist country and got to move to this country, where capitalism is revered and appreciated.
- Figure out how to develop gratitude. You are entirely responsible for everything. It's a huge eye-opener when you realize that you are responsible not only for yourself and your family and loved ones, but for other people's, too.
- It's impossible to complain when you default to gratitude.
- I never take it for granted when people take minutes out of their ridiculously busy worlds to watch my show or read my blogs or books.
- Charities/NGOs: they sometimes just ask for things without even saying hello first. People focus on the organizations that have bothered to build a relationship with me, not the ones who approached with their hands out.
- ***For NGOs and charities to succeed in social media, they have to do what all the for-profit businesses out there are doing—hustling, listening, creating dialogue, solving problems, building relationships, and storytelling.***

# CHAPTER 14 LEADERSHIP

- ***My philosophy on leadership is very simple: Everything in business stems from the top, whether you're the boss of two people in a three-person team or the head of a Fortune 500 company.***
- Everything that happens in a company is 100 percent the CEO's fault. After all, the CEO is the person who puts people into a position to make good or bad decisions. It's no accident that when some companies change their CEO they go from winners to losers or vice versa. It may be the most important variable for success in running a business.
- *The only effective way to truly lead is to practice and model the behavior you want to see in others.* That's why I once drove across state lines in a blizzard during the height of the Christmas rush to deliver a single case of white zinfandel to a customer whose order had been delayed. I know my team is watching me. *I can't tell them to go the extra mile if I'm not willing to do it myself.* If the DNA of any business stems from the top, the top has to ensure that its values, beliefs, and attitudes trickle down to shape the culture and encourage a productive, innovative, creative, and even happy environment.

- What are the most important lessons your father taught you about building a business?
  - ***My dad is responsible for the single most important advice I've ever received: Your word is bond.***
  - He taught me that when you make a commitment, you stick to it. If I bought fifty cases of wine, I was in for those cases no matter what.
  - If the market changed or the wine received a poor rating, I was to stick with that purchase. You take it, you eat it, you drink it.
  - *Those lessons made me into the man I am today. They showed me that I could use my charisma for good, and that I didn't need to cut corners or treat people poorly to succeed. For this reason, I've been able to hold on to business relationships for decades. Being honorable always pays off in the long run, even if it occasionally makes you a little less money in the short term. The marathon truly has greater value than the sprint.*

- How do you change a firmly established culture into one that genuinely cares about the customer?
  - *Everything that happens at VaynerMedia is my fault. Because I empower everybody I work with to create the culture at my company, the responsibility to build that culture is entirely on me. If I fail, we fail, so I work my butt off to make sure I don't.*
- You can't just hack at the thing; you have to do it right. My point is, sometimes you have to get rid of the old, tired stuff at the top to give something better a chance to bloom. And the same can be said for old, tired ideas or old, tired ways of doing business.
- Obviously I'm not proposing murder, so how could you go about "killing" a company's leadership to give a new culture room to grow? You might try to express your concerns directly to the people in charge and pray they're open-minded enough to listen. You could try talking to influential people within the company who aren't part of the leadership team and hoping they'll take up the cause. You could do as much as you can within your small sphere, then work hard so that you rise up within the company and your sphere becomes bigger and your influence more broadly felt.
- What if you're working for a family business or a new CEO, and there's no hope for change? Get the hell out. Sorry, there really is no other solution.

- Complaining?
  - What's the value in it? I was lucky to learn this lesson very early on from my mother, who I swear has never complained a day in her life, and she's an immigrant who lost her mother at the age of five and fled from a communist country, so you know her life has not always been sunshine and rainbows.
  - Not that anyone's ever is. But that's my point. Problems happen. Life isn't fair or perfect. Complaining fixes nothing. Only taking action does.
- Positivity is a state of mind.

- If you could teach everyone in the world one thing you've learned, what would it be?
  - My dad taught me that word is bond, but as crucial as that lesson is, I think it's a lesson that was uniquely important to me because of my personality.
  - ***Here's the one universal rule I would try to teach everyone: Depth matters more than width. That is, the smallest meaningful, intentional act will mean much more than a huge one that lacks intent or substance.***
  - Sadly, a lot of the social media world is still going wide—gunning for more likes, shares, and right hooks, doing whatever they can to make their fan or follower numbers grow instead of paying attention to the quality of their engagement. We want the attention, but then we don't want to give it back. And no, offering a like in exchange for a like, or a share for a share, doesn't count. It's a crap move that takes no thought and has no substance.
  - This is my call to action: Go deep. Reach out, provide value, and be there.

- How do you stay constantly motivated?
  - One, I love what I do. I love the HR nightmares of a 500-plus organization, the headaches, the grind, the calls with an upset customer, all of it. It's easy to stay motivated when you know your day is filled with things that are getting you closer to your goals.
  - Two, I'm grateful every single day. I feel so lucky to have been born in the mid-1970s, during such a special moment in Soviet history, instead of the mid-nineteenth century or the 1940s, and to have been given the opportunity to come to this country. I'm grateful for my parents, my wife, and my kids. I made this bed; how can I complain? Gratitude is amazing fuel.

- How do you keep others motivated?
  - Motivating employees should be one of a leader's top priorities. You already know I believe in leading by example, not just when you're running meetings, but in your daily interactions, in the emails you send, even your posture.
  - I hope that the way I carry myself and live my life motivates people to work hard and do their best by others.
- What advice would you give someone transitioning to a leadership role?
  - My advice in this case would be to learn to rely on empathy and emotion as much as your executive skills so you can empower your team to become leaders themselves and take ownership of their work. That's a much harder thing to do than just ordering people around, but the end result is far more rewarding and productive.
  - That means sometimes you're going to have to take the hit if your team isn't performing the way you hoped it would. *You need to be the best human being you can be to earn their trust and respect. Back your team up and don't pass blame, and you will earn their loyalty and their best efforts.* And really, isn't that the best thing a leader could ask for?

- Do you prefer to be around people who are the same or different than you?
  - But I do value what other people have to say. A solid debate is as sexy as—and sometimes more so than—a mutual admiration society. For someone who talks as much as I do, which is constantly, I listen quite a bit.

- If you were to tragically die today, how well would VaynerMedia do long term without its CEO?
  - If the DNA of a company stems from the top, then it makes sense that it will stagger if something happens to a key player. My brother and cofounder, AJ, is ridiculously capable, but I'd assume if something were to happen to me he'd be pretty torn up.
  - He'd better be, anyway. And knowing him, it's possible he would wonder whether there was any point in continuing. So it wouldn't surprise me if it were other people in the team who insisted on keeping the business going. We've built an interesting culture, and I think in the end it would survive and eventually thrive again, especially once AJ was ready to take the helm if he chose to.

- Companies: primarily about HR and sales. Hiring and selling stuff. The level at which you will be able to perform will be capped by your level of talent, but anyone who's good at both is in a position to succeed at the helm of a company. Any company.

- I want to encourage people to do what I did and leave a very secure job to pursue their dream. But will my employee retention rate drop? Has yours dropped since you started building up your personal brand?
  - *The only way to build retention is to make it clear to your employees that you want them to be happy and live their dreams. That kind of support builds insane loyalty. My employees know without a doubt that I want to win, but not at their expense.* I am well aware that some of them have dreams that might take them away from this company, and me, and if that happens, they will have my blessing and my support.
  - In the meantime, however, I will try to bring them so much value over the long haul that they will have to think twice, maybe even three times, before deciding to leave.
  - I think it's sad when leaders and managers feel threatened or betrayed when they find out a valued employee is ready to move on. Our job as leaders is to empower our teams and root for them. Most of the time, if we do that right, we have a chance of building a relationship that can benefit us both whether we're working in the same company or not.

- How important is failure?
  - We learned that failure doesn't kill you, and that the earlier you do it, the easier it is to recover.
  - *If you fail and you can't get up again, that's not a good thing. But if you're made of the right stuff, failure will just compel you to get back up and try harder. Any failure from which you can recover is a learning opportunity that will only make you stronger.*
- Vayner's successes: announced only long after when the thing happened.
  - It's all because I love the climb so much. Many entrepreneurs are like that. We're so focused on the journey, by the time we've gotten to the top we're already thinking about the next hill.
  - I know this is a weakness and it's one I think is worth working on. It's up to me to shape our culture, and I want my company to be a place where we celebrate our wins as a team. It's important to stop and smell the roses, but sometimes you need to hand them out, too.

- Being nice is a choice, and how you choose to speak to people even when you're pressed for time will reveal who you really are.
  - It has nothing to do with technology or the generation gap.
  - The jerks, especially the ones with power, who are making people miserable at work today would have been making people miserable at work thirty years ago.
  - Money and fame doesn't change people, it just exposes them.
  - When you're being watched all the time, it's harder to hide your true nature.

# CHAPTER 15 MANAGEMENT

- From the very beginning, when AJ and I were just starting VaynerMedia, we made a few key decisions and set standards that we swore would be upheld no matter what.
  - We did this because we had seen too many companies become breeding grounds for unhappiness, places where uninspired, unappreciated minds went to wither.
  - For that reason, my employees' happiness is paramount, to the degree that I tell my clients up front that I care about my employees first, their customers second, and them last.

- What role does internal culture play in a company's success?
  - Building a strong internal culture is one of the best ways to ensure success for your company.
  - Sales matter, profits matter, customer relationships matter, but every one of those pieces of your business—in fact, every piece of your business—is affected by the culture.
  - Culture is a product of people, and when people aren't happy and instead are constantly thinking of a way to get out, their work will reflect it.
  - Wouldn't it make sense, then, to make your culture a priority? And given that people shape culture, wouldn't it make sense to keep it at the forefront of your mind every time you hire?
- Building a strong internal culture: you hire one. Hiring/firing becomes an emotional one, not a financial one. You have to think about how every hiring and firing will affect the collective community before taking action.
- Possible culture thing: helping someone find another job once they leave the company.
- Time management tips:
  - Hire an assistant and make them the czar of your time.
  - ***Make time management your religion. Learn to say no to the things that keep you out of the clouds and dirt.***
- What do you look for when hiring creatives? Those who love their art and love businesses. Those who aren't held up by romantic notions of artistic integrity.
- Prioritizing projects?
  - The biggest fires where I get the biggest upside if I put them out quickly. Whatever the most immediate concern is.
- Making meetings faster? Just cut them in half. The talking expands or contracts based on the length of the meeting.

- What's one question you ask in interviews?
  - "Where do you want your career to go?"
  - I welcome chaos and love to take advantage of trends, but I hate change at the personal level. I want to keep people in my ecosystem forever, because once I like working with you, I want to work with you forever. And I know the best way to keep you close is to deliver on what you want, so the faster I can get that insight, the better.

- ***What three values do you hold highest in life?***
  - *Patience.* There is no immediate gratification when it comes to business.
    - You can do amazing things, and get nothing back for a good long while.
    - But I want to work with people who have the patience to keep going even when they haven't seen immediate results, people who appreciate that success takes time.
    - I've seen how a lack of patience can keep people from achieving their greatest aspirations, and I want to work with those who will.
  - *Word is bond.*
    - I want everyone at VaynerMedia to believe it, too. When you make a commitment, no matter what, you stick to it. The best part? Every time you live up to this credo, you add one more person to your list of people who may deliver for you in the future.
  - *Empathy.*
    - I hire for this one because I know it's what makes a great leader.
    - I need to know that my managers are going to listen to their teams and work with them, not drive them, especially when problems arise.
  - *Gratitude.*
    - I like people who don't take anything for granted. It makes for a really motivated worker, and generally a nice person to work with.
- Would you support Vayner employees who wrote their own books and curated their own content streams and personal brands?
  - I not only would, I already have. Ask Jason Donnelly. He left VaynerMedia to go write a book, and when he was done he came back. I bought copies and gave it to people throughout the office.
  - I didn't do that to be nice. You can't say you care about helping people succeed and then suppress them when they actually do. And you can't be afraid that someone else will trump you. *That's one advantage to having a big ego—when you think you're the greatest of all time, you're not ever worried anyone else will surpass you, so there's no reason to hold them back.*
  - I have no reason to fear anyone else's talent or keep them down. If they wind up being better than me, so be it. I believe in capitalism, meritocracy, and fairness, and that's what it should look like.

- How do you push your team beyond their best?
  - The wrong way is to crack the whip and compensate for the brutal work conditions by paying people well.
  - The right way in this one man's point of view is to appeal to their sense of guilt. (I'm not joking.)
  - 51-49.
  - A good boss is doing his employees a favor when he or she pushes a team beyond their limits, because otherwise they'd never know what they were capable of.
  - But you have to make them believe they can do it before they actually do it. If you want people to over-deliver, you'd better over-deliver for them, too.

- How do you hold your employees accountable, aka actually do work and get results? I mean it's not like you can send them to their room, and firing them still leaves you with no work done.
  - ***Company culture.*** If you're able to build an environment where people really enjoy the work they're doing, believe in the mission at hand, and (most important) really love their coworkers, you probably won't encounter these circumstances in the first place.
    - I'm often shocked to see employees at VaynerMedia who are more afraid to fail their coworkers than anything else. The best results come when employees feel like their responsibility is toward their teammates more than a charismatic boss, or a client, or even their own pride.
  - ***I think you do fire.*** If you're in the mind-set that firing someone will leave you with no one to do the job, then you're in big trouble.
  - ***Finally, I really do think it comes down to communication.*** Once the problem is agreed upon by both parties (and make sure it is!), you need to figure out what makes that person tick.

- What are your thoughts on employing friends?
  - Working with friends is the best, and it works if you practice a meritocracy.
  - A lot of managers will probably disagree with me. They'll say it can ruin a friendship, and that nepotism is inevitable and lowers people's motivation to work hard.
  - Rather than being a risk, there's a huge benefit to hiring a friend with just as much experience as a stranger.
  - I hired my best childhood friend, Brandon, to work at Wine Library because I knew he was awesome from our baseball card days and I trusted and loved him.
  - When my brother, AJ, and I started VaynerMedia, we hired a handful of AJ's friends from college and high school to get the ball rolling because we knew that these particular individuals would bring a certain energy to the company and establish a fun, awesome, hardworking, passionate, and competitive culture right off the bat.
  - ***The key to hiring friends successfully is simple: Be ready to enforce a meritocracy. Sometimes it can be hard to divorce yourself from your friendship and evaluate people solely on their work performance, but it is possible.***

- ***I think the biggest challenge that most freelancers have is that while they are great at their individual specialty (design, consulting, video, etc.), they don't actually know how to run a business.***
  - The difference between having expertise in an individual skill and being a business operator is huge, and at the end of the day being a freelancer means you're running your own, one-person business.
  - A freelancer's biggest asset is time, so any tools or software that can help to save time is going to be huge.
  - The other thing that might be helpful would be to find a business mentor, or even take business classes.
  - Learn everything you possibly can about business management so that you can worry less about the side stuff, and spend more time on the fun stuff.

- What does it take to work at VaynerMedia?
  - The losing players at the VaynerMedia game tend to disappear within the first year or year and a half because they're not playing the long game. They're either solely motivated by money, or they have the audacity to think they're better than they are.
  - I like bravado and confidence, but you'd better have the goods to back it up. Admittedly, on occasion VaynerMedia has missed that talent and the employee had no choice but to leave. I hate it when that happens, but even I know we can't always win.
  - ***What about the winners? They tend to have all the qualities we've discussed before: empathy, self-awareness, respect for others, amazing work ethic, and patience. They're not only good communicators; they advocate for themselves in a constructive way (hey, I know we're not perfect).***
  - It takes hard work and smarts to succeed here, but what trumps all of it is heart. Skills can be taught; heart just is. If you've got it, I'm interested in working with you.

- How can efficiency and creativity better work together?
  - To get creatives to be efficient, you need to hire creative people. You want everyone in your company to matter whether they're on the account, client, or creative side, and to be thinking of better ways to do what they're doing.
  - I think one way to do that is to put your players in a position to succeed.

- I think any boss worth his or her salt will be pumped if you're brave enough to respectfully point out where you disagree, and I think it can be a win-win situation.
  - If the boss agrees with your feedback, you've won points.
  - For that reason, there's no risk in giving critical feedback, especially if you don't love your job.
- Here's a challenge: When you're having trouble with a partner, don't get aggressive or nasty. Win them over with kindness. Go for a drink together if you can. Build a real relationship and you may just find that they know they stink because their company stinks. When you can find some common ground and a way to align yourselves it can take some of the venom out of the situation and make you feel less resentful.

- If you have a business that is growing fast, is it more important to perfect the system or to focus on adding more people to the team?
  - Why can't you do both? It takes hustle, but that's the only way to get huge victories.
  - I worked very hard on the system at VaynerMedia while hiring people and trading them up and building the team.
  - Integrate the team from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., and then spend 5 P.M. to 2 A.M. perfecting the system.
  - Go all the "hell in" now or you will miss your moment. Extract all the value you can out of your day while you still can, especially if you're young.
  - That's what I'm doing as I approach my fortieth birthday. My fund, The #AskGaryVee Show, VaynerMedia, family life, my health . . . I'm pushing it all harder than ever because I know that when I'm forty-two I may not be able to do it as much. Squeeze everything you can out of the time you have right now.

# CHAPTER 16 INVESTING

- I learned from my mistake and was lucky enough to go on to become part of a small group of "super angels," men and women with personal brand awareness, like Kevin Rose, Chris Sacca, and Jason Calacanis, looking for opportunities to invest. I later made some nice investments in companies like Wildfire and Birchbox, and eventually in late 2013 I started a venture fund with Stephen Ross, Matt Higgins, and my brother called VaynerRSE, a $20 million seed fund that invests in early-stage Internet media companies. By the time you're reading this I'll have another one called Vayner Capital, which is a later-stage venture fund.
- What should I focus on with the companies that I invest in?
  - When considering whether to make any investment, make sure that the idea looks phenomenal on paper and that it is in good hands.

- If I don't believe in the upside in your market, I'm not going to believe in your start-up.
- Today I'm looking less at social networks and apps and more at things like smart tech.
  - For example, who is going to win with the smart toothbrush that stops when you have fully brushed your teeth? Or smart pants? Who is going to win in a sector like e-sports? I also think there is a lot of potential in consumer packaged goods as companies try to make healthier versions of everything we already have. Mobile commerce is also interesting to me. Virtual reality. I'm looking at trends. So when I'm looking at horses, I'm following my own intuition, which has rarely served me wrong, to help me see what is gaining traction and will soon be mainstream.

- Does instability with China and the macroeconomic environment affect how you see the world?
  - When I first started getting involved in investments in the mid-2000s, companies were valued at $2–3 million, even if they had pretty strong seasoned entrepreneurs. Currently it's not unusual for kids fresh out of school to get an $8–12 million valuation. That is aggressive inflation and it only happens during good times.

# CHAPTER 17 SELF-AWARENESS

- How to? Straight up asking people to tell you your strengths and weaknesses.
  - You have to be prepared for them to tell you things you may not want to hear or that you disagree with. That's why you have to gather a diversity of opinion.
  - Embrace the people who tell you you're full of crap. Double down on those relationships, because they're the ones that will help you improve the most.
  - Get yourself a thick skin. I hate reading bad stuff about me, but I can handle it.
  - I respect it, accept it, understand it, and I try to learn from it.
  - ***If you're aggressive about getting the feedback, and man or woman enough to "eat it," you can make changes in your interactions with people and your approach to business that can pay off in big ways.***
- What's the most common mistake founders make when building a consumer-focused business?
  - ***There are so many goddamn mistakes, but the biggest is when they delude themselves into thinking they are significantly more talented and special than they really are.***
  - The audacity is ludicrous and stunning to me. People underestimate how hard it is to build a consumer app and create something sticky that people care about.
  - It takes a special talent, yet career students, corporate people, and bright-eyed hustlers think somehow they're going to understand consumer behavior and scratch that itch for a consumer product better than anyone else.
  - So the mistake? Not having the self-awareness to know they're not good enough to do it.

- I do the same thing when I bash TV advertising. It's not that I don't believe it has a purpose or value, but I don't need to advocate for it because 99 percent of the market already does, and it is grossly overpriced. TV doesn't need me. Self-awareness does.
- ***What people don't realize is that the process of forcing yourself to be self-aware requires drinking a shitload of humble Kool-Aid. It's insane how much humility has been instilled into me by the market and has balanced my ego and self-esteem. I get why people think I'm full of myself, but what they're seeing is the postgame of a long period during which I learned to stay away from what I'm not good at so that I only talk about the things that I know I'm better at than most people.***
  - Everything should be in balance, so when the market is leaning so strongly in the direction of "Everything Is Awesome!" I think there is an opportunity to talk about how some people need to understand they suck.
  - Now, here's the thing. If you do suck but you love the thing you suck at, do it! If you love singing more than breathing, go for that singing career.
  - I would just like it if you could go for it with the full realization that you're most likely going to wait tables for your entire life.
  - You can't be disappointed if you go in with your eyes wide open. I'm not immune to FOMO, but I knew that to do what I do I'd have to leave a lot of fun and leisure on the table. You always pay a price for doing what you love. That's just life.

- How does humor play a role in business, if at all?
  - It does, and it plays the same role it plays in all of life—by easing tensions, greasing wheels, making people feel good.
  - Wouldn't you rather do business with someone who makes you laugh than with a stick in the mud? A gift for humor happens to be one of the most attractive personal traits, and maybe one of the rarest.
  - I use humor inspired by stand-up comedy in my keynotes because I think it helps people remember (and enjoy) my talks more. I also use it to drive difficult HR conversations, and leverage it when I'm selling to clients.
  - ***As attractive as a sense of humor is, though, it's no more important than the other ones people are attracted to: caring, empathy, self-awareness, kindness, and beauty, among others. But if you know you've got it, use it.***


- What was the biggest decision in your life that made you successful today?
  - It was the day I made the choice to suck at school.
  - I made the conscious decision to eat the pain four times a year when report cards came, to eat the pain of failing pretty much daily. Who cared if everyone thought I was a "loser," a kid without a shot? I knew better.
  - *It's not that I didn't care. I went to every class. I was respectful to my teachers. I just decided that I would be better off honing my skills and concentrating on what made me happy and what fulfilled me.*
  - ***That moment marked the first time that I decided to fight what society expected of me and deliver on what made me happy. And you should, too. Bottom line: Stop doing things that make you unhappy.***
  - I've been preaching this since my first book came out, and long before that. Sure, it sucked to get those report cards every quarter, but sometimes you have to take a thousand punches before anything good happens.
  - Not everyone will understand what you're doing, and the more you work, the more chances you have to be disappointed. Or even to be the disappointment. But don't let those moments fool you. An instance of failure could be a huge opportunity.
  - Pay attention. Learn to be self-aware. One F on a test got me started. Countless bad report cards got me going. And if I could go back, I would fail every single test all over again.

- How do I keep low self-confidence from keeping me from succeeding?
  - *Self-esteem is the ultimate drug of our society. When you have it you give yourself the audacity to dream big, and when you do that, the little things stop mattering and anxiety cannot cripple you.*
  - I'm probably the least anxious person I know, even though you might think I should be, with all the responsibilities I carry on my shoulders. It's just that I have such strong self-esteem. (Thank you, Mom, you are truly amazing.) I'm absolutely sure that I can handle whatever comes my way.
  - I wish I could give people who struggle with this issue a rah-rah "you can do it!" answer, because without self-esteem, I'm not sure they can. That said, if you are self-aware enough to know that you lack confidence, you could definitely execute to get more.
  - You need to do research and think hard about what you can afford to do. A lot of people would probably benefit from seeing a therapist who could help them work through whatever is keeping their confidence down.
  - At the very least, start working to surround yourself with confident, positive people. Be as determined to get that self-esteem as an addict jonesing for a hit.

# CHAPTER 18 GARYVEE'S GUIDE TO PUBLIC SPEAKING WITHOUT SHITTING YOUR PANTS

- Fun fact: I did not give my first public speech until 2006, when I was thirty-one years old.
  - It was at an Internet conference, and I really didn't know what to expect. But the second I took that stage my world was never the same.
  - There may be no greater high for me than that second right before I walk out onstage; it feels like home. It's no secret that I like to hear myself talk, and this gives me the perfect excuse, but I really do tremendously enjoy connecting with my audience. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to speak to so many people on a regular basis.
  - If you've done a good job of building your brand, there is a good chance someone will ask you for an interview, or to sit on a panel, and eventually, if you're really good, to host a conference or deliver a keynote address.
  - When this starts happening to you, you'll know you're on your way. It's not only fun, it's lucrative. I love it. I really freaking love it. I hope I can make you love it, too, if you're like I was and unaware that it was even in your skill set.

- How do you prepare for an important keynote?
  - Finding a way to free yourself from your fear of public speaking is an extremely worthwhile investment, because if you succeed, it sets the potential for an enormous boon to your brand and business.
  - Reach new audiences you might not have encountered, build your credibility.
  - Prep: still do everyday things, but before showtime, I focus but do not recheck the speech. Then, right before I go out onstage, I think about punching every audience member directly in the mouth.

- How do you get away with so many f-bombs onstage?
  - *Second, I get away with dropping f-bombs because I just don't fucking care if I catch flak for it. In fact, I use the f-bomb all the time to vet people with whom I do business. How you react to me tells me a whole lot about you. If you're operating at such a micro level you can't get beyond my language to hear the bigger message I'm trying to communicate to you, you're just not someone I want to do business with or take on as a client. You're never judging me half as much as I'm judging you.*
- As a speaker, you rarely use filler words and you hardly ever lose your train of thought onstage, or in front of the camera. Can you provide insight into how you've nurtured your public speaking chops?
  - I've had a lot of practice since the first time I hit the stage in 2006, and here is the biggest secret I have learned for a flawless presentation: Talk about what you know.
  - Don't let people suck you into a debate about a topic in which you're neither interested nor well versed.
  - The only reason my opinion matters about anything is that I am a practitioner and have grounded my execution in strong research and experience.
  - I'm not providing value if I start spouting opinions based on nothing more than a few clickbait headlines.

# CHAPTER 19 MUSIC

- Most people who care about the art form do not respect my relationship with music. I have no musical talent and my contemporaries often disrespect my taste. One of my favorite things to do is put a favorite song on continuous loop and listen to it for five to seven hours.
- *Do you have any idea how many bands and artists have been able to break out and become profitable because they knew how to use social media like Vine and YouTube to reach their audiences? These are the same bands that would never have been able to get so much as a meeting with a major label fifteen years ago.*
- That's why I don't understand why so many people continue to bemoan the fate of the music industry and complain that musicians can't get a fair shake. They sure as hell can. If they hustle, that is. They just have to stop thinking of themselves as artists and start thinking of themselves as a business.
- Since music itself doesn't create income anymore, what advice do you have for musicians wanting to make their living playing music in the twenty-first century?
- *Let's get some perspective—throughout history, maybe 1 percent of all musicians, singers, and songwriters ever made it big. Most professional musicians worked their whole lives making the best living they could doing what they loved, while supplementing their income doing work that they did not love.*
- Just like many other entrepreneurs, artists can make a perfectly livable income through AdSense, YouTube ads, sponsored social media content, and Beatport sales, which leaves them more free to devote their working hours to honing their craft, distributing their music, engaging with fans and music venues, and creating their own opportunities to perform live.
- In fact, according to a New York Times article called "The Creative Apocalypse That Wasn't," "More people are choosing to make a career as a musician or a songwriter than they did in the glory days of Tower Records, with as many as forty-six possible revenue streams available to them."
- Brand awareness: Snapchat, Youtube, Vine, Instagram, SoundCloud.
- Most musicians think their art is their priority, but your audience needs to be, too.
- As a private music teacher I have limited hours to teach. Thoughts on how to increase my income and brand?
  - Of course I do.
  - There are entire industries that have been transformed by tech, allowing people who work on opposite sides of the globe to connect and collaborate.
  - Who says your students all have to be in your time zone? There are doctors who treat patients, and accountants who consult with clients, via Skype.
  - Why couldn't a music teacher do the same? Offer classes on Skillshare. Take a page from online education and start marketing yourself to people who don't have easy access to good music instruction. Find the need and fill it.
- Another strategy would be to monetize the hours when you're not teaching. Start putting out content—blog posts, videos, podcasts, anything—about music, teaching, cultural events, and any other topics that are even tangentially related to your business and give you a chance to show who you are and build trust.
  - Use Twitter Search and engage with people who love music, or who have kids who love music, or who might be interested in music classes, or even to connect with other teachers.
  - Offer tutorials on Spreecast or Meerkat (I'm an investor), start a YouTube Channel, and take advantage of Google hangouts. The options are endless for creative entrepreneurs.
  - Does all of that sound like a lot of work? It is.
  - How people react to the prospect of so much work is really what differentiates between those who build successful small businesses and those who eventually give up and go work for someone else.
  - If you love the work—if the idea of putting yourself out there and sharing your love for your art and reaching more and more students gets you excited—then there's no reason why you can't make this work for you.
  - *If you're overwhelmed by it all and just can't imagine giving up Game of Thrones or the many other activities that take up hours in our days, you're really not cut out for it.*
  - Your talent is what it is, but the level at which you increase your income and brand is limited only by the scope of your ambition and willingness to hustle. Nothing more, nothing less.

# CHAPTER 20 SPORTS

# CHAPTER 21 WINE

- When someone gives you a horrible glass of wine, how do you politely get rid of it?
  - Actually, I like trying the occasional glass of bad wine because it makes me appreciate the good stuff so much more. And the same could be said for times when I'm asked to judge someone's content or social media presence on #AskGaryVee.
  - Often it's crap, and yet it's my job to point out how it could be better without tearing an entrepreneur or marketer down so viciously, he or she never wants to try again.
  - *And seeing the crap makes me appreciate it that much more when I see others executing their social media strategy and content well. Because producing quality, whether wine or webinars, takes major commitment and effort. And I respect that.*
  - The reality is that so long as you haven't experienced the difference between something high end and low end, it's hard to see what the big deal is. But in most cases, all it takes is one ride in first class, or one game in the front row of a stadium, or one sip of a Châteauneuf-du-Pape, and you'll wonder how you ever doubted its value.

# CHAPTER 22 THE PERSONAL, THE RANDOM, AND THE WEIRD

- Legend has it that on your first date with your wife you told her you would marry her. We want to know the details. And also, what dating advice do you have for women in their twenties?
  - Lizzie and I are married because the Jets won on the Sunday night we were supposed to go out for the first time. If they had lost, I would have canceled. But they didn't, and so I drove into New York City for what turned out to be a three-hour date at an awesome spot in Washington Square Park. She lived on the Upper East Side, and I lived in New Jersey. After dinner I dropped her off, and two minutes afterward I called her on her cell. She wasn't even in her apartment yet. And I said, "Can you believe this is it?" We talked during my forty-five-minute ride home, and then until about four in the morning. We were married within the year of our first date.
  - What dating advice would I give a young woman coming up in the world? The same advice I'd give a man: Think about your legacy.
  - ***Live on the offense. Don't be afraid to show your feelings and go for what you want, whether it's a job or a relationship.It's possible you'll get rejected, but it's more likely you won't. Better to experience the brief, temporary pain of rejection than to live forever with sad regret for all the things you were too scared to do.***

- The only thing I'm really scared of is reading in public. I am an atrocious reader. It's even affected how I run my business. In 2015 I started creating only 5–7-minute meetings with much of my staff because I don't read fast enough and therefore wasn't reading their emails in full ahead of time.

- What do you splurge on? Experiences. LeBron's first game back in Cleveland against the Knicks because AJ is a huge fan and it will be something we can attend and remember together when we're older. Vacations with my family. Paying for my friends to go on trips when they couldn't afford it. I splurge on spending time with people I care about.
- *Guess who you meet on a climb? People. Many on the same route as you. Find those who fascinate you, who challenge you, and who help you look forward to getting started every day. Treat them well, provide them with value, show them why you're worth keeping around, and you'll get tremendous return. I find the individuals I think I can jam with for the next fifteen, twenty, thirty years professionally, and I bring them into my circle to make them the next generation of operators.*
- When have you been happiest in life?
  - Because I'm a collector of good people and good moments.
  - The birth of children.
  - The Jets beating the Patriots in the playoffs.
  - Getting standing ovations at important business conferences.
  - I'm all about momentum and clout.
  - Every day that goes by in which good things keep happening, and there is no sickness or sadness in my family, feels like the next big day. All I have to do is just keep building on each day, one after the next.
- *You know, earlier I listed my biggest fears, but I forgot to mention this one: I'm afraid that eventually the climb will be over and I will become bitter when I realize all the things I wasn't able to capitalize, all the moments I missed. That's why I pray that I'll never actually reach the other side, and that my life can always be about the climb. I hope I feel that way up until I take my last breath.*

- Don't edit this, DRock! I'm sure if you've watched/listened to the show you've heard Gary shout this to me.
  - I've learned that speed is super-valuable and quality is subjective to that.
  - Gary values authenticity over everything, and it's not often that you find someone as scrappy and fast as Gary; he's super-entertaining. Ever since day one I've loved the energy that he brings to the camera. It makes my job that much more enjoyable.
  - When we were starting I would always get frustrated with the "bad audio," especially in episode 5, and Gary would remind me that it's okay and we just need to learn how to get faster, so since then I've strived for a quicker turnaround time while still making slight improvements to the quality of the show (we've gotten great audio now, whew!).
  - *If you want to go and create your own videos, I want you to stop getting caught up on what camera to buy, and what mic has the BEST sound. You don't need the BEST to start. Grab your iPhone, hold it at arm's length, and start, and whatever you do—provide value. This is No. 1.*
  - Wanna see something really cool? Check out episode 1 of WineLibrary TV, then skip ahead to episode 598. See how Gary's personality shifted from quiet and reserved to outgoing and absolutely entertaining? He found his voice. Now for a more recent example, check out episode 1 of #AskGaryVee, then check the most recent episode . . . let me guess, you see that same difference? He had to find his voice again.
- *Why the big difference? We began to find our cadence; we evolved. As we continued to crank out episodes we were able to make slight adjustments little by little and we continue to do so.*
