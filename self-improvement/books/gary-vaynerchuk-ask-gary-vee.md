# Ask Gary Vee

# INTRODUCTION

- Feb 21, 2006: Wine Library TV. 999 episodes.
- David Rock for video, Steve Unwin/India Kieser for copy, Zak Moy for design.
- I like the Q&A part because that's when people realize that I'm not a clever speaker but an actual practitioner.
- Ask Gary Vee's appeal on millenials reaffirms my belief that there are gaping holes in the educ system. They need practical, tactical information, not just theory.
- Why a book?
  - Takes time to watch all episodes.

# CHAPTER 1 CLOUDS AND DIRT

- The clouds are the high-end philosophy and beliefs that are at the heart of everything I am personally and everything I do professionally.
- Bring value to the customer.
  - Provide 51 percent of the value in a relationship, whether it's with an employee, a client, or a stranger.
  - Always play the long game of lifetime value.
  - Smart work will never replace hard work; it only supplements it.
  - People are your most important commodity.
  - Patience matters.
  - Never be romantic about how you make your money.
  - Try to put yourself out of business daily.

- The dirt: hard work.
  - Communicating with my loved ones.
  - Showing up and staying present.
  - Apologizing when I mess up.
  - Making sure that this doesn't happen that much.
  - Knowing the craft.

- The middle?
  - I live people who are on a raw level, executing. They are engaging and experimenting and trying things that risk getting them ridiculed. They are people who are looking far into the future.
  - ***If you have pages and pages of notes, but no product, you've got nothing.*** If you can't tell me how you're going to build your product, you've got nothing. And if you're only thinking three years into the future, you've got a huge vulnerability.
  - Vagueness sucks. Lack of drive sucks. Half-assing things sucks. And so does the middle.

- Where do you see yourself in five years?
  - Five years ago, there was no Instagram, Snapchat, GoPro, Netflix as it is today.
  - I will check patterns, track them down, and adjust.

- What would you prioritize as a one-person business? Cash flow. No second. You need product, team, and service. Figure out your strength and drill deep with them. Your strongest skill is its DNA.
  - Bet on your strengths.

# CHAPTER 2 STARTING OUT

- 2 things that bring people value: entertainment and utility.
- On great business names: nothing to do with your name. Go with an abbreviation if you need to. If the product sucks, the name means nothing.
- What was the hardest thing about starting up VaynerMedia from scratch? There were a lot of possible things to do, and this is what I chose.

- I love my job but I want to do my own blog and my own hustle. But I'm crippled when it comes to executing.
  - Would you be so afraid if you knew no one was watching?
  - I don't think what scares people is not fear of failure, but fear of failing in front of someone who matters.
  - ***But if you want to be an entrepreneur—if that's what you really, really want—you cannot give a shit about what other people think of you. Not even your parents.***

- What's the best way to deal with someone who is negative about entrepreneurship? What if it's your mom?
  - The best way to solve this is to just execute and win.
  - Also, ask yourself: do you believe in you? IF yes, then no one else's opinion really matters. Prove them right or prove them wrong, either way, you're better off for trying.

- When trying to create a new media property (say, something at the intersection of food and tech, with no real precedents), how do you find and forge the right partnerships, that is, people with resources and access?
  - Ask first what I can do for them. Usually from following them on social media.
  - Spec work/services.

- How do I get the first ten customers for a creative service start-up?
  - Cold call. To get those first ten customers, you have to grind.
- Every industry has its market leaders—companies who have done good work in the past and have become the default solution for their client base. Your goal is to become one of those leaders.
- ***So first you have to get over your resentment of the competition and realize that you haven't done crap to establish your brand. The way you can overcome that, in my opinion, is to deliver great work and start creating word of mouth. It's just grinding and going through the process.***
- First client: grind. Biz dev, networking, advertising, putting out content. Pure execution.
- Finding a coder: meetup.com.
- Promoting an app: content, content, content. Then pound the community. Jabs and right hooks to build a brand.

- What are the biggest mistakes you see young entrepreneurs make?
  - You're building businesses that only work during best-case market scenarios.
  - A stock collapse will happen.
  - Build solid teams, good products, and excel at sales. Without sales, you've got nothing.

# CHAPTER 3 EDUCATION

- One course you can teach? Exploring the disconnect between school and the entrepreneurial world.
- On Twitter: tweet and engage. Medium = the platform that offers virality to people who have no audience.
- Don't be a student, be a practitioner.
- Casey on degrees: "In life you should only be doing two things ever: discovering your passion and then realizing it. If you know what you want and that trajectory doesn't necessitate a college education, then skip it."
  - If you suck at painting, then maybe you can try out graphic design.

# CHAPTER 4 FAMILY BUSINESS

- One of the best ways to go out of business is to make emotional decisions, to get romantic about how you make your money, or to let your emotions get in the way of the task at hand.
- If you and your family love each other more than you love the business, you will succeed.
- Whatever the kids do, I'll love them unconditionally. All we ask is that whatever they choose to do, they give it all their heart and do it to the best of their abilities.
- Success is not a game of absolutes. You can be in a relationship and have family obligations and have a business.
- AJ: Mature and self-aware and adds tremendous value to the company. When going into a business with a family member, be the bigger man or woman.
- Vayner: We have friends and family in both businesses. No one gets put in a power position unless they've earned it.

# CHAPTER 5 PARENTING

- Parents: let and encouraged him to do what he wants and what he was good at.
- How do you keep someone from being a spoiled, self-centered brat? When I did something wrong, she treated that as an extraordinary thing, too.
- Pumping everyone confidence makes for a more creative, risk-taking environment.
- Super-privileged background:
  - Did their parents spoil them or did they make them work for what they wanted?
  - Did they teach them the value of having money?
  - Did they talk to them about how money factors into our country's discussions about class, education, and politics, or how the goods we take for granted are considered luxuries somewhere else?

# CHAPTER 6 HUSTLE

- People almost never increase their natural talent, but they can transform themselves by increasing their hustle.
- If you're not born with it, you can get it.
- You have to spend more time doing whatever it is that takes you where you want to go. Do more than the competition. And do it every single day.
- ***I'm self-aware enough to know I have a lot of talent, but it's my work ethic—my hustle—that has been a substantial backbone to my success. I will outwork anyone. How about you? You can be a phenomenal content creator, but if you lack passion or a willingness to sweat there is someone else out there who is going to make more opportunities for herself and more money than you. Don't let that happen. Put down Clash of Clans. Binge-watch Game of Thrones or Walking Dead next year. And get to work.***


- ***Look at your level of hustle and evaluate it. Ask yourself, Am I working as hard as I could? Am I doing great work? If you work for yourself and the answer is no, think long and hard about the business you have started or the consulting work you're doing. Is it a good fit? Are you playing to your strengths? Would you be more motivated and feel more confident if you worked with a partner? If you're working for someone else, and you feel like you're not living up to your potential, please consider finding a new place to work. If you want to succeed, you've got to surround yourself with the right kind of people. Go where you are motivated to take risks. Be with people who allow you to make your best work. Your DNA matters, but make sure your circumstances are allowing you to win.***
- Now, once you have a product, there could be tons of things you could do to promote a local business—Facebook ads, tweets, geolocation, mobile ads, Google AdWords—the options are tremendous.
- Smaller companies: work more.
- E-commerce: Facebook ads. AdWords. Biz dev.
- For the first 8 years, 1998-2006, there is nothing about Gary Vaynerchuk.
  - I was working. I was learning, practicing, questioning, researching, and experimenting.
  - I was building the expertise and experience that would allow me to position myself as an authority, not just in the wine world but in the business world as well.
  - Today I can say I built two $50 million businesses in five-year periods, and showed a talent for investing in companies early and making a lot of money.
  - I can rattle off an educated answer to almost any question about wine or Internet business you can throw at me. You think I came by all that knowledge overnight? I got in the trenches and lived my business and did the work that allowed me to build the Gary Vaynerchuk brand. I created reasons for people to think I was worth paying attention to and even worth spending money on to hear me speak at events or read my books.

- How do you avoid procrastination so well?
  -  What some people might call procrastinating I call reprioritizing. I'm in constant audit mode adjusting to real life all the time.
  - Something might be super-important one day only to get demoted the next when I open my inbox in the morning.
  - Trying to keep track of what's most important and when can drive my assistant crazy.
- Mark my words, if you tell me you're hustling, I will go to your Instagram or Twitter account and take a look at your work.
  - I will click the posts and hit the profile where it says "view all with replies," and I'll study the engagement rates.
  - I love it when I see one engagement after another with just some retweets.

- The biggest excuse? If you are serious about reaching your dreams, nothing will get in the way. Never make excuses. Love taking the blame. Stop saying "but" and you'll be forced to move forward, and there will be nothing standing in your way anymore.

# CHAPTER 7 CONTENT AND CONTEXT

- ***People buy with their hearts, not their heads, and the way to every consumer's heart is through a good story.***
- What defines quality content nowadays?
  - It appeals to the heart.
  - It's shareable.
  - It's native to the platform on which it appears.
  - It breaks through the noise.
- Everyone will be a media company.
- Medium/LinkedIn: have a similar intellectual vibe and can share their audience.
