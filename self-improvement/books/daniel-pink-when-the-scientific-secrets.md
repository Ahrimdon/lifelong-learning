# 1. THE HIDDEN PATTERN OF EVERYDAY LIFE

- 500 million tweets, 2.4 million users, 84 countries.
  - Tweeters rose in the morning, plummeted in the afternoon, and climbed back up in the early evening. Each weekday was the same. Positive affect was higher on the weekends, but it mainly stayed the same.
  - Peak, trough, and rebound.
  - Suprachiasmatic nucleus: controls the rise and fall of our body temperature, regulates the hormones, and helps us fall asleep at night and awaken in the morning.
  - Human beings "open" and "close" at regular times during the day. Different times for everyone, but same contour.
- People often use social media to present and ideal face to the world that might mask their true, and less ideal, emotions.
  - Day reconstruction method: reconstruct the previous day and tell how they felt while doing it. People are least happy while commuting and most happy while canoodling.
- Earnings calls in the morning: upbeat and positive. As the day progresses: the tone grows more negative. Lunchtime: mood rebounds slightly.
  - Afternoon calls: more negative, irritable, and combative.
  - Same for stereotypes. Mental keenness was greater early in the day. Mental squishiness increased as the day wore on.
- Conclusions:
  - We are smarter/faster/more creative in some parts of the day than others.
  - These fluctuations are more extreme than we realize. Almost the same as the effect between normal and drinking and the legal limit of alcohol.
  - The best time to perform a task depends on the nature of that task.
  - Logical thinking: mornings.
  - Insight problems: more likely to get solved in the afternoon. Flash of illuminance: afternoon.

- Chronotype: a personal pattern of circadian rhythms that influences our physiology and psychology.
  - Genetics, age: children are larks, and super old people are larks. College-aged people are disproportionately owls. 20-25% of the population are solid evening types.
- Owls: More open and extroverted. More neurotic, impulsive, hedonists. But greater creativity, working memory, intelligence scores, sense of humor.
- People are less likely to lie and cheat on tasks in the morning that later in the day.
- Equally important, no matter whether you spend your days making cars or teaching children, beware of that middle period. The trough, as we're about to learn, is more dangerous than most of us realize.

## WHAT TO DO IF YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE

1. *Be aware.* As an owl, prepare everything for the meeting the night before. Before you sit down at the conference table, go for a quick walk outside—ten minutes or so. Or do a small good deed for a colleague—buy him a coffee or help him carry some boxes—which will boost your mood.
2. *Work the margins.* Spend the important time doing your important work. "I get the most done during the so-and-so."
- Exercise in the morning to:
  - Lose weight/fasted training.
  - Boost mood.
  - Keep to your routine.
  - Build strength.
- Exercise in the late afternoon or evening to:
  - Avoid injury: When our muscles are warm, they're more elastic and less prone to injury.
  - Perform your best: Lung function is highest this time of the day, so your circulation system can distribute more oxygen and nutrients. This is also the time of day when strength peaks, reaction time quickens, hand-eye coordination sharpens, and heart rate and blood pressure drop.
  - *In fact, a disproportionate number of Olympic records, especially in running and swimming, are set in the late afternoon and early evening.*
  - Enjoy the workout a bit more: People typically perceive that they're exerting themselves a little less in the afternoon even if they're doing exactly the same exercise routine as in the morning.

## FOUR TIPS FOR A BETTER MORNING

- *Drink a glass of water when you wake up.*
- *Don't drink coffee immediately after you wake up.*
- Soak up the morning sun.
- Schedule talk-therapy appointments for the morning. Cortisol, stress hormone, and it enhances learning.


# 2. AFTERNOONS AND COFFEE SPOONS

- Afternoons suck for hospitals. Expect a decline in vigilance.
- When the Danish students had breaks to eat, play, and chat, their scores did not decline (for afternoon things).

- What should breaks look like?
  - *Something beats nothing.* Short breaks from a task can prevent habituation, help us maintain focus, and reactivate our commitment to a goal. Frequent short breaks are more effective than occasional ones.
  - *Moving beats stationary.* Sitting is bad. Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday can be potent. These hourly five-minute walking breaks boosted energy levels, sharpened focus, and reduced feelings of fatigue in the late afternoon.
  - *Social beats solo.* In high-stress occupations like nursing, social and collective rest breaks not only minimize physical strain and cut down on medical errors, they also reduce turnover; nurses who take these sorts of breaks are more likely to stay at their jobs.
  - *Outside beats inside.* Being close to nature. Seeing plants.
  - *Fully detached beats semidetached.*

## THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY

- Should we all eat breakfast? The conventional view is a flaky and delicious yes. But as a leading British nutritionist and statistician says, "[T]he current state of scientific evidence means that, unfortunately, the simple answer is: I don't know."33
- Non–desk lunchers were better able to contend with workplace stress and showed less exhaustion and greater vigor not just during the remainder of the day but also a full one year later.

## SLEEPING ON THE JOB

- Naps: improve cognitive performance and boost mental/physical health.
- Pilots who napped show a 34% improvement in reaction time and twofold increase in alertness.
- Ideal naps: 10-20 minutes.

## HOW TO TAKE A PERFECT NAP

- *Find your afternoon trough time.*
- *Create a peaceful environment.*
- *Down a cup of coffee.*
- *Set a timer on your phone for twenty-five minutes.*
- *Repeat consistently.* There's some evidence that habitual nappers get more from their naps than infrequent nappers.

## PAUSE LIKE A PRO

-* Most expert musicians and athletes begin practicing in earnest around nine o'clock in the morning, hit their peak during the late morning, break in the afternoon, and then practice for a few more hours in the evening.*

# 3. BEGINNINGS

- Bad case for teenagers starting the day too early.
- For teenagers, beginning the school day before 8:30 a.m. can impair their health and hobble their grades, which, in turn, can limit their options and alter the trajectory of their lives.
  - For somewhat older people, beginning a career in a weak economy can restrict opportunities and reduce earning power well into adulthood.
  - Beginnings have a far greater impact than most of us understand. Beginnings, in fact, can matter to the end.
- Young people begin undergoing the most profound change in chronobiology of their lifetimes around puberty.
  - They fall asleep later in the evening and, left to their own biological imperatives, wake up later in the morning—a period of peak owliness that stretches into their early twenties.
  - Yet most secondary schools around the world force these extreme owls into schedules designed for chirpy seven-year-old larks.
  - "Adolescents who get less sleep than they need are at higher risk for depression, suicide, substance abuse and car crashes," according to the journal Pediatrics.

## STARTING AGAIN

- *The first day of the year is what social scientists call a "temporal landmark.*
  - Certain dates function like that Shell station. They stand out from the ceaseless and forgettable march of other days, and their prominence helps us find our way.
  - Gym visits increase at the start of each new week, month, and year.
  - Social landmarks and personal landmarks. These allow people to open "new mental accounts".
  - ***"Temporal landmarks interrupt attention to day-to-day minutiae, causing people to take a big picture view of their lives and thus focus on achieving their goals."***
- *Imbuing an otherwise ordinary day with personal meaning generates the power to activate new beginnings.*
- *Those who entered the job market in weak economies earned less at the beginning of their careers than those who started in strong economies—no big surprise. But this early disadvantage didn't fade. It persisted for as long as twenty years.*
- Getting higher pay earlier in a career: switch jobs fairly often.
- Research on Stanford MBAs has found that the state of the stock market at the time of graduation shapes these graduates' lifetime earnings.
  -  First, students are more likely to take jobs on Wall Street when they graduate in a bull market. By contrast, in bear markets, a sizable portion of graduates choose alternatives—consulting, entrepreneurship, or working for nonprofits.
  - Second, people who work on Wall Street tend to remain working on Wall Street.
  - Third, investment bankers and other financial professionals generally out-earn those in other fields.
- This is a tough problem. If what you earn today depends heavily on the unemployment rate when you started working rather than on the unemployment rate now, the previous two strategies in this chapter—starting right and starting again—are insufficient.

## AVOID A FALSE START WITH A PREMORTEM

- The best way to recover from a false start is to avoid one in the first place. And the best technique for doing that is something called a "premortem."
  - Before the project begins, convene for a premortem. "Assume it's eighteen months from now and our project is a complete disaster," you say to your team. "What went wrong?" The team, using the power of prospective hindsight, offers some answers.
  - Maybe the task wasn't clearly defined. Maybe you had too few people, too many people, or the wrong people. Maybe you didn't have a clear leader or realistic objectives. By imagining failure in advance—by thinking through what might cause a false start—you can anticipate some of the potential problems and avoid them once the actual project begins.
  - I projected two years from the start date and imagined that I'd written a terrible book or, worse, hadn't managed to write a book at all. Where did I go awry? ***After looking at my answers, I realized I had to be vigilant about writing every day, saying no to every outside obligation so I didn't get distracted, keeping my editor informed of my progress (or lack thereof), and enlisting his help early in untangling any conceptual knots.***
  - Then I wrote down the positive versions of these insights—for example, "I worked on the book all morning every morning at least six days a week with no distractions and no exceptions"—on a card that I posted near my desk.

## EIGHTY-SIX DAYS IN THE YEAR WHEN YOU CAN MAKE A FRESH START

- The first day of spring, summer, fall, and winter (four)
- Your country's Independence Day or the equivalent (one)
- The day of an important religious holiday—for example, Easter, Rosh Hashanah, Eid al-Fitr (one)
- Your birthday (one)
- A loved one's birthday (one)
- The first day of school or the first day of a semester (two)
- The first day of a new job (one)
- The day after graduation (one)
- The first day back from vacation (two)

- The anniversary of the day you started your job, the day you became a citizen, the day you adopted your dog or cat, the day you graduated from school or university (four)
- The day you finish this book (one)

## WHEN SHOULD YOU GO FIRST?

- Ballot.
- If you're not the default choice.
- Few competitors.
- Job interviews vs strong candidates.

## Four Situations When You Should Not Go First

- Default choice. Judges are more likely to stick with the default late in the day.
- Many competitors.
- Operating in an uncertain environment.
- If your competition is weak: going last highlights your differences.

## FOUR TIPS FOR MAKING A FAST START IN A NEW JOB

- ***Begin before you begin.*** Pick a specific day and time when you visualize yourself "transforming" into your new role.
  - *By mentally picturing yourself "becoming" a new person even before you enter the front door, you'll hit the carpet running.*
- ***Let your results do the talking.***
  - Concentrate on accomplishing a few meaningful achievements, and once you've gained status by demonstrating excellence, feel free to be more assertive.
- ***Stockpile your motivation.***
- ***Sustain your morale with small wins.***

### WHEN SHOULD YOU GET MARRIED?

- ***Wait until you're old enough (but not too old).***
- ***Wait until you've completed your education.***
- ***Wait until your relationship matures.***

# 4. MIDPOINTS

- Midpoints can bring us down. That's the slump. But they can also fire us up. That's the spark.
- Mid-life phase central feature: the inevitability of one's own eventual personal death.
- Mild slump in the middle of life?
  - One possibility is the disappointment of unrealized expectations.
  - In the middle, we relax our standards. Ex: cutting cards.
- As you approach the midway of something, you can have an "uh-oh" effect. You can make significant progress in a "concentrated midpoint burst".
- Midyear transactions shape company histories. Think of midpoints as a psychological alarm clock.

## HALFTIME SHOW

- Teams that were behind just one point were more likely to win, almost like being ahead by two points.
- Groups who think they were trailing a little would get better in the "second half".
- At the midpoint, imagine that you're behind, but only a little.

## FIVE WAYS TO REAWAKEN YOUR MOTIVATION DURING A MIDPOINT SLUMP

- ***Set interim goals.*** Change to goal from "Get to 25K" to "Get to 12K".
- ***Publicly commit to those interim goals.*** Avoid public shame.
- ***Stop your sentence midway through.***
- ***Don't break the chain (the Seinfeld technique).***
- ***Picture one person your work will help.***

## FIVE WAYS TO COMBAT A MIDLIFE SLUMP

- ***Prioritize your top goals (the Buffett technique).*** Do the top five goals, disregard the next twenty.
- ***Develop mid-career mentoring within your organization.*** Talking about mid-career slumps help us realize that it's fine to experience some ennui. Experienced employees can offer strategies for dealing with the slump.
- ***Mentally subtract positive events.*** Return to the present and remind yourself that life did go your way. Be grateful. Your life is more wonderful than you think.
- ***Write yourself a few paragraphs of self-compassion.***
  - Identify something about yourself that fills you with regret, shame, or disappointment. Then write down the specifics about how it makes you feel.
  - Then think about what someone who cares about you might say. They would probably be more forgiving than you.
- ***Wait.*** Slumps are normal, but they're also short-lived.

# 5.  ENDINGS

- Marathon: "A goal we promise ourselves. I just want to see what I can do."
- People in the last year of a life decade usually push themselves to do something. Last years of a decade are more "pushable" than the eight-years.
- 9-enders are overrepresented among first-time marathoners by a whopping 48%. Twenty-nine-year-olds were about twice as likely to run a marathon as twenty-eight-year-olds or thirty-year-olds.
- Nearing the end of a decade also seems to quicken a runner's pace.
- The earth doesn't care, but because we have short lives, we do things to keep track and see how we're doing.
- "I don't want that last year just to slip by."
- Higher suicide rate among 9-enders. Same for extramarital-affairs. The end of a decade triggers a re-energized pursuit of significance.
- Higher number of points at the end of the first half of games.
- Having a deadline motivates people to finish.
- James Dean effect: Endings alter our perception.
- ***The research shows that voters decide based on the election year's economy, not its totality.***
- Bad-to-good guy perceived better than good-to-bad guy.
- ***Yes, older people have much smaller social networks than when they were younger. But the reason isn't loneliness or isolation. The reason is both more surprising and more affirming. It's what we choose. As we get older, when we become conscious of the ultimate ending, we edit our friends.***
- After age sixty, the outer circle begins to decline, but the inner circle remains about the same size. Greater stability in the number of close social partners into late in life. Older people have fewer total friends not because of circumstance, but because they've begun a process of active pruning/removing peripheral partners with whom interactions are less emotionally meaningful.
- ***As people move through life, they become increasingly aware that time is in some sense ‘running out.'*** You want to make sure you make the right choice, and not to waste time on gradually diminishing future payoffs.
- ***"Socio-emotional selectivity." She argued that our perspective on time shapes the orientation of our lives and therefore the goals we pursue. When time is expansive and open-ended, as it is in acts one and two of our lives, we orient to the future and pursue "knowledge-related goals."***
  - We form social networks that are wide and loose, hoping to gather information and forge relationships that can help us in the future.
  - But as the horizon nears, when the future is shorter than the past, our perspective changes. While many believe that older people pine for yesteryear, Carstensen's body of work shows something else. "The primary age difference in time orientation concerns not the past but the present," she wrote.
- *When time is constrained and limited, as it is in act three, we attune to the now. We pursue different goals—emotional satisfaction, an appreciation for life, a sense of meaning. And these updated goals make people "highly selective in their choice of social partners" and prompt them to "systematically hone their social networks."*
  - We edit our relationships. We omit needless people. We choose to spend our remaining years with networks that are small, tight, and populated with those who satisfy higher needs.
- What spurs editing isn't just aging, but endings of any sort.
  - College seniors vs college freshmen.
  - When people are about to switch jobs or move to a new city, they edit their immediate social networks because their time in that setting is ending.
  - Even political transitions have this effect. In a study of people in Hong Kong four months before the territory's handover from Great Britain to the People's Republic of China in 1997, both young people and older folks narrowed their circles of friends.
  - Just as intriguing, the converse is also true: Expanding people's time horizons arrests their editing behavior.
- ***Yet, when endings become salient—whenever we enter an act three of any kind—we sharpen our existential red pencils and scratch out anyone or anything nonessential. Well before the curtain falls, we edit.***

##  ELEVATE: GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS, AND HAPPY ENDINGS

- More people prefer hearing bad news first, good news last.
- As news givers, we prefer good news first, bad news last.
- Humans prefer endings that elevate.
- Screenwriters: the very best endings are not always happy in the traditional sense. Up, Cars, Toy Story: "The character finally understands an emotionally complex truth."
  - Every Pixar movie has its protagonist achieving the goal he wants only to realize it is not what the protagonist needs.
  - Typically, this leads the protagonist to let go of what he wants to get what he needs.
- ***The researchers found that at the core of meaningful endings is one of the most complex emotions humans experience: poignancy, a mix of happiness and sadness.***
  - For graduates and everyone else, the most powerful endings deliver poignancy because poignancy delivers significance.
  - One reason we overlook poignancy is that it operates by an upside-down form of emotional physics.
  - Adding a small component of sadness to an otherwise happy moment elevates that moment rather than diminishes it.
  - "Poignancy," the researchers write, "seems to be particular to the experience of endings." The best endings don't leave us happy.
  - Instead, they produce something richer—a rush of unexpected insight, a fleeting moment of transcendence, the possibility that by discarding what we wanted we've gotten what we need.

## WHEN TO QUIT A JOB: A GUIDE

- ***Do you want to be in this job on your next work anniversary?*** People are most likely to leave a job on their one-year work anniversary. The second most likely time? Their two-year anniversary. The third? Their three-year anniversary. You get the idea. If you dread the thought of being at your job on your next work anniversary, start looking now. You'll be better prepared when the time comes.
- ***Is your current job both demanding and in your control?*** The most fulfilling jobs share a common trait: They prod us to work at our highest level but in a way that we, not someone else, control.
  - Jobs that are demanding but don't offer autonomy burn us out.
  - Jobs that offer autonomy but little challenge bore us.
- ***Does your boss allow you to do your best work?***
  - If your boss has your back, takes responsibility instead of blaming others, encourages your efforts but also gets out of your way, and displays a sense of humor rather than a raging temper, you're probably in a good place.
  - If your boss is the opposite, watch out—and maybe get out.
- ***Are you outside the three- to five-year salary bump window?***
  - One of the best ways to boost your pay is to switch organizations. And the best time to do that is often three to five years after you've started.
- ***Does your daily work align with your long-term goals?***
  - Ample research from many countries shows that when your individual goals align with those of your organization, you're happier and more productive.
  - So take a moment and list your top two or three goals for the next five years and ten years.
  - If your current employer can help you reach them, great. If not, think about an ending.

## FOUR AREAS WHERE YOU CAN CREATE BETTER ENDINGS

- The workday
  - But the science of endings suggests that instead of fleeing we're better off reserving the final five minutes of work for a few small deliberate actions that bring the day to a fulfilling close.
  - Begin by taking two or three minutes to write down what you accomplished since the morning.
- The semester or school year
  - For example, Anthony Gonzalez, an economics teacher at Nazareth Academy outside of Chicago, has his seniors write a letter to themselves—which he mails to them five years later.
  - "In it, they include wisdom from high school, guesses on careers, pay, what adventures they hope to go on, stock prices, and so on.

# 6. SYNCING FAST AND SLOW

- Syncing: Groups attune to the pacing preferences of their highest-status members.
- Dabbawalas: the most efficient food delivery system.
- A need to belong is a fundamental human motivation, and that much of what human beings do is done in the service of belongingness.
- Social cohesion leads to greater synchrony. Dabbawalas are not a corporation but a cooperative. There is a signifier (hat) of their uniform.
- Clothing enables coordination. Jackets infuse a sense of loyalty, inclusion, and pride amongst the chefs, between them and the rest of the restaurant staff.
- Touch as communication: touch predicts both individual and team performance.
- Choral singing: a lot of benefits. Calms heart rates and boosts endorphin levels. Improves lung function. Increases pain thresholds and reduces the need for pain medication.
- Group dancing, crew team, anything done in a group creates elevated pain thresholds.
- Dabbawala creed: "work is worship" and "customer is god."
- A common mission helps them coordinate. People who do things together were more likely to later help their peers. Operating in sync expands our openness to outsiders and make us more likely to engage in pro-social behavior.

## SEVEN WAYS TO FIND YOUR OWN HIGH

- ***Coordinating and synchronizing with other people is a powerful way to lift your physical and psychological well-being.***

- Sing in a chorus.
- Run together.
- Row crew.
- Dance.
- Join a yoga class.
- Flash mob.
- Cook in tandem.
- Questions to ask:
  - Do we have a clear boss—whether a person or some external standard—who engenders respect, whose role is unambiguous, and to whom everyone can direct their initial focus?
  - Are we fostering a sense of belonging that enriches individual identity, deepens affiliation, and allows everyone to synchronize to the tribe?
  - Are we activating the uplift—feeling good and doing good—that is necessary for a group to succeed?

## FOUR TECHNIQUES FOR PROMOTING BELONGING IN YOUR GROUP

- ***Reply quickly to e-mail. E-mail response time is the single best predictor of whether employees are satisfied with their boss, according to research by Duncan Watts, a Columbia University sociologist who is now a principal researcher for Microsoft Research.***
- ***Tell stories about struggle. One way that groups cohere is through storytelling. But the stories your group tells should not only be tales of triumph. Stories of failure and vulnerability also foster a sense of belongingness.***
- ***Nurture self-organized group rituals.***

# 7. THINKING IN TENSES

- Even in a five-word sentence, "time" can function as a noun, an adjective, or a verb. It is one of the most expansive and versatile words we have.
  - "Time" can be a proper noun, as in "Greenwich Mean Time."
  - The noun form can also signify a discrete duration ("How much time is left in the second period?"), a specific moment ("What time does the bus to Narita arrive?"), an abstract notion ("Where did the time go?"), a general experience ("I'm having a good time"), a turn at doing something ("He rode the roller coaster only one time"), a historical period ("In Winston Churchill's time"), and more.
  - ***In fact, according to Oxford University Press researchers, "time" is the most common noun in the English language.***
- As a verb, it also has multiple meanings.
  - We can time a race, which always involves a clock, or time an attack, which often does not.
  - We can time, as in keeping time, when playing a musical instrument.
  - And we, like dabbawalas and rowers, can time our actions with others.
  - The word can function as an adjective, as in "time bomb," "time zone," and "time clock"—and "adverbs of time" represent an entire category of that part of speech.
- ***But time pervades our language and colors our thought even more deeply. Most of the world's languages mark verbs with time using tenses—especially past, present, and future—to convey meaning and reveal thinking.***

- It's something we're told not to dwell on, but research makes it clear that thinking in the past tense can lead to a greater understanding of ourselves.
  - Nostalgia was  once considered a pathology, an impairment that diverted us from current goals.
  - Benefits of nostalgia: a sense of meaning and a connection to others. When we think nostalgically, we often feature ourselves as the protagonist of a momentous event that involves the people we care about most deeply.
  - Weak-future languages: more likely to save for retirement.
  - If you show yourself age-advanced images of yourself, it can boost your propensity to save.
- Awe: Vastness (the experience of something larger than ourselves) and accommodation (the vastness forces us to adjust our mental structures).
  - When we experience awe, time slows down. And that sensation lifts our well-being.
  - "Experiences of awe bring people into the present moment, and being in the present moment underlies awe's capacity to adjust time perception, influence decisions, and make life feel more satisfying than it would otherwise."
- ***Taken together, all of these studies suggest that the path to a life of meaning and significance isn't to "live in the present" as so many spiritual gurus have advised. It is to integrate our perspectives on time into a coherent whole, one that helps us comprehend who we are and why we're here.***
- *We, too, are way beyond tenses. The challenge of the human condition is to bring the past, present, and future together.*
