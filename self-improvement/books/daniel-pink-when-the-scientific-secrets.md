# 1. THE HIDDEN PATTERN OF EVERYDAY LIFE

- 500 million tweets, 2.4 million users, 84 countries.
  - Tweeters rose in the morning, plummeted in the afternoon, and climbed back up in the early evening. Each weekday was the same. Positive affect was higher on the weekends, but it mainly stayed the same.
  - Peak, trough, and rebound.
  - Suprachiasmatic nucleus: controls the rise and fall of our body temperature, regulates the hormones, and helps us fall asleep at night and awaken in the morning.
  - Human beings "open" and "close" at regular times during the day. Different times for everyone, but same contour.
- People often use social media to present and ideal face to the world that might mask their true, and less ideal, emotions.
  - Day reconstruction method: reconstruct the previous day and tell how they felt while doing it. People are least happy while commuting and most happy while canoodling.
- Earnings calls in the morning: upbeat and positive. As the day progresses: the tone grows more negative. Lunchtime: mood rebounds slightly.
  - Afternoon calls: more negative, irritable, and combative.
  - Same for stereotypes. Mental keenness was greater early in the day. Mental squishiness increased as the day wore on.
- Conclusions:
  - We are smarter/faster/more creative in some parts of the day than others.
  - These fluctuations are more extreme than we realize. Almost the same as the effect between normal and drinking and the legal limit of alcohol.
  - The best time to perform a task depends on the nature of that task.
  - Logical thinking: mornings.
  - Insight problems: more likely to get solved in the afternoon. Flash of illuminance: afternoon.

- Chronotype: a personal pattern of circadian rhythms that influences our physiology and psychology.
  - Genetics, age: children are larks, and super old people are larks. College-aged people are disproportionately owls. 20-25% of the population are solid evening types.
- Owls: More open and extroverted. More neurotic, impulsive, hedonists. But greater creativity, working memory, intelligence scores, sense of humor.
- People are less likely to lie and cheat on tasks in the morning that later in the day.
- Equally important, no matter whether you spend your days making cars or teaching children, beware of that middle period. The trough, as we're about to learn, is more dangerous than most of us realize.

## WHAT TO DO IF YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE

1. *Be aware.* As an owl, prepare everything for the meeting the night before. Before you sit down at the conference table, go for a quick walk outside—ten minutes or so. Or do a small good deed for a colleague—buy him a coffee or help him carry some boxes—which will boost your mood.
2. *Work the margins.* Spend the important time doing your important work. "I get the most done during the so-and-so."
- Exercise in the morning to:
  - Lose weight/fasted training.
  - Boost mood.
  - Keep to your routine.
  - Build strength.
- Exercise in the late afternoon or evening to:
  - Avoid injury: When our muscles are warm, they're more elastic and less prone to injury.
  - Perform your best: Lung function is highest this time of the day, so your circulation system can distribute more oxygen and nutrients. This is also the time of day when strength peaks, reaction time quickens, hand-eye coordination sharpens, and heart rate and blood pressure drop.
  - *In fact, a disproportionate number of Olympic records, especially in running and swimming, are set in the late afternoon and early evening.*
  - Enjoy the workout a bit more: People typically perceive that they're exerting themselves a little less in the afternoon even if they're doing exactly the same exercise routine as in the morning.

## FOUR TIPS FOR A BETTER MORNING

- *Drink a glass of water when you wake up.*
- *Don't drink coffee immediately after you wake up.*
- Soak up the morning sun.
- Schedule talk-therapy appointments for the morning. Cortisol, stress hormone, and it enhances learning.


# 2. AFTERNOONS AND COFFEE SPOONS

- Afternoons suck for hospitals. Expect a decline in vigilance.
- When the Danish students had breaks to eat, play, and chat, their scores did not decline (for afternoon things).

- What should breaks look like?
  - *Something beats nothing.* Short breaks from a task can prevent habituation, help us maintain focus, and reactivate our commitment to a goal. Frequent short breaks are more effective than occasional ones.
  - *Moving beats stationary.* Sitting is bad. Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday can be potent. These hourly five-minute walking breaks boosted energy levels, sharpened focus, and reduced feelings of fatigue in the late afternoon.
  - *Social beats solo.* In high-stress occupations like nursing, social and collective rest breaks not only minimize physical strain and cut down on medical errors, they also reduce turnover; nurses who take these sorts of breaks are more likely to stay at their jobs.
  - *Outside beats inside.* Being close to nature. Seeing plants.
  - *Fully detached beats semidetached.*

## THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY

- Should we all eat breakfast? The conventional view is a flaky and delicious yes. But as a leading British nutritionist and statistician says, “[T]he current state of scientific evidence means that, unfortunately, the simple answer is: I don't know.”33
- Non–desk lunchers were better able to contend with workplace stress and showed less exhaustion and greater vigor not just during the remainder of the day but also a full one year later.

## SLEEPING ON THE JOB

- Naps: improve cognitive performance and boost mental/physical health.
- Pilots who napped show a 34% improvement in reaction time and twofold increase in alertness.
- Ideal naps: 10-20 minutes.

## HOW TO TAKE A PERFECT NAP

- *Find your afternoon trough time.*
- *Create a peaceful environment.*
- *Down a cup of coffee.*
- *Set a timer on your phone for twenty-five minutes.*
- *Repeat consistently.* There's some evidence that habitual nappers get more from their naps than infrequent nappers.

## PAUSE LIKE A PRO

-* Most expert musicians and athletes begin practicing in earnest around nine o'clock in the morning, hit their peak during the late morning, break in the afternoon, and then practice for a few more hours in the evening.*

# 3. BEGINNINGS

- Bad case for teenagers starting the day too early.
- For teenagers, beginning the school day before 8:30 a.m. can impair their health and hobble their grades, which, in turn, can limit their options and alter the trajectory of their lives.
  - For somewhat older people, beginning a career in a weak economy can restrict opportunities and reduce earning power well into adulthood.
  - Beginnings have a far greater impact than most of us understand. Beginnings, in fact, can matter to the end.
- Young people begin undergoing the most profound change in chronobiology of their lifetimes around puberty.
  - They fall asleep later in the evening and, left to their own biological imperatives, wake up later in the morning—a period of peak owliness that stretches into their early twenties.
  - Yet most secondary schools around the world force these extreme owls into schedules designed for chirpy seven-year-old larks.
  - “Adolescents who get less sleep than they need are at higher risk for depression, suicide, substance abuse and car crashes,” according to the journal Pediatrics.

## STARTING AGAIN

- *The first day of the year is what social scientists call a “temporal landmark.*
  - Certain dates function like that Shell station. They stand out from the ceaseless and forgettable march of other days, and their prominence helps us find our way.
  - Gym visits increase at the start of each new week, month, and year.
  - Social landmarks and personal landmarks. These allow people to open "new mental accounts".
  - ***"Temporal landmarks interrupt attention to day-to-day minutiae, causing people to take a big picture view of their lives and thus focus on achieving their goals."***
- *Imbuing an otherwise ordinary day with personal meaning generates the power to activate new beginnings.*
- *Those who entered the job market in weak economies earned less at the beginning of their careers than those who started in strong economies—no big surprise. But this early disadvantage didn't fade. It persisted for as long as twenty years.*
- Getting higher pay earlier in a career: switch jobs fairly often.
- Research on Stanford MBAs has found that the state of the stock market at the time of graduation shapes these graduates' lifetime earnings.
  -  First, students are more likely to take jobs on Wall Street when they graduate in a bull market. By contrast, in bear markets, a sizable portion of graduates choose alternatives—consulting, entrepreneurship, or working for nonprofits.
  - Second, people who work on Wall Street tend to remain working on Wall Street.
  - Third, investment bankers and other financial professionals generally out-earn those in other fields.
- This is a tough problem. If what you earn today depends heavily on the unemployment rate when you started working rather than on the unemployment rate now, the previous two strategies in this chapter—starting right and starting again—are insufficient.

## AVOID A FALSE START WITH A PREMORTEM

- The best way to recover from a false start is to avoid one in the first place. And the best technique for doing that is something called a “premortem.”
  - Before the project begins, convene for a premortem. “Assume it's eighteen months from now and our project is a complete disaster,” you say to your team. “What went wrong?” The team, using the power of prospective hindsight, offers some answers.
  - Maybe the task wasn't clearly defined. Maybe you had too few people, too many people, or the wrong people. Maybe you didn't have a clear leader or realistic objectives. By imagining failure in advance—by thinking through what might cause a false start—you can anticipate some of the potential problems and avoid them once the actual project begins.
  - I projected two years from the start date and imagined that I'd written a terrible book or, worse, hadn't managed to write a book at all. Where did I go awry? ***After looking at my answers, I realized I had to be vigilant about writing every day, saying no to every outside obligation so I didn't get distracted, keeping my editor informed of my progress (or lack thereof), and enlisting his help early in untangling any conceptual knots.***
  - Then I wrote down the positive versions of these insights—for example, “I worked on the book all morning every morning at least six days a week with no distractions and no exceptions”—on a card that I posted near my desk.

## WHEN SHOULD YOU GO FIRST?

- Ballot.
- If you're not the default choice.
- Few competitors.
- Job interviews vs strong candidates.

## Four Situations When You Should Not Go First

- Default choice. Judges are more likely to stick with the default late in the day.
- Many competitors.
- Operating in an uncertain environment.
- If your competition is weak: going last highlights your differences.

## FOUR TIPS FOR MAKING A FAST START IN A NEW JOB

- ***Begin before you begin.*** Pick a specific day and time when you visualize yourself “transforming” into your new role.
  - *By mentally picturing yourself “becoming” a new person even before you enter the front door, you'll hit the carpet running.*
- ***Let your results do the talking.***
  - Concentrate on accomplishing a few meaningful achievements, and once you've gained status by demonstrating excellence, feel free to be more assertive.
- ***Stockpile your motivation.***
- ***Sustain your morale with small wins.***

### WHEN SHOULD YOU GET MARRIED?

- ***Wait until you're old enough (but not too old).***
- ***Wait until you've completed your education.***
- ***Wait until your relationship matures.***

# 4. MIDPOINTS

- Midpoints can bring us down. That's the slump. But they can also fire us up. That's the spark.
- Mid-life phase central feature: the inevitability of one's own eventual personal death.
- Mild slump in the middle of life?
  - One possibility is the disappointment of unrealized expectations.
  - In the middle, we relax our standards. Ex: cutting cards.
- As you approach the midway of something, you can have an "uh-oh" effect. You can make significant progress in a "concentrated midpoint burst".
