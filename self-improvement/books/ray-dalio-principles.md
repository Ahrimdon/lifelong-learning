## Ray Dalio -- Principles

### Introduction

- Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.
- To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained.
- What principles govern you as a person?
- To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained.

### Having Your Own Principles

- If you can think for yourself while being open-minded in a clearheaded way to find out what is best for you to do, and if you can summon up the courage to do it, you will make the most of your life.
- **First principle: Think for yourself to decide what you want, what is true, and what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you.**
- **Being clear on your principles is important because they will affect all aspects of your life, many times a day.**
  - People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts.
  - Are your values and principles clear?
- Your principles can be anything as long as they are authentic. The worst thing you can be is a phony, because if you're a phony you will lose people's trust and your own self-respect.

### My Principles and How I Learned Them

- **I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. By failing well, I mean being able to experience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game.**
- Entrepreneurship: you have to correctly bet against the consensus, which means being wrong a fair amount.
- **Make believability-weighted decisions.** How do you know you're right?
- **Operate by principles so clearly laid out that their logic can easily be assessed and you and others can see if you walk the talk.** It is invaluable to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision!
- **Systematize your decision making.** When developing your own principles, you write them down, especially if you're working with others.

### Autobiography

- My weakness: bad rote memory. But I liked figuring out things for myself. I really didn't get what doing well in school would get me.
- Meditation!
- It's senseless to have making money as your goals as money has no intrinsic value, it's value comes from what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them. You need it, but it's not the only one and certainly not the most important one.
- For me, meaningful work and meaningful relationships, because there is no amount of money I would take in exchange fora meaningful relationship, because there is nothing I could buy with that money that would be more valuable.
- He sort of made the Chicken McNugget happen?
- To be right:
  - Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning.
  - Know when not to have an opinion.
  - Develop, test, and systematize timeless and universal principles.
  - Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.
- Bridgewater: Not an autocracy, but an idea meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their merits.
- Successful people have big painful failures. Gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success.
- Decision-making systems really helped them.
- Highlighted: Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside.
- **Bridgewater: If something went badly, you had to put it in the log, characterize its severity, and make clear who was responsible for it. If a mistake happened and you logged it, you were okay. If you didn't log it, you would be in big trouble.**
- He had this problem: to be radically truthful to bring out the problems and weaknesses, or to have happy and satisfied employees? When faced with the choice between two things that are seemingly at odds, go slowly to figure out how you can have as much of both as possible.

- **Work Principles:**
  - Put our honest thoughts on the table.
  - Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn.
  - Have agreed-upon ways of deciding if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments.
- Upper-level logical and the lower-level emotional brain. How that conflict is managed is the most important driver of our behaviors. **While the logical part of people's brains could easily understand that knowing one's weaknesses is a good thing, the emotional part typically hates it.**
- Early on, being radically transparent was easy, but as they grew, it became logistically impossible.
- Without transparency, people would spin whatever happened to suit their own interests.
- All meetings became taped, and these tapes became case studies that can be used for training.
- Managed who do not understand people's different thinking styles cannot understand how the people working for them will handle different situations.
- Successes:
  - Orchestrate others to do well without you.
  - Doing things well yourself.
  - Doing things poorly yourself.
- On people:
  - Rather than embracing ambiguous situations and difficult challenges, they tended to get uncomfortable when facing them. It is the rare bird who has the right mix of common sense, creativity, and character to shape change.
  - While we agree on the principles intellectually, many struggled to convert what they had agreed to into effective action.
  - We need people with high standards who wouldn't hesitate to eliminate people who couldn't cut it.

- Shapers: Someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts and opposition of others. Jobs, Musk, Bezos.
  - **They are all independent thinkers who do not let anything or anyone stand in the way of achieving their audacious goals. They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at a same time a willingness to test those maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better. They are extremely resilient, because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it. Perhaps interesting, they have a wider range of vision than most people, either because they have that vision themselves or because they know how to get it from others who can see what they can't.All are able to see both big pictures and granular details and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels. They are simultaneously creative, systematic, and practical. They are assertive and open-minded at the same time. Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren't excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world.**
  - Elon Musk on how he got started in rocketry: "I just started reading books."
  - Low on "concern for others". When faced with a goal between achieving their goal or pleasing others, they would choose achieving their goal every time.
- Breakthrough: How about making management decisions based on a computer. The systems didn't have personal biases and emotional barriers to overcome. While we have principles, we don't have decision-making systems.
- "A hero is someone who found or achieved something beyond the normal range of achievement, and who has given his life to something bigger than himself or other than himself."
- Looking back:
  - Reality as a perpetual motion machine, in which causes become effects that become causes of new effects, and so on.
  - My encounters were tests of my character and creativity.
  - In gaining this perspective, I began to experience painful moments in a radically different way: instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw pain as nature's reminder that there is something important for me to learn. Encountering pains and figuring out the lessons they were trying to give me became a game to me.
  - All extraordinary successful people make mistakes, struggle with weaknesses, don't feel they are special or great. They are no happier, they struggle just as much or more than average folks.
  - The satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well. When you achieve things, you know you want to achieve more after.
  - I can't say that having an intense life is better than having a relaxed life, but I can say that being strong is better than being weak.

### Principles

- **Look to the patterns of those things that affect you in order to understand the cause-effect relationships that drive them and to learn principles for dealing with them effectively.**
  - Different people in different parts of the world face different challenges, but most of our encounters with reality fall under some category, and the number of those categories is not enormous.
  - If you write down the total number of encounters, it would probably just be a few hundred items and only a few of them would be unique to you.

### Life Principles

#### Embrace Reality and Deal with It

- It is helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve.
- By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle, and collecting these gems improves my decision making.
- Learning how reality works, visualizing the things I want to create, and then building them out is exciting.
- Stretching for big goals puts me in the position of failing and needing to learn and come up with new inventions.
- Do not focus on the pain of mistake making, focus on the pleasure of pushing through those mistakes.
- **Be a hyperrealist.**
  - I despise impractical idealism.
  - People who create great things aren't idle dreamers: they are totally grounded in reality. Being hyperrealistic will help you choose your dreams wisely and then achieve them.
  - **Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life.**
    - People who achieve success and drive progress understand the cause-effect relationships that govern reality and have principles for using them to get what they want.
    - Successful lives: it really doesn't matter if you want to be a master of the universe or a couch potato. Neither is better. Each of us needs to decide what we value most and choose the paths we take to achieve it.
    - Savor life, or make an impact?
    - Getting more out of life isn't just a matter of working harder, but it's of working effectively.

- **Truth, or an accurate understanding of reality, is the essential foundation for any good outcome.** Most people fight seeing what's true when it's not what they want it to be. That's bad, because it's more important to understand and deal with the bad stuff since the good stuff will take care of itself.

- **Be radically open-minded and radically transparent.**
  - **Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change.** The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive yourself, and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feedback. If you don't put yourself out there with your radical transparency, you won't learn.
  - **Don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.**
    - This is uncomfortable, because I will attract attention and criticism, but I'm doing it because I've learned that it's best, and I wouldn't feel good about myself if I let my fears stand in the way.
    - 18 months?
- **Look to nature to learn how reality works.**
  - The brain's evolution gave us the ability to reflect on how reality works in this way. Man alone can go above its instinct.
  - In contrast with animals, most people struggle to reconcile their emotions/instincts with their reasoning. This struggle causes people to confuse what they want to be true with what actually is true.
  - Ex: studying, you can either do top down (a law that drives a subject, like supply/demand) or bottom up (studying cases and laws that apply to them).
  - We have some "animal" parts that are much older in evolutionary terms than humanity is. These laws that we have in common are the most overarching ones. You can't just study man to understand the universal laws. You can look at things from nature's perspective.
  - **Don't get hung up on your views on how things should be, because you will miss out on learning how they really are.** It's important not to let our biases stand in the way of our objectivity. To get good results, we need to be analytical, rather than emotional.
  - **Whenever I observe something in nature that I think is wrong, I assume that I'm wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense.** Ex: hyenas killing a wildebeest, is this bad? Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual (some ecosystem shit), but MOST PEOPLE JUDGE GOOD AND BAD BASED ON HOW IT AFFECTS THEM. Most people call something bad IF IT IS BAD FOR THEM or those who empathize with. Same with religions, conflicting beliefs. Nature optimizes for good as what's good for the whole.
  - **To be "good" something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is more rewarded.** If you come up with something the world values, YOU WILL BE REWARDED. Reality tends to penalize those people, species, and things that don't work well and detract from evolution.
  - **Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything.** Other than life, knowledge is like DNA in that it is passed from generation to generation.
  - Evolution: sometimes has a painful decline, which leads to new adaptations. There are a lot of once-great things that deteriorated and failed. And so, perfection doesn't exist. If nature was perfect, then it wouldn't be evolving.
  - **So, evolve or die.** Everything naturally self-corrects, though not necessarily for its parts.

- **Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward.**
  - We instinctively want to get better at things and have created and evolved technology to help us. Species will either go extinct or evolve into other species.
    - The individual's incentives must be aligned with the group's goals.
    - Reality optimizes for the whole, not for you. Contribute to the whole and you will likely be rewarded.
    - Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable. Think of how man has a hard time fighting against viruses. Viruses don't even have brains. They adapt very quickly (combining different genetic material across different strains).
    - Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothing, and decide what you want to be. We are of absolutely no significance to the universe.
    - What you will be will depend on the perspective you have. You decide on how you see things, who you feel connected to (Your family? Your country? Mankind?) and you decide to which extent you put the interests of others above your own, and WHICH others you will choose to do so for.

- **Understand nature's practical lessons.**
  - Most things that seem "bad" (rainy days, weaknesses, death) was because I held pre-conceived notions on what I personally wanted.
  - Maximize our evolution. For most people, things (toys, houses, money, status) don't supply anything near the long-term satisfaction that getting better at something does. Once we get the things we are striving for, we remain satisfied with them. For most people, success is struggling and evolving as effectively as possible, and then changing to improve.
  - Compare having a lot of money with being intellectually healthy. I believe that the need to have meaningful work is connected to man's innate desire to improve.
  - **No pain, no gain.** Realizing that the stuff we are after won't sustain our happiness helps me focus on my goals of evolving and contributing to evolution. The purpose of pain: it alerts and helps direct us.
  - **It is a fundamental law that in order to gain strength, one has to push one's limits, which is painful.** Man needs difficulties. They are necessary for health. Body (weight lifting) or mind (frustration, mental struggle, embarrassment, shame).

- **Pain + Reflection = Progress.**
  - If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving.
  - After seeing how much effective it is to face the painful realities that are cause by your problems, mistakes, and weaknesses, I believe you won't want it to operate any other way.
  - The challenges you face will test and strengthen you. If you're not failing, you're not pushing your limits, and if you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential.
  - GO TO PAIN. If you don't let up on yourself and instead become comfortable always operating with some level of pain, you will evolve at a faster pace. That's just the way it is.
  - You will become hooked on:
    - Identifying, accepting, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses.
    - Preferring that the people around you be honest with you rather than keep their negative thoughts about you to themselves.
    - Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong where you are weak.
  - **Embrace tough love.** Sometimes, better to deny people what they want so that they have the opportunity to struggle so that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own.
  - This is difficult for people EMOTIONALLY. Even if they understand it intellectually.
  - Recognize that everyone has weaknesses, and that bringing them to the surface will help you break your bad habits and develop goods ones, and you will acquire real strengths and justifiable optimism.
  - The quality of your life depends on the choices you make after those painful moments. The faster one appropriately adapts, the better.
- **Weight second- and third-order consequences.**
  - First-order consequence for exercise: pain/time spent. Second-order: better health and more attractive appearance.
  - Food that tastes good is often bad for you.
  - People who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.

- **Own your outcomes.**
  - Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being beyond your control.
  - Life doesn't give a damn about what you like.

- **Look at the machine from the higher level.**
  - Higher-level thinking: The ability to rise above your own and others' circumstances and objectively look down on them.
  - **Think of yourself as a machine operating within a machine and you know that you have the ability to alter your machines to produce better outcomes.** You need the right design and the right skills to put yourself in positions to succeed.
  - **By comparing your outcomes with your goals, you can determine how to modify your machine.**
  - **Distinguish between you as the designer of the machine and you as the worker with your machine.** "Manager you" needs to be objective with "worker you".
  - **The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively, which leads them to bump into their own and others' weaknesses again and again.** You shouldn't be upset if you find out that you're bad at something--at least you know that you can improve it now.
  - **Watching people struggle/watching yourself struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that and stop seeing struggling as something negative.** Most of life's greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle, it's up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.
  - **Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is important!**
  - **You have to rely on the input of others and the whole body of evidence (this is correct feedback).**
  - **If you are open-minded and determined, you can get virtually anything you want.** Reflect on if things you are going for are consistent with your nature.
- **On confronting your weaknesses:**
  - Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.
  - Don't worry about looking good--worry instead about achieving your goals.
  - Don't overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third- order ones.
  - Don't let pain stand in the way of progress.
  - Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.
