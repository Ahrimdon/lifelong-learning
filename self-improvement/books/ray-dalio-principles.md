## Ray Dalio -- Principles

### Introduction

- Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.
- To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained.
- What principles govern you as a person?

### Having Your Own Principles

- If you can think for yourself while being open-minded in a clearheaded way to find out what is best for you to do, and if you can summon up the courage to do it, you will make the most of your life.
- ***First principle: Think for yourself to decide what you want, what is true, and what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you.***
- ***Being clear on your principles is important because they will affect all aspects of your life, many times a day.***
  - People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts.
  - Are your values and principles clear?
- Your principles can be anything as long as they are authentic. The worst thing you can be is a phony, because if you're a phony you will lose people's trust and your own self-respect.

### My Principles and How I Learned Them

- ***I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. By failing well, I mean being able to experience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game.***
- Entrepreneurship: you have to correctly bet against the consensus, which means being wrong a fair amount.
- ***Make believability-weighted decisions.*** How do you know you're right?
- ***Operate by principles so clearly laid out that their logic can easily be assessed and you and others can see if you walk the talk.*** It is invaluable to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision!
- ***Systematize your decision making.*** When developing your own principles, you write them down, especially if you're working with others.

### Autobiography

- My weakness: bad rote memory. But I liked figuring out things for myself. I really didn't get what doing well in school would get me.
- Meditation!
- *It's senseless to have making money as your goals as money has no intrinsic value, it's value comes from what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them.* You need it, but it's not the only one and certainly not the most important one.
- For me, meaningful work and meaningful relationships, because there is no amount of money I would take in exchange fora meaningful relationship, because there is nothing I could buy with that money that would be more valuable.
- He sort of made the Chicken McNugget happen?
- To be right:
  - Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning.
  - Know when not to have an opinion.
  - Develop, test, and systematize timeless and universal principles.
  - Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.
- Bridgewater: Not an autocracy, but an idea meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their merits.
- Successful people have big painful failures. Gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success.
- Decision-making systems really helped them.
- Highlighted: Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside.
- ***Bridgewater: If something went badly, you had to put it in the log, characterize its severity, and make clear who was responsible for it. If a mistake happened and you logged it, you were okay. If you didn't log it, you would be in big trouble.***
- He had this problem: to be radically truthful to bring out the problems and weaknesses, or to have happy and satisfied employees? When faced with the choice between two things that are seemingly at odds, go slowly to figure out how you can have as much of both as possible.

- ***Work Principles:***
  - Put our honest thoughts on the table.
  - Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn.
  - Have agreed-upon ways of deciding if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments.
- Upper-level logical and the lower-level emotional brain. How that conflict is managed is the most important driver of our behaviors. ***While the logical part of people's brains could easily understand that knowing one's weaknesses is a good thing, the emotional part typically hates it.***
- Early on, being radically transparent was easy, but as they grew, it became logistically impossible.
- Without transparency, people would spin whatever happened to suit their own interests.
- All meetings became taped, and these tapes became case studies that can be used for training.
- Managed who do not understand people's different thinking styles cannot understand how the people working for them will handle different situations.
- Successes:
  - Orchestrate others to do well without you.
  - Doing things well yourself.
  - Doing things poorly yourself.
- On people:
  - Rather than embracing ambiguous situations and difficult challenges, they tended to get uncomfortable when facing them. It is the rare bird who has the right mix of common sense, creativity, and character to shape change.
  - While we agree on the principles intellectually, many struggled to convert what they had agreed to into effective action.
  - We need people with high standards who wouldn't hesitate to eliminate people who couldn't cut it.

- Shapers: Someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts and opposition of others. Jobs, Musk, Bezos.
  - ***They are all independent thinkers who do not let anything or anyone stand in the way of achieving their audacious goals. They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at a same time a willingness to test those maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better. They are extremely resilient, because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it. Perhaps interesting, they have a wider range of vision than most people, either because they have that vision themselves or because they know how to get it from others who can see what they can't.All are able to see both big pictures and granular details and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels. They are simultaneously creative, systematic, and practical. They are assertive and open-minded at the same time. Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren't excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world.***
  - Elon Musk on how he got started in rocketry: "I just started reading books."
  - Low on "concern for others". When faced with a goal between achieving their goal or pleasing others, they would choose achieving their goal every time.
- Breakthrough: How about making management decisions based on a computer. The systems didn't have personal biases and emotional barriers to overcome. While we have principles, we don't have decision-making systems.
- "A hero is someone who found or achieved something beyond the normal range of achievement, and who has given his life to something bigger than himself or other than himself."
- Looking back:
  - Reality as a perpetual motion machine, in which causes become effects that become causes of new effects, and so on.
  - My encounters were tests of my character and creativity.
  - In gaining this perspective, I began to experience painful moments in a radically different way: instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw pain as nature's reminder that there is something important for me to learn. Encountering pains and figuring out the lessons they were trying to give me became a game to me.
  - All extraordinary successful people make mistakes, struggle with weaknesses, don't feel they are special or great. They are no happier, they struggle just as much or more than average folks.
  - The satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well. When you achieve things, you know you want to achieve more after.
  - I can't say that having an intense life is better than having a relaxed life, but I can say that being strong is better than being weak.

### Principles

- ***Look to the patterns of those things that affect you in order to understand the cause-effect relationships that drive them and to learn principles for dealing with them effectively.***
  - Different people in different parts of the world face different challenges, but most of our encounters with reality fall under some category, and the number of those categories is not enormous.
  - If you write down the total number of encounters, it would probably just be a few hundred items and only a few of them would be unique to you.

### Life Principles

#### Embrace Reality and Deal with It

- It is helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve.
- By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle, and collecting these gems improves my decision making.
- Learning how reality works, visualizing the things I want to create, and then building them out is exciting.
- Stretching for big goals puts me in the position of failing and needing to learn and come up with new inventions.
- Do not focus on the pain of mistake making, focus on the pleasure of pushing through those mistakes.
- ***Be a hyperrealist.***
  - I despise impractical idealism.
  - People who create great things aren't idle dreamers: they are totally grounded in reality. Being hyperrealistic will help you choose your dreams wisely and then achieve them.
  - ***Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life.***
    - People who achieve success and drive progress understand the cause-effect relationships that govern reality and have principles for using them to get what they want.
    - Successful lives: it really doesn't matter if you want to be a master of the universe or a couch potato. Neither is better. Each of us needs to decide what we value most and choose the paths we take to achieve it.
    - Savor life, or make an impact?
    - Getting more out of life isn't just a matter of working harder, but it's of working effectively.

- ***Truth, or an accurate understanding of reality, is the essential foundation for any good outcome.*** Most people fight seeing what's true when it's not what they want it to be. That's bad, because it's more important to understand and deal with the bad stuff since the good stuff will take care of itself.

- ***Be radically open-minded and radically transparent.***
  - ***Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change.*** The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive yourself, and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feedback. If you don't put yourself out there with your radical transparency, you won't learn.
  - ***Don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.***
    - This is uncomfortable, because I will attract attention and criticism, but I'm doing it because I've learned that it's best, and I wouldn't feel good about myself if I let my fears stand in the way.
    - 18 months?
- ***Look to nature to learn how reality works.***
  - The brain's evolution gave us the ability to reflect on how reality works in this way. Man alone can go above its instinct.
  - In contrast with animals, most people struggle to reconcile their emotions/instincts with their reasoning. This struggle causes people to confuse what they want to be true with what actually is true.
  - Ex: studying, you can either do top down (a law that drives a subject, like supply/demand) or bottom up (studying cases and laws that apply to them).
  - We have some "animal" parts that are much older in evolutionary terms than humanity is. These laws that we have in common are the most overarching ones. You can't just study man to understand the universal laws. You can look at things from nature's perspective.
  - ***Don't get hung up on your views on how things should be, because you will miss out on learning how they really are.*** It's important not to let our biases stand in the way of our objectivity. To get good results, we need to be analytical, rather than emotional.
  - ***Whenever I observe something in nature that I think is wrong, I assume that I'm wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense.*** Ex: hyenas killing a wildebeest, is this bad? Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual (some ecosystem shit), but MOST PEOPLE JUDGE GOOD AND BAD BASED ON HOW IT AFFECTS THEM. Most people call something bad IF IT IS BAD FOR THEM or those who empathize with. Same with religions, conflicting beliefs. Nature optimizes for good as what's good for the whole.
  - ***To be "good" something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is more rewarded.*** If you come up with something the world values, YOU WILL BE REWARDED. Reality tends to penalize those people, species, and things that don't work well and detract from evolution.
  - ***Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything.*** Other than life, knowledge is like DNA in that it is passed from generation to generation.
  - Evolution: sometimes has a painful decline, which leads to new adaptations. There are a lot of once-great things that deteriorated and failed. And so, perfection doesn't exist. If nature was perfect, then it wouldn't be evolving.
  - ***So, evolve or die.*** Everything naturally self-corrects, though not necessarily for its parts.

- ***Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward.***
  - We instinctively want to get better at things and have created and evolved technology to help us. Species will either go extinct or evolve into other species.
    - The individual's incentives must be aligned with the group's goals.
    - Reality optimizes for the whole, not for you. Contribute to the whole and you will likely be rewarded.
    - Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable. Think of how man has a hard time fighting against viruses. Viruses don't even have brains. They adapt very quickly (combining different genetic material across different strains).
    - Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothing, and decide what you want to be. We are of absolutely no significance to the universe.
    - What you will be will depend on the perspective you have. You decide on how you see things, who you feel connected to (Your family? Your country? Mankind?) and you decide to which extent you put the interests of others above your own, and WHICH others you will choose to do so for.

- ***Understand nature's practical lessons.***
  - Most things that seem "bad" (rainy days, weaknesses, death) was because I held pre-conceived notions on what I personally wanted.
  - Maximize our evolution. For most people, things (toys, houses, money, status) don't supply anything near the long-term satisfaction that getting better at something does. Once we get the things we are striving for, we remain satisfied with them. For most people, success is struggling and evolving as effectively as possible, and then changing to improve.
  - Compare having a lot of money with being intellectually healthy. I believe that the need to have meaningful work is connected to man's innate desire to improve.
  - ***No pain, no gain.*** Realizing that the stuff we are after won't sustain our happiness helps me focus on my goals of evolving and contributing to evolution. The purpose of pain: it alerts and helps direct us.
  - ***It is a fundamental law that in order to gain strength, one has to push one's limits, which is painful.*** Man needs difficulties. They are necessary for health. Body (weight lifting) or mind (frustration, mental struggle, embarrassment, shame).

- ***Pain + Reflection = Progress.***
  - If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving.
  - After seeing how much effective it is to face the painful realities that are cause by your problems, mistakes, and weaknesses, I believe you won't want it to operate any other way.
  - The challenges you face will test and strengthen you. If you're not failing, you're not pushing your limits, and if you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential.
  - GO TO PAIN. If you don't let up on yourself and instead become comfortable always operating with some level of pain, you will evolve at a faster pace. That's just the way it is.
  - You will become hooked on:
    - Identifying, accepting, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses.
    - Preferring that the people around you be honest with you rather than keep their negative thoughts about you to themselves.
    - Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong where you are weak.
  - ***Embrace tough love.*** Sometimes, better to deny people what they want so that they have the opportunity to struggle so that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own.
  - This is difficult for people EMOTIONALLY. Even if they understand it intellectually.
  - Recognize that everyone has weaknesses, and that bringing them to the surface will help you break your bad habits and develop goods ones, and you will acquire real strengths and justifiable optimism.
  - The quality of your life depends on the choices you make after those painful moments. The faster one appropriately adapts, the better.
- ***Weight second- and third-order consequences.***
  - First-order consequence for exercise: pain/time spent. Second-order: better health and more attractive appearance.
  - Food that tastes good is often bad for you.
  - People who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.

- ***Own your outcomes.***
  - Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being beyond your control.
  - Life doesn't give a damn about what you like.

- ***Look at the machine from the higher level.***
  - Higher-level thinking: The ability to rise above your own and others' circumstances and objectively look down on them.
  - ***Think of yourself as a machine operating within a machine and you know that you have the ability to alter your machines to produce better outcomes.*** You need the right design and the right skills to put yourself in positions to succeed.
  - ***By comparing your outcomes with your goals, you can determine how to modify your machine.***
  - ***Distinguish between you as the designer of the machine and you as the worker with your machine.*** "Manager you" needs to be objective with "worker you".
  - ***The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively, which leads them to bump into their own and others' weaknesses again and again.*** You shouldn't be upset if you find out that you're bad at something--at least you know that you can improve it now.
  - ***Watching people struggle/watching yourself struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that and stop seeing struggling as something negative.*** Most of life's greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle, it's up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.
  - ***Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is important!***
  - ***You have to rely on the input of others and the whole body of evidence (this is correct feedback).***
  - ***If you are open-minded and determined, you can get virtually anything you want.*** Reflect on if things you are going for are consistent with your nature.
- ***On confronting your weaknesses:***
  - Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.
  - Don't worry about looking good--worry instead about achieving your goals.
  - Don't overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third- order ones.
  - Don't let pain stand in the way of progress.
  - Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.

- Face "harsh realities." vs avoid facing "harsh realities."
- Worry about achieving the goal vs worry about appearing good.
- Make decisions on first-, second-, and third-order consequences.
- Understand how to manage pain to produce progress.
- Hold yourself and others accountable.

#### Use the 5-Step Process to Get What You Want Out of Life

- Have clear goals. Don't even think about how you will achieve them, just set them.
- Identify/don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.
- Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. Don't try to solve them, just diagnose them.
- Design plans that will get you around them.
- Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.
- Again, be ruthlessly honest/don't let your emotions get the best of you. If necessary, seek guidance from calm, thoughtful people.
- Every mistake you make teaches you something, so there's no end to learning. You'll soon realize that excuses like "that's not easy" or "it doesn't seem fair" or "I can't do that" are of NO VALUE and that it pays to push through.

- ***Have clear goals.***
  - Choosing a goal often means rejecting some things you want in order to get other things that you want or need more.
  - Don't confuse goals with desires. Don't think of the first-order consequences like eating junk food. If you want to be a couch potato, it's fine. If you don't, then don't open that bag of chips.
  - ***Don't make the trappings of success for success itself.*** Achievement orientation is important, but people who obsess over a $1200 pair of shoes or a fancy car are very rarely happy because they don't know what it is that they really want and hence what will satisfy them.
  - Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable. You'll be surprised.
  - Flexibility (allows you to accept what reality or knowledgeable people) teaches you, self-accountability (if you really believe that failing to achieve a goal is your personal failure, you will see your failing to achieve it as indicative that you haven't been creative or flexible or determined enough.
  - Knowing how to deal well with setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward. Think of like, making the best possible choices, even if all of them are bad.

- ***Identify and don't tolerate problems.***
  - Painful problems = potential improvements.
  - Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities. GET OVER IT. ***Acknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them.***
  - Be specific in identifying your problems. If you're bad at accounting, hire an accountant. If something results from another person's weaknesses, replace them with someone who is strong where it's needed.
  - Don't mistake the cause of a problem with the real problem. "I can't get enough sleep" is not a problem, it is a potential cause, or the result, of a problem.
  - Distinguish big problems from small ones.
  - Once you identify a problem, don't tolerate it. Tolerating a problem has the same consequences as failing to identify it. You still have this problem!

- ***Diagnose problems to get at their root causes.***
  - ***Distinguish proximate (I got late because I didn't check the schedule) from root (I am forgetful) causes.***
  - ***Knowing what someone is like tells you what you can expect from them.*** People who live up to their potential often have a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively and understand the root causes standing in their way.

- ***Design a plan.***
  - Replay the story of where you have been, then visualize what you must do in the future so you will reach your goals.
  - Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine.
  - Think of your plan as a movie script that you visualize who will do what through time.
  - Write down your plan for everyone to see and measure your progress against. This includes all granular details about who needs to do what tasks and when.
  - Design before doing!

- ***Push through to completion.***
  - Good work habits are vastly underrated. People who push through successfully have to-do lists that are reasonable prioritized.
  - Establish clear metrics to make certain that you are following your plan.
  - These steps proceed from your values. Your values determine what you want, your goals. When you complete one step, you'll acquire information that will most likely lead you to modify the other steps.

#### Be Radically Open-Minded

- ***Recognize your two barriers.***
  - Ego: The subliminal defense mechanisms that make it hard for you to accept your mistakes and weaknesses. Your deepest-seated needs and fears reside in primitive parts of your brain such as the amygdala. Because these areas of your brain are not accessible to your conscious awareness, it is virtually impossible for you to understand what they want and how they control you.
    - The amygdala craves praise and responds to criticism as an attack, even when the higher-level parts of the brain understand the constructive criticism is good for you. They make you defensive, especially when it comes to the subject of how good you are.
    - Your two "yous" fight to control you. You can actually see your brains fight, "why did I let myself eat all the cake" vs "because the lower-level you won out over the thoughtful, higher-level you".
    - Most people don't even know they exist, never mind that they are trying to hijack everyone's behavior.
    - When someone disagrees with you, you might choose to interpret this attack, though it would be more logical for you to be interested in the other person's perspective, especially if they are intelligent. Then when you try to explain yourself, you realize that it doesn't make sense. This is because your lower brain is trying to speak through your upper brain, so there is no logical way to explain what "you" are thinking.
    - If you are too proud of what you know or of how good you are at something, you will learn less, make inferior decisions, and fall short of your potential.
  - Blind spot barrier.
    - We don't like to see ourselves or others as having blind spots, even though we all have them.
    - You have no clue how other people see things and aren't good at seeking to understand what they are thinking, because you're too preoccupied with telling them what you yourself think is correct. In short, you're close-minded, you presume too much.
    - When two parties think they're right, they often end up angry at each other. This is illogical and leads to suboptimal decision making.

- ***Practice radical open-mindedness.***
  - If you know you are blind, you can maybe figure out a way to see, but if you don't, you'll continue to bump into your problems.
  - This is like escaping the lower-level you and ensuring your upper-level you sees and considers all the good choices and makes the best possible decisions.
  - ***Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your ability to deal well with "not knowing" is more important than whatever it is you do know.*** Coming up with the right questions and asking other smart people what they think is as important as having all the answers.
  - ***Recognize that decision making is a two-step process: take in all relevant information, then decide.***
  - Why do people try to prove that they have the answer, even if they don't? They probably believe that great people have all the answers and don't have any weaknesses (wrong).
  - Being open-minded: you need to be so open to the possibility that you could be wrong that you encourage others to tell you so.
- ***Remember, you're looking for the best answer, not simple the best answer that you can come up with yourself.*** Recognize that the probability of you always having the best answer is small.
- Think, which one of you is the more believable one? If both parties are peers, it's appropriate to argue. Believable people = those who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question and have great explanations of their approach when probed.
- You should make it clear that you are asking questions because you are seeking to understand their perspective. If you're clearly the more believable person, you might politely remind the other of that.

- ***Appreciate the art of thoughtful disagreement.***
  - When two people believe opposite things, chances are that one of them is wrong. It pays to find out if that someone is you.
  - In thoughtful disagreement, your goal is not to convince the other party that you are right, it's to find out which view is true and decide what to do about it.
  - You want both "higher-level yous" trying to get to the truth. These are helpful and a giant source of untapped potential.
  - Conduct the discussion in a calm and dispassionate manner, and encourage the other person to do that as well. You are not arguing; you are openly exploring what's true. Be reasonable and expect others to be reasonable.
  - ***It's pointless when people get angry with other when they disagree because most disagreements aren't threats as much as opportunities for learning.*** People who changed their minds because they learned something are the winners, whereas those who stubbornly refuse to learn are the losers. This doesn't mean you should blindly accept others' conclusions, you should be open-minded and assertive at the same time--you should hold and explore conflicting possibilities in your mind while moving toward whatever is likely to be true.
  - Recommended: Have a rule where no one interrupts the other.
  - Working through disagreements does take time but it's about the best way you can spend it. Consider that there are lots of people who will disagree with you, and it would be unproductive to consider all their views. It doesn't pay to be open minded with everyone. Instead, explore ideas with the most believable people you have access to.
  - Most people are instinctively reluctant to disagree. This is your lower-level interpreting disagreement as conflict. This is why it isn't easy, you have to have exchanges that don't trigger such reactions in yourself or others.

- ***Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree.***
  - Smart people who can thoughtfully disagree are the greatest teachers.
  - Even experts can make mistakes. It pays to be radically open-minded and triangulate with smart people.
  - Second opinion? Doctors can make mistakes.

- ***Recognize the signs of closed-mindedness and open-mindedness that you should watch out for.***
  - Close-minded people don't want their ideas challenged. They feel bad about getting something wrong and are more interested in being proven right.
  - Close-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions. Open-minded genuinely believe they could be wrong; the questions they ask are genuine.
  - Close-minded people focus more on being understood than on understanding others.
  - Close-minded people block others from speaking.

- ***Understand how you can become radically open-minded.***
  - Regularly use pain as your guide toward quality reflection. ***Mental pain often comes from being too attached to an idea when a person or an even comes along to challenge it.***
  - You will feel your amygdala kicking in through a tightening in your head, tension in your body, or an emerging sense of annoyance, anger or irritability.
  - Get to know your blind spots: where have you made bad decisions because you failed to see what others saw?
  - If a number of believable people say you are doing something wrong and you are the only one who doesn't see it that way, assume that you are probably biased. You should switch from a fighting mode to an "asking questions" mode.
  - Meditate.
  - Be evidence-based.
  - Do everything in your power to help others also be open-minded. Ask others to point to evidence that supports their point of view.
  - Use evidence-based decision making tools.
- ***Are you willing to fight to find out what's true? Do you deeply believe that finding out what is true is essential to your well-being? Do you have a genuine need to find out if you or others are doing something wrong that is standing in the way of achieving your goals??***

### Understand that People Are Wired Very Differently

- Creative, conceptual people who had a lot of common sense.
- Paul (his son)'s bipolar disorder: due to the brain chemistry secreting serotonin and dopamine in spurts and sputters. It's hard to reason with someone who wasn't thinking well.
- When you understand that it's physiological, things become clearer. People think according to how they see things.
- Ex: a creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue daily details, and task-oriented people might undervalue creativity.
- BW baseball cards: stats for each player in the company.

- ***Meaningful work*** and meaningful relationships are genetically programmed into us.
  - The brain evolved in ways supporting cooperation so man could hunt and do other activities.
  - The Dalai Lama: Prayer and meditation seemed to have similar effects on the brain re: producing feelings of spirituality, each religion adds superstitions to this.

- ***Understand the great brain battles and how to control them to get what you want.***

- The conscious battles the subconscious. The concept of the "two yous". An animal doesn't decide to fly or hunt or sleep in the way that we go about making many of our own choices of what to do--it simply follows the instructions that come from the subconscious parts of its brain.
- Our subconscious fears and desires drive our motivations and actions through emotions such as love, fear, and inspiration. It's physiological.
- The subconscious parts of our brains are dangerously animalistic, others are smarter and quicker than our conscious minds.
- You can't just cram stuff into your conscious mind. While counter-intuitive, you can also clear your head to make progress.
- ***Know that the most constant struggle is between feeling and thinking.***
  - There are no greater battles that our feelings (amygdala) and our rational thinking (prefrontal cortex). When something upsets us, this amygdala prepares to fight or flee. Remember that your conscious mind can refuse to obey these instructions. When you know how these hijackings work, you know that if you allow yourself to react spontaneously, you will be prone to overreact.
- Basal ganglia: Drives your habits. Habits = inertia, the strong tendency to keep doing what you've been doing. Habits put your brain on autopilot.
- ***Train your lower-level you with kindness*** More effective to train that subconscious, emotional you the same way you teach a child.
- Buddhist monks who had practiced more than ten thousand hours of meditation measured significantly higher levels of gamma waves in their brains.
- You may train yourself to be more creative, but if you're not naturally creative, there's likely a limit to what you can do.
- Intuiting (vs sensing: Big picture(forests) vs details (trees).
- Thinking vs feeling. Thinking: logical analysis. Feeling: focus on harmony between people.
- Planning vs perceiving. Planners like to focus on a plan and stick with it, perceivers work from the outside in, they see things happening and work backwards to understand the cause and how to respond.
- Creators vs refiners vs advancers vs executors vs flexors.
  - Creators: unstructured/abstract activities, innovation and unconventional practices.
  - Advancers: feelings, relationships, manage the human factors.
  - Refiners: challenge ideas.
  - Executors: can be thought of as implementers.
  - Flexors: combination.
- Shapers: from visualization to actualization. People who come up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully.
  - Intense curiosity.
  - Compulsive need to make sense of things.
  - Independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness.
  - A need to dream big.
  - Practicality to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals.
  - Knowledge of their own and others' weaknesses.
  - Can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously.
  - Love to knock things around with other smart people.

- ***Getting the right people in the right roles in support of your goal is the key to succeeding at whatever you choose to accomplish.***
  - For you, it's about using your thoughtful higher-level you to manage your emotional lower-level you.
  - ***Consciously develop habits that will make doing the things that are good for you habitual.***
  - Think like this: you are the conductor of your own orchestra. It's your job to remove the people that don't play well with others, and it's your job to make sure that things are executed according to how it's in your head.

### Learn How to Make Decisions Effectively

- Recognize that the biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions, and decision making is a two-step process (learning, then deciding).
- Getting an accurate picture of reality comes down to: being able to synthesize accurately and knowing how to navigate levels.
  - Synthesis: converting a lot of data into an accurate picture. This is why you triangulate your views with people who you know synthesize well.
    - New is overvalued relative to great.
    - People who are good at pulling out such patterns of events are rare and essential.
    - Be imprecise. You don't usually need to say "it's true", you can say "it's probably by-and-large true."
  - Remember the 80/20 rule and know what the key 20% is.
- You can navigate levels to move from your values to realize them on a day-to-day basis.

Ex:

- I want meaningful work.
  - I want to be a doctor.
    - I need to go to medical school.
      - I need to get good grades in the sciences.
        - I need to stay at home tonight and study.

- Pay attention to your conversations.
- Decisions should be consistent across different levels. Ex: healthiness, you shouldn't have twelve sausage links and a beer every day for breakfast.
- Deciding well: logic, reason, common sense. "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." - Carl Jung
- Make your decisions as expected value calculations.
- Always try to raise the probability of being right.
- The best choices are the ones that have more pros than cons.
- ***Prioritize by weighing the value of additional information against the cost of not deciding.***

- ***Shortcuts for Becoming a Great Decision Maker***
  - Simplify. Get rid of irrelevant details, just essential information.
  - Use principles. Most "cases at hand" can be put in categories.
  - Believably weigh your decision making.
  - Try to make a computer help you when making decisions.
- On technology: there might come a point where you can input issues into a computer and have exchanges with experts all around the world.
  - It's far more likely to think that humans will work WITH AI than against them.
  - Computer have much greater "determination" than any other person, and they will work 24/7 for you. They process information faster, and they are immune to biases.
  - Computers have no common sense. It can infer that waking up makes people hungry, just because they are sequential.
- In order to have the best life possible, you have to: know what the best decisions are, and have the courage to make them.

### Putting It All Together

- Embrace reality and deal with it.
- Be transparent with your thoughts and open-mindedly accept the feedback of others.
- Radical open-mindedness.
- Ego barrier and blind spot barrier.
- People are wired differently.
- Go after what you want, failing and reflecting well, changing/evolving to become more capable and less fearful.

- The most important principles for investors are: First, know how to balance your portfolio so that you don’t have any systematic bias toward bull or bear markets in anything.
  - Second, don’t make the mistake of thinking that investments that have been good over the past few years rather than more expensive investments.
  - Think about how to rotate your portfolio to buy that which is cheap and sell that which is expensive.
- Teaching a 20-something year old?
  - *To know how to simultaneously think for yourself and know that you know virtually nothing so that you have to take in the best thinking that’s available to you and critically analyze it.*
- *While the power of a visionary “shaper” is great, it is nowhere near as powerful as the collection of independent-minded shapers who know how to disagree well and then get beyond their disagreements to make the best decisions.* ***In addition, if you don’t have people who can think for themselves, you won’t have great leverage and you won’t build a great organization.*** You also won’t have them devoted to the mission. So I believe an idea meritocracy is so much more powerful than organizations that resemble feudal monarchies.
- *I think it’s really important for children in school to learn that making mistakes is part of the learning process, that everybody has strengths and weaknesses, and I think it’s also important for them to learn how to think creatively for themselves rather than just follow instructions.* I think that the school learning process often fails students in making them learn what the teacher wants them to remember and think that making mistakes is bad and a sign of their inadequacy.
- Whenever I’m in a position in which too many choices are coming at me at once to handle them all well (which is most of the time like it is for most people), it forces me up to the higher level to reflect on my priorities and organize myself to reject good alternatives. If you have my book Principles, there’s one about this idea, Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can’t have everything you want.
- Instincts and intuition are very important. They come from the subliminal mind and are brought to the surface and have to be reconciled with the logical, conscious mind. When the two are aligned, I’m ready to go.
- About 30 years ago I learned that I could take the written principles I’d been recording and put them into equations in the computer that allowed them to think in parallel with me. I believe that you can learn to do this without knowing how to write the algorithms yourself by working with people who know how to convert thoughts into algorithms and I urge you to do this.
- Though the amount of debt is important, even more important is whether or not that debt is denominated in your own currency. That is because if it is denominated in ones own currency, policy makers have numerous ways of spreading it out so that it doesn’t sink the economy. The most important question for those who do have debt denominated in their own currency is whether they have the skill, wisdom, and political system that allows them to manage that well.
