# How to Stop Worrying and Start Living

- Law of averages.
- Being blind - "How wonderful, that science now has the skill to operate on anything so delicate as the human eye!"

```
For every ailment, under the sun.
There is a remedy, or there is none;
If there be one, try to find it;
If there be none, never mind it.
```

- Socrates: "Try to bear lightly what needs must be."
- Marcus Aurelius: "Our life is what our thoughts make it."
- Concerned - realizing what the problems are, and calmly taking steps to meet them. Worrying - means going around in maddening, futile circles.
- The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of Hell, a hell of Heaven.
- "A man is not so hurt as much by what happens, as by his opinion of what happens. And our opinion of what happens is entirely up to us."

## The High Cost of Getting Even

- If selfish people try to take advantage of you, cross them off your list, but don't try to get even. When you try to get even, you hurt yourself more than you hurt the other fellow?
  - The chief personality characteristic of people with hypertension is resentment.
- "Thank God that life has not made us what they are. Instead of heaping condemnation and revenge upon our enemies, let's give them our understanding, our sympathy, our help, our forgiveness, and our prayers."

- It's natural for people to forget to be grateful; so if we go around expecting gratitude, we are headed straight for a lot of heartaches.
- If we want to find happiness, let's stop thinking about gratitude or ingratitude and give for the inner joy of giving.
- "I had the blues because I had no shoes, until upon the street; I met a man who had no feet."
- About 90% of the things in our life are right and about 10% are wrong. If we want to be happy, we have to be concentrate on the 90%.
- The habit of looking on the best side of every event is worth more than a thousand pounds a year.

- "Two men looked out from prison bars, one saw the mud, the other saw stars." Changing attitudes or minds are able to change a wretched experience into the most exciting adventure of my life."
- The best things are the most difficult.
- Suppose we are so discouraged that we feel there is no hope of our ever being able to turn our lemons into lemonade, here are two reasons why we have everything to gain and nothing to lose:
  - We may succeed.
  - Even if we don't succeed, the mere attempt to turn our minus into a plus will cause us to look forward instead of backward; it will replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts; it will release creative energy and spur us to get so busy that we won't have either the time or the inclination to mourn over what is past and forever gone.

## What Life Should Meant to You

- Doing a good deed every day - bringing a smile of joy to the face of another.
- Carl Jung - "About one-third of my patients are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but  from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives."
- Doing good to others is not a duty. It is a joy, for it increases your own health and happiness. "When you are good to others, you are best to yourself."
- "I never go into a hotel or a barber shop or a store without saying something agreeable to everyone I meet. I try to say something that treats them as an individual, not merely a cog in a machine."
- What people want is a little attention as human beings. When I meet a man on the street with a beautiful dog, I always comment on the dog's beauty.
- "A bit of fragrance always clings to the hand that gives you roses."
- "Since I was a good listener and encouraged the boys to talk about themselves, I gave them happiness and I gradually became the most popular girl in our social group."

## Do This and Criticism Can't Hurt You

- People are not thinking about you and me or caring what is said about us. They are thinking about themselves. They would be a thousand times more concerned about a slight headache of their own than they would about the news of your death or mine.
- I couldn't keep people from criticising me unjustly, but I could determine whether I would let the unjust condemnation disturb me.
- Fool things I have done:
  - "What mistakes did I make that time?"
  - "What did I do that was right and in what way could I have improved my performance?"
  - "What lessons can I learn from that experience?"
- Ben Franklin's self-declared faults:
  - Wasting time.
  - Stewing around over trifles.
  - Contradicting people.
- "Every man is a damn fool for at least 5 minutes every day. Wisdom consists in not exceeding that limit."
- "Have you learned lessons only of those who admired you, and were tender with you, and stood aside for you? Have you not learned lessons from those who rejected you, and braced themselves against you, or disputed the passage with you?"
- **I know that when anyone starts to criticise me, if I do not watch myself, I instantly and automatically leap to the defensive, even before I have the slightest idea what my critic is going to say. I am disgusted with myself for it. We all tend to resent criticism and lap up praise, regardless of whether either the criticism or the place be justified. We are not creatures of logic. We are creatures of emotions. Our logic is a canoe tossed about on a deep, dark, stormy sea of emotion. Most of us have a pretty good opinion of ourselves as we are now. But in forty years from now, we may look back and laugh at the persons we are today.**

## Six Ways to Prevent Fatigue

- Fatigue often produces worry, or, at least, it makes you susceptible to worry.
- Rest is not a matter of doing absolutely nothing - rest is repair.
- Psychiatrists declare that most of our fatigue derives from our mental and emotional attitudes.
- Relaxation is the absence of all tension and effort. "Let go, let go, let go and relax."
- Test yourself:
  - "Am I making my work harder than it actually is? Am I using muscles that have nothing to do with the work I am doing?"
  - "Just how tired am I? If I am tired, it is not because of the mental work I have done, but because of the way I have done it."
