# Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work and in Life, One Conversation at a Time

# Introduction

- Our careers, companies, relationships, and live succeed or fail, gradually, then suddenly, one conversation at a time.
- "I knew our strategy wasn't working, but no one was willing to tell our CEO. No one wanted to lose their job."
- We get to good places in our lives one successful conversation at a time. And we are determined to ensure the quality of our ongoing conversations with the people central to our success and happiness.
- *Fierce conversations: one in which we can come out from behind ourselves into the conversation and make it real.* The meaning of real:
  - Interrogate reality
  - Provoke learning
  - Tackle our toughest challenges
  - Enrich relationships
- The conversation is the relationship. If the conversation stops, or if we add another topic to the list of things we just can't talk about, then one day we might just be looking at our shoes.
- Our most valuable currency is relationship, emotional capital.
  - The human condition: we behave emotionally first, rationally second. No matter how logical we claim to be, our emotions are the most powerful factor in how we respond and interact with others.
  - We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has powerful muscles, but no personality. It can not lead; it can only serve.
- If a company has a relationship with its employees based primarily on an exchange of time and talent for a paycheck, that company becomes resume padding for talented employees on their way to bigger and better things instead of the place where they decide to grow their careers.
- Are these the people I want to be in trouble with for the next x years of my life?
- While no single conversation is guaranteed to change the trajectory of a career, any single conversation can.
- *Our lives succeed or fail, gradually, then suddenly, one conversation at a time. The conversation is the relationship. All conversations are with myself, and sometimes they involve other people.*

## Leadership Differences

- Directing/telling → Really asking, really listening, and then directing
- Feedback-free, development-free zone → Feedback-rich, ongoing personal development
- Delegating, abdicating, holding people accountable → Delegating, coaching, modeling accountability, holding people able
- High task/low relationship, culture of compliance → High task/high relationship and the culture of passionate engagement that goes with it
- Silos → Collaborating
- Information-starved → Transparent/inclusive
- Conversation models: team, coaching, delegation, confrontation (resolving attitudinal, performance, or behavioral issues).

## Getting Started

- Listen to yourself, and figure out the times when you were avoiding the topic, changing the subject, holding back, telling little lies, being imprecise, and being uninteresting even to yourself.
- "Let me see if I can get closer to what I really want to say."
- Ask yourself: what is the deepest issue in this confusion, that element that caused less-than-spectacular results? Speak towards that issue, with firmness and concentration.

# Principle 1: Master the Courage to Interrogate Reality

- "People change and forget to tell one another. Not only do we neglect to share this with others, but we are skilled at masking it to ourselves."
- In order to get "it" right, whatever "it" is, we have to explore what is underneath in the murky depths of a conversation, a company, a relationship.
- The world does not get managed. Life is curly. Don't try to straighten it out.
- "What matters anywhere matters everywhere."
- Ask yourself:
  - What are my goals when I converse with people? What kinds of things do I usually discuss? Are there other more important things to work on?
  - How often do I find myself just to be polite, saying things that I don't mean?
  - How many meetings have I sat in where I knew the real issues were being discussed? What issues are we avoiding?
  - If I were guaranteed honest responses to any three questions, whom would I question and what would I ask?
  - What has been the economical, emotional, and intellectual cost to the company not identifying and tackling the real issues?
  - When was the last time I said what I really thought and felt?
  - What are the leaders in my organization pretending not to know? What am I pretending not to know?
  - How certain am I that my team members are deeply committed to the same vision?
  - If nothing changes regarding the outcomes of the conversations within my organization, what are the implications for my own success and career?
  - *What is the conversation I've been unable to have with colleagues and myself?*
- The context with which you believe things affects how you think about the world. Are you "laying bricks", "building a wall", or "building a cathedral"?

## Issue Preparation Form Template

- The issue is: .
- It is significant because: what's at stake, how does this affect dollars, income, people, products, services, customers, or other relevant factors?
- My ideal outcome is: what good things will occur when this happens?
- Relevant background information: summarize with bullet points, how/when/why/where did the issue start? Who are the key players? Which forces are at work?
- What have we done to this point?
- What options are we considering? What would I do if I had no input from the group?
- What do I want from the group? What am I missing? What are you seeing that i might not be seeing?

- Make sure you hear from everyone in the room. Ask for pushback. "I shared what I feel is the right way to go, and I suspect some of you may see it differently. If you do, I'd like to hear it." My job is to make the best possible decisions for the organization, not to persuade you of my viewpoint.
- "I want to be different when this meeting is over."
- When someone challenges you on your idea, resist the temptation to immediately defend your idea. "I hear you, but...".

- The person who can most accurately describe reality without laying blame will emerge as the leader, whether designated or not.
- Try removing "but", replace with "and".

## Getting Real with Yourself

- Compare: "official truths" and "ground truths". No one does herself any favors by staying in a job in which there is very little of her alive. Maybe you just got used to your job and think that "okay, only x years before retiring".
- If you live only for the weekends, then you are in real pain.
  - What activities have my heart?
  - What am I called to do?
  - Is the personal cost I'm really paying worth it?
- ***I am successful to the degree that who I am and what I live for are in alignment. I am doing the right work, with the right people, for the right reasons.*** The quality of our lives is largely determined by the quality of the questions we ask ourselves-and the quality of our answers.
- Right questions:
  - Where am I going?
  - Why am I going there?
  - Who is going with me?
  - How am I going to get there?
  - Am I realizing my full potential?
  - Am I fully extended in my capabilities?
  - Is there value and fulfillment in my work today?
  - What unmet needs am I moved and positioned to meet?

# Come Out from Behind Yourself into the Conversation and Make It Real

- *Authenticity is not something you have; it's something you choose.*
- People often speak out when they are anonymous. We have to claim our failures as much as our successes.
- It's unreal conversations that should scare us to death. Whoever said talk is cheap was mistaken. Unreal conversations are incredibly expensive for everyone.
- Ineffectiveness can be stealthy. It doesn't always come right out and smack you in the face.
- Whether you're running an organization, a team within an organization, or your life, you are required to be responsive to your world.
- Thoreau's Walden: **The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life that is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.** The bigger house, the stuff we buy.
- The cost of a practice is the amount of time, energy, and dollars that must be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.
- *Though you might have run into that burning house, your courage may be failing you where it counts most, in your day-to-day interactions with the people who are central to your success and happiness.*
- The desire to keep our jobs/our good standing with colleagues overrides the impulse to disclose that the latest plan is a really bad idea.
- Tell the truth, admit mistakes, and reveal your plan. Problems rarely solve themselves, and let's talk about it. This is not as easy as it seems:
  - The truth is complicated.
  - There will always be someone who rejects your version. "My truth is truer than yours."
  - Human nature is hardwired to lie, especially when it comes to integrity.
- What to do?
  - Own up to mistakes. Don't just say "mistakes were made".
  - Make yourself available for impromptu conversations.
  - Remain open and available even to those who don't believe you.
- Weak leaders want agreement. Strong leaders want the truth. They tell the truth as they understand it and encourage those they lead to tell them the whole truth, paint the whole picture, even if it's ugly, unpleasant, or not what we wish it to be.
- *Not having meetings where you talk about things will take you longer in the long run.*
- What is the most important thing that we should be talking about? What are our mokitas, the elephants in the room that we're ignoring?
- A painful realization when you reach forty or fifty is the realization that you have no discernible identity, and that somehow, your identity has been compromised.
- How do you feel about your life today?
- What are key aspects of the future you desire?
- Given the gap between your current reality and your ideal future, what conversations do we need to have with others?
- *It is important to spend time conversing with myself, because all conversations are with myself, and sometimes they involve other people.*
- I may think I see you as you are, but in truth, I see you as I am. I see you through my highly individualized context.
- Conversations with others:
  - Boss: career ambitions.
  - Family members: how do we resolve the challenges of our lives.
  - Direct reports: how can I resolve not feeling they are reliable anymore?
- ***Do take it personally. Work is personal. Leading is personal. Everything is personal, if you've addressed "Who am I?" and "What price am I willing to pay to be that?"***
- There is no workable separation of selves at work and at home. We are ourselves all over the place, and it is this real self that is felt and experienced at a deeply personal level by ourselves and everyone on the receiving end of us, whether we acknowledge it or not.

# Be Here, Prepared to be Nowhere Else

- Only when we genuinely see the people who are important to us can we hope to succeed as agents for positive change.
- When someone REALLY asks, we really answer. And, somehow, both of us are validated. Think for a moment about the kind of attention you bring to your conversations. When you chat with someone, are you really listening to them?
- We all know this person who is "I've been hanging out with you for years, and I still don't know who you are or what you want."
- Are you so unengaged or unengaging that nobody hears you, nobody listens to you, or nobody really responds to you?
  - Too polite, too self-conscious, too self-absorbed, too politically correct, too cautious.
  - If you feel that a conversation is needed, it usually is.
- Eye contact. Call out people if they are not looking at you. "If you aren't looking at the people n your team when you're talking with them, they may feel they're invisible to you. They may feel devalued. Is that what you want?
- Don't just listen to words. Listen to the whole person.
- Preparing to have a Fierce Conversation
  - *When we meet tomorrow, I want to explore with you whatever you feel most deserves our attention, so I will begin by asking, "What is the most important thing you and I should be talking about?" I will rely on you to tell me. If the thought of bringing up an issue makes you anxious, that's a signal you need to bring it up.*
  - People will be suspicious, and that's when you have to say that you're important, and we have to stick to this project.
  - Reality will be interrogated. Much better than being blindsided by surprises down the road. The relationship being enriched: we have to give another the purity of your attention, not your advice.
  - One-to-ones should be held often. Optimum time is once a month for one hour.
  - You have to ask the person what they are feeling. When they get into the emotional part of things is when they light the match that propels them into action.
  - *Don't take the problem away from someone. "I'll share my opinion before we end our conversation, but right now, let's keep exploring yours."*
  - Not inquiring about emotions: "What do you feel?"
  - If you have a request, make sure your partner hears and understands it. Don't leave it open for interpretation.
  - Allowing interruptions: turn off or mute your cell phone.
- ***Schedule a one-to-one with someone with work and someone at home. What is the most important thing you and I should talk about today?***

## Mineral Rights, a Simplified Version

- *What is the most important thing you and I should be talking about?*
- *Describe the issue, what's going on relative to so-and-so?*
- *How is this currently impacting you? Who or what else is being impacted? (Emphasis on currently).*
- *If nothing changes, what are the implications? Imagine it is a year later and nothing has changed, what is likely to happen?*
- *How have you helped create the issue or situation, and if you don't know, what would it be if you did know?*
- *What is the ideal outcome? When this is resolved, what difference will that make?*
- *What's the most potent step you can take to being to resolve this issue? What exactly are you committed to do and when?*

## Debriefing

- Was I genuinely curious about this person and his or her reality?
- Did I work to understand what the relationship is from where he or she stands?
- Did I slow the conversation down and really probe?
- Did emotions get expressed, as well as issues and solutions?
- Did I ask this person to say more about any emotions they expressed?
- What parts of me failed to show up?
- Who did the most talking? It should be them.

## Other Good Questions

- What has become clear since we last met?
- What is the area that, if you made an improvement, would give you and others the greatest return on time, energy, and dollars invested?
- What is currently impossible to do that, if it were possible, would change everything?
- What are you trying to make happen in the next three months?
- What’s the most important decision you’re facing? What’s keeping you from making it?
- What topic are you hoping I won’t bring up?
- What area under your responsibility are you most satisfied with? Least satisfied with?
- What part of your responsibilities are you avoiding right now?
- Who are your strongest employees? What are you doing to ensure that they’re happy and motivated?
- Who are your weakest employees? What is your plan for them?
- What conversations are you avoiding right now?
- What do you wish you had more time to do?
- What things are you doing that you would like to stop doing or delegate to someone else?
- If you were hired to consult with our company, what would you advise?
- If you were competing against our company, what would you do?
- What threatens your peace? What threatens the business? Your health? Your personal fulfillment?

- What most people do when they are told that "I have this issue" is that they jump in with a solution. If you have a good story, just tell it after the companion has answered "What's your next step?"

# Tackle Your Toughest Challenge Today

- Hire attitude. Train skill. What attitudes do we want that will lead to success in our company? To what degree do our employees exhibit these attitudes? To what degree am I and other leaders exhibiting these attitudes?
- It just doesn't make sense to wait six to twelve months for a formal performance review to learn how you're doing, if you knew at all times how you were doing in the eyes of your boss/colleagues/customers.
- Important things to think about:
  - What am I paid to do?
  - What are obvious issues that get into the way of doing good work?
  - When and how do we need to have clear expectations about priorities?
  - How close of a fit am I in the role that I am in right now?
  - Do they know what I am adding to the organization?
  - What types of recognition are meaningful to me?
- On giving feedback:
  - Describe the when and the where and the what. Like even after the meeting.
- On receiving feedback:
  - We take it personally, because it IS personal. We know at some point that our work and our personal selves are intertwined.
  - Stay present and ask questions. Lean in, get curious, and ask clarifying questions so that we more fully understand the feedback.
  - *Ask for clarifications, listen to specifics, let them finish their thoughts, present your thoughts without defense or blame, take responsibility for the impact, if you get triggered, admit it, paraphrase what you heard and discussed, and commit to action in the areas you wish to change and ask for support.*
- People who respond well to feedback tend to be looked upon favorably within an organization.

## Statements

- Name the issue. "I want to talk with you about the effect..."
- Select a specific example that illustrates the behavior or situation you want to change: "For example..."
- Describe your emotions about this issue: "I feel..."
- Clarify what's at stake: "I want to share with you what's at stake..."
- Identify your contribution to this problem: "I recognize my contribution to this issue in that..."
- Indicate your wish to resolve the issue: "I want to resolve this issue, the effect that..."
- I want to learn your perspective. What's going on from where you sit?

# Obey Your Instincts

- Audit: in talks, what did you think, but not say? Sometimes, we don't know what we think until we hear ourselves say it aloud.
- Mind-body connection: listen to your personal insights about what you need to do. And take actions on those insights as soon as possible.
- We are too careful, and we are too nice. It's bad to be "playing it safe". A marriage/career/life with no controversy is nothing to be proud of. You cannot hope for accolades without being willing to bear the scars required to win them.
- Conduct an integrity scan: what are your values?
- This is your life. Look for the words that speak to you, that wake you up. Don't worry about what anyone thinks of your list of values.
- People yearn to be connected to something of substance.

# Take Responsibility for Your Emotional Wake

- Emotional wake: what you remember after I'm gone after a conversation.
- Text: Do use it to communicate logistics/directives, share small praises/appreciation, connect on special occasions, talk through scenarios. Don't use it to convey more than three sentences of thoughts at a time, talk about complex topics, share confidential information, and confront someone.

# Let Silence Do th Heavy Lifting

- Think about this:
  - There are no undiscussables in our company/family.
  - There are no hidden agendas in our company/family.
  - During meetings, we say what we think, invite differing views, and explore one another's thinking.
  - There is permission in our company/family for everyone to show up.

# Conclusion

- Great questions to jump-start a fierce conversation:
  - What's the most important thing we should be talking about today?
  - What topic are you hoping I won't bring up? And what topic am I hoping you won't bring up?
  - What do we believe is impossible to do, that if we were able to do, it would completely change the game? How can we pull this off?
  - What values do we stand for, and are there gaps between those values and how we actually behave?
  - What is our organization pretending not to know? What are we pretending not to know?
  - What's the most important decision we're facing, and what's keeping us from making it?
  - If we were hired to consult to our company, what advice would we give?
