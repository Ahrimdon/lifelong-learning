# Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work and in Life, One Conversation at a Time

# Introduction

- Our careers, companies, relationships, and live succeed or fail, gradually, then suddenly, one conversation at a time.
- "I knew our strategy wasn't working, but no one was willing to tell our CEO. No one wanted to lose their job."
- We also get to good places in our live, amazing achievements, one successful conversation at a time. And we are determined to ensure the quality of our ongoing conversations with the people central to our success and happiness.
- Fierce conversations: one in which we can come out from behind ourselves into the conversation and make it real. The meaning of real:
  - Interrogate reality
  - Provoke learning
  - Tackle our toughest challenges
  - Enrich relationships
- The conversation is the relationship. If the conversation stops, or if we add another topic to the list of things we just can't talk about, then one day we might just be looking at our shoes.
- Our most valuable currency is relationship, emotional capital.
  - The human condition: we behave emotionally first, rationally second. No matter how logical we claim to be, our emotions are the most powerful factor in how we respond and interact with others.
  - We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has powerful muscles, but no personality. It can not lead; it can only serve.
- If a company has a relationship with its employees based primarily on an exchange of time and talent for a paycheck, that company becomes resume padding for talented employees on their way to bigger and better things instead of the place where they decide to grow their careers.
- Ar these the people I want to be in trouble with for the next x years of my life?
