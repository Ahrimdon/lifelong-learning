# Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work and in Life, One Conversation at a Time

# Introduction

- Our careers, companies, relationships, and live succeed or fail, gradually, then suddenly, one conversation at a time.
- "I knew our strategy wasn't working, but no one was willing to tell our CEO. No one wanted to lose their job."
- We get to good places in our lives one successful conversation at a time. And we are determined to ensure the quality of our ongoing conversations with the people central to our success and happiness.
- *Fierce conversations: one in which we can come out from behind ourselves into the conversation and make it real.* The meaning of real:
  - Interrogate reality
  - Provoke learning
  - Tackle our toughest challenges
  - Enrich relationships
- The conversation is the relationship. If the conversation stops, or if we add another topic to the list of things we just can't talk about, then one day we might just be looking at our shoes.
- Our most valuable currency is relationship, emotional capital.
  - The human condition: we behave emotionally first, rationally second. No matter how logical we claim to be, our emotions are the most powerful factor in how we respond and interact with others.
  - We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has powerful muscles, but no personality. It can not lead; it can only serve.
- If a company has a relationship with its employees based primarily on an exchange of time and talent for a paycheck, that company becomes resume padding for talented employees on their way to bigger and better things instead of the place where they decide to grow their careers.
- Are these the people I want to be in trouble with for the next x years of my life?
- While no single conversation is guaranteed to change the trajectory of a career, any single conversation can.
- *Our lives succeed or fail, gradually, then suddenly, one conversation at a time. The conversation is the relationship. All conversations are with myself, and sometimes they involve other people.*

## Leadership Differences

- Directing/telling → Really asking, really listening, and then directing
- Feedback-free, development-free zone → Feedback-rich, ongoing personal development
- Delegating, abdicating, holding people accountable → Delegating, coaching, modeling accountability, holding people able
- High task/low relationship, culture of compliance → High task/high relationship and the culture of passionate engagement that goes with it
- Silos → Collaborating
- Information-starved → Transparent/inclusive
- Conversation models: team, coaching, delegation, confrontation (resolving attitudinal, performance, or behavioral issues).

## Getting Started

- Listen to yourself, and figure out the times when you were avoiding the topic, changing the subject, holding back, telling little lies, being imprecise, and being uninteresting even to yourself.
- "Let me see if I can get closer to what I really want to say."
- Ask yourself: what is the deepest issue in this confusion, that element that caused less-than-spectacular results? Speak towards that issue, with firmness and concentration.

# Principle 1: Master the Courage to Interrogate Reality

- "People change and forget to tell one another. Not only do we neglect to share this with others, but we are skilled at masking it to ourselves."
- In order to get "it" right, whatever "it" is, we have to explore what is underneath in the murky depths of a conversation, a company, a relationship.
- The world does not get managed. Life is curly. Don't try to straighten it out.
- "What matters anywhere matters everywhere."
- Ask yourself:
  - What are my goals when I converse with people? What kinds of things do I usually discuss? Are there other more important things to work on?
  - How often do I find myself just to be polite, saying things that I don't mean?
  - How many meetings have I sat in where I knew the real issues were being discussed? What issues are we avoiding?
  - If I were guaranteed honest responses to any three questions, whom would I question and what would I ask?
  - What has been the economical, emotional, and intellectual cost to the company not identifying and tackling the real issues?
  - When was the last time I said what I really thought and felt?
  - What are the leaders in my organization pretending not to know? What am I pretending not to know?
  - How certain am I that my team members are deeply committed to the same vision?
  - If nothing changes regarding the outcomes of the conversations within my organization, what are the implications for my own success and career?
  - *What is the conversation I've been unable to have with colleagues and myself?*
- The context with which you believe things affects how you think about the world. Are you "laying bricks", "building a wall", or "building a cathedral"?

## Issue Preparation Form Template

- The issue is: .
- It is significant because: what's at stake, how does this affect dollars, income, people, products, services, customers, or other relevant factors?
- My ideal outcome is: what good things will occur when this happens?
- Relevant background information: summarize with bullet points, how/when/why/where did the issue start? Who are the key players? Which forces are at work?
- What have we done to this point?
- What options are we considering? What would I do if I had no input from the group?
- What do I want from the group? What am I missing? What are you seeing that i might not be seeing?

- Make sure you hear from everyone in the room. Ask for pushback. "I shared what I feel is the right way to go, and I suspect some of you may see it differently. If you do, I'd like to hear it." My job is to make the best possible decisions for the organization, not to persuade you of my viewpoint.
- "I want to be different when this meeting is over."
- When someone challenges you on your idea, resist the temptation to immediately defend your idea. "I hear you, but...".

- The person who can most accurately describe reality without laying blame will emerge as the leader, whether designated or not.
- Try removing "but", replace with "and".

## Getting Real with Yourself

- Compare: "official truths" and "ground truths". No one does herself any favors by staying in a job in which there is very little of her alive. Maybe you just got used to your job and think that "okay, only x years before retiring".
- If you live only for the weekends, then you are in real pain.
  - What activities have my heart?
  - What am I called to do?
  - Is the personal cost I'm really paying worth it?
- ***I am successful to the degree that who I am and what I live for are in alignment. I am doing the right work, with the right people, for the right reasons.*** The quality of our lives is largely determined by the quality of the questions we ask ourselves-and the quality of our answers.
- Right questions:
  - Where am I going?
  - Why am I going there?
  - Who is going with me?
  - How am I going to get there?
  - Am I realizing my full potential?
  - Am I fully extended in my capabilities?
  - Is there value and fulfillment in my work today?
  - What unmet needs am I moved and positioned to meet?
