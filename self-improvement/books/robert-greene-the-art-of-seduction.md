# The Art of Seduction

- Political figures are required to have a degree of charisma, a fascinating presence to keep their audience's attention, which is half the battle.
- The essence: use pleasure as bait, play on people's emotions, stir desire and confusion, induce psychological surrender.
- It is much more effective to create love than lust. A person in love is emotional, pliable, and easily misled.
- Most of us know the power of having someone fall in love with us: our actions have a positive effect on this person, we feel better about ourselves, and this confidence makes us more seductive.
- A seducer: every social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction. There's never a moment to waste. The power seducers have over a man or a woman works in social environments because they have learned how to tone down the sexual element without getting rid of it.
- Seducers are never self-absorbed. Getting into someone's skin helps the seducer gather valuable information, learn what makes that person tick, and what makes them lose their ability to think straight and fall into a trap.

# The Seductive Character

- Siren: the air of schoolgirl innocence/vulnerability. Both experienced and innocent. Prototype: Aphrodite (confident and offering pleasure/a bit of danger).
- Men can do irrational things just for the danger of it all. The intellectual if one most susceptible to the call of physical pleasure, because his life so lacks it.
- Distinguishing from other women: Cleopatra - high drama, Marilyn Monroe - little girl quality.
- The call of something dangerous, emotional, and unknown is more powerful because it is so forbidden.
- Physical qualities (a scent, makeup, clothing) act the more powerfully because they have no meaning). In their immediacy, they bypass rational processes. The siren must stimulate a generalized desire, by creating that is distracting and alluring.
- The voice, body/adornment (everything must dazzle, but also be harmonious, so that no single ornament draws attention), movement/demeanor.

# The Rake

- The Rake: when he pursues a woman, he really is aglow with desire; the victim senses this and is inflamed, even despite herself. Intense desire has a distracting power on a woman, just as the Siren's physical presence does on a man.
- Choosing words to suggest, insinuate, hypnotize, elevate, infect.
- The use of words as a subtle poison has its applications: it is the form that matters, not the content. If no resistances or obstacles face you, you must create them.
- The Rake's quality: to make women want to reform him. That he is so devoted makes him lovable and seductive to them.

# The Ideal Lover

- Casanova: on meeting a woman, he would study her, go along with her moods, find out what was missing in her life, and provide it.
- By seeming to be what they lack, you will fit their ideal.
- This requires patience and attention to detail. Most people are wrapped up in their own desires that they are incapable of this role.
- Most people believe themselves to be inwardly greater than they outwardly appear to the world. They are full of unrealized ideals: they could be artists, thinkers, leaders, spiritual figures, but the world has crushed them. The Ideal Lover knows how to appeal to people's physical side, but they also appeal to the person's better selves.
- Each of us carries inside an ideal of either what we would like to become, or of what we want another person to be for us. Our ideal may be buried in disappointment, but it lurks underneath, waiting to be sparked. If another person brings that out, we fall in love.
- Ignore your target's words and conscious behavior, focus on the tone of their voice, a blush here, a look there, as those are signs that betray what their words won't say.
- Courtesan: combine the appearance of sensitivity to the pleasures of the flesh with an air of innocence, spirituality, and a poetic sensibility.

# The Dandy

- They create their own persona and cannot be categorized, hinting at a freedom we want for ourselves. They make their own physical image, and they appeal to the narcissism of each sex: to a woman they are psychologically female and to a man they are male.
- 1920s: women wanted a man to be interested in them, they wanted to initiate the affair, but they still wanted the man to end up sweeping them off their feet.
- Feminine dandy: Seduction will always be the female form of power and warfare. It was originally the antidote to rape and violence. The man who uses this form of power on a woman is in essence using these weapons against her, without losing his masculine identity. The more subtly feminine he becomes, the more effective the seduction. Mirroring feminine psychology, he displays attention to his appearance, sensitivity to detail, and a hint of male cruelty.
- Masculine dandy: Nietzsche and Salome: Salome was interested in philosophy, life, adventure, and not marriage. They discussed about philosophy, religion. (Nietzsche had this thing about the superman, a man above everyday morality). That's when N wrote Thus Spake Zarathustra. A purely feminine woman will arouse desire, but is always vulnerable to the man's capricious loss of interest, a purely masculine woman, will not arouse that interest at all. Always retain an air of independence and self-possession.
- *Dandies have existed in all ages and cultures, and wherever they have gone, they have thrived on the conformist role-playing of others.* The Dandy displays a true and radical difference from other people, a difference of appearance and manner. Since most of us are secretly oppressed by our lack of freedom, we are drawn to those who are more fluid and flaunt their difference.
- ***Be different in ways that are both striking and aesthetic, never vulgar; poke fun at current trends and styles, go in a novel direction, and be supremely uninterested in what anyone else is doing. Most people are insecure; they will wonder what you are up to, and slowly they will come to admire and imitate you, because you express yourself with total confidence.***
- Dandies are subtle and never try hard for attention: attention comes to them. Create your own fashion sense by adapting and altering prevailing styles to make yourself an object of fascination.
- Nonconformity goes far beyond appearances-it is an attitude towards life that sets them apart; adopt that attitude and a circle of followers will form around you.
- Dandies live for pleasure, not for work; they surround themselves with beautiful objects and eat and drink with the same relish they show for their clothes. They never try to please, but they adopt psychological traits of the opposite sex, and appeal to our inherent narcissism.
- They key to power is ambiguity: the refusal to conform to standards will excite interest. Be both masculine and feminine, imprudent and charming, subtle and outrageous.
- Dangers: hated by your own sex.
