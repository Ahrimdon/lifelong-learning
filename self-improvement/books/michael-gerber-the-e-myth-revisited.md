# The E-Myth Revisited

## Part I: The E-Myth and American Small Business

### 1: The Entrepreneurial Myth

- The E-Myth is the myth of the entrepreneur.
- Before you started a business, you were probably someone else.
- ***The fatal assumption: if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work.***
  - Now you're forced to learn how to make the business work, rather than to do the work himself.
  - The tragedy is that when the tech falls prey to the Fatal Assumption, the biz that was supposed to free him from the limitations of working for somebody else actually enslaves him.
  - **Suddenly, the job he knew how to do so well because one job he knows how to do plus a dozen others he doesn't know how to do at all.**
- ***Entrepreneurial seizure.***

### 2: The Entrepreneur, the Manager, and the Technician

- In the course of his life, one man acquires many personal qualities, many personages, many "I"'s.
- Everybody who goes into business is actually three people in one: the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.
- The Entrepreneur
  - This is the visionary in all of us.
  - Craves control.
  - He has an overabundance of opportunities, but because he's outdistanced the others re: him being faster than everyone else, he begins seeing people are problems that get in the way of the dream.
- The Manager.
  - Craves order. It sees the problems and is living in the past.
  - He runs after the Ent and cleans up the mess. Without the Ent, there would be no mess to clean up.
- The Technician.
  - "If you want it done right, do it yourself" is the Technician's credo.
  - Tech isn't interested in ideas, he's interested in "how to do it".
  - To the Tech, all ideas need to be reduced to methodology if they are to be of any value, and with good reason.
  - Techs hate getting interrupted.

- The fact of the matter is that we all have an Entrepreneur, Manager, and Technician inside us. The Entrepreneur would be free to forge ahead into new areas of interest; The Manager would be solidifying the base of operations; and The Technician would be doing the technical work.
- Instead, the typical small business owner is only 10 percent Entrepreneur, 20 percent Manager, and 70 percent Technician.
- Ent-driven: no execution.
- Manager-driven: Just organizing.
- Tech-driven: Working with no vision.
- Ent: The business is something apart from you, the owner. Why that business? Why pies instead of a body shot.
- At the heart of the work of an ent is "what would this work be?"
- The work of an ent is to wonder, to see as much of herself as she can, in the future. Future work, "I wonder" is the true work of the entrepreneurial personality.

### 3: INFANCY: THE TECHNICIAN’S PHASE

- Most biz are operated to what the owner wants, vs what the biz needs.
- Tech wants a place to go to work.
- Without a boss, you can do your own thing.
- Now you're doing work you know how to do, but work you also don't know how to do.
- In infancy, you are the biz. It's sometimes even named after you.
- At some point, something gives.
- Infancy ends when the owner realizes that the business cannot continue to run the way it has been; that, in order for it to survive, it will have to change.
- Because you're a tech, you see it from tactics vs strategy.
- You can't just be consumed by the tactical work of the biz.
- If your biz depends on you, you don't own a biz, you have a job.
- **The purpose of going into biz is to get free of a job so you can create jobs for other people.**
- To expand beyond your existing horizons, to invent something that satisfies a need in the marketplace.
- You can't ignore financial/marketing/sales accountabilities/employees need for leadership if you have your own biz.
- The moment you start a small biz, you'll play a larger game than any game you'd ever played before.

### 4: ADOLESCENCE: GETTING SOME HELP

- Get help: production or sales, and def accounting.
- Don't abdicate, delegate.

### 5: BEYOND THE COMFORT ZONE

- Every Adolescent business reaches a point where it pushes beyond its owner’s Comfort Zone—the boundary within which he feels secure in his ability to control his environment, and outside of which he begins to lose that control.
- Abdicating the role of manager/passing it down to Harry. But Harry is also a tech.
- What can happen is the biz can go back to infancy, but you can't close it because it's what pays you.
- Don't trust someone blindly.
- Growth always brings additional responsibilities, skills required, capital to respond.

### 6: MATURITY AND THE ENTREPRENEURIAL PERSPECTIVE

- A Mature business knows how it got to be where it is, and what it must do to get where it wants to go.
- The first reason is that, at the very beginning, I had a very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was finally done. You might say I had a model in my mind of what it would look like when the dream—my vision—was in place.
- The second reason was that once I had that picture, I then asked myself how a company which looked like that would have to act. I then created a picture of how IBM would act when it was finally done.
- The third reason IBM has been so successful was that once I had a picture of how IBM would look when the dream was in place and how such a company would have to act, I then realized that, unless we began to act that way from the very beginning, we would never get there.
- ***In other words, I realized that for IBM to become a great company it would have to act like a great company long before it ever became one.***
- **From the very outset, IBM was fashioned after the template of my vision. And each and every day we attempted to model the company after that template. At the end of each day, we asked ourselves how well we did, discovered the disparity between where we were and where we had committed ourselves to be, and, at the start of the following day, set out to make up for the difference.**
- The Entrepreneurial Perspective asks the question: “How must the business work?” The Technician’s Perspective asks: “What work has to be done?”
- Ent: The biz in its entirety, from which it derives its parts.
- Tech: the biz in parts, from which is constructed the whole.
- Ent Model: The model that fulfills the perceived needs of a specific segment of customers in an innovative way.
- Ent: The biz is a product, competing with other products/biz.
  - How does the biz stand out?
  - Without a clear product of that customer, no biz can succeed.
  - Tech: The product is what he delivers to the cx.
  - Ent: the customer knows that within the cx is a parade of changing wants begging to be satisfied.
- Provide the ent with a model of a biz that works, a model that's so exciting that it stimulate our ent personality.

## PART II The Turn-Key Revolution: A New View of Business

### 7: THE TURN-KEY REVOLUTION

- McDonalds: The Most Successful Small Business in the World.
- Trade name franchise: the value lies in the value of the brand name.
- Business format franchise: People aren't interested in burgers, they are interested if the biz works.
  - The concern was to make sure that his biz would work better than any other.
  - He wasn't competing with other burger biz, he was competing with other biz opportunities for people?
  - It has to work, no matter who bought it.
  - Its components should be assembled at a very low cost, with totally interchangeable parts.
- Franchise prototype.
  - Even if you have McDonald, it really just does what it does.

### 8: THE FRANCHISE PROTOTYPE

- To the franchisor, the Prototype becomes the working model of the dream; it is the dream in microcosm.
- The Prototype acts as a buffer between hypothesis and action. Putting ideas to the test in the real world rather than the world of competing ideas. The only criterion of value becomes the answer to the ultimate question: “Does it work?”
- ***Every possible detail of the business system was first tested in the Prototype, and then controlled to a degree never before possible in a people-intensive business.***
  - The french fries were left in the warming bin for no more than seven minutes to prevent sogginess. A soggy french fry is not a McDonald’s french fry.
  - Hamburgers were removed from the hot trays in no more than ten minutes to retain the proper moisture.
  - The frozen meat patties, precisely identical in size and weight, were turned at exactly the same time on the griddle.
  - Pickles were placed by hand in a set pattern that prevented them from sliding out and landing in the customer’s lap.
  - Food was served to the customer in sixty seconds or less.
  - Discipline, standardization, and order were the watchwords.
  - Cleanliness was enforced with meticulous attention to the most seemingly trivial detail.
- ***Ray Kroc was determined that the customer would not equate inexpensive with inattentive or cheap. Nowhere had a business ever paid so much attention to the little things, to the system that guaranteed the customer that her expectations would be fulfilled in exactly the same way every time.***
- Hamburger University.
- Turn-Key Operation. The franchisee is licensed the right to use the system, learns how to run it, and then “turns the key.” The business does the rest.
- ***The Franchise Prototype is the answer to the perpetual question: “How do I give my customer what he wants while maintaining control of the business that’s giving it to him?”***
- **It’s been there in the form of a Proprietary Operating System at the heart of every extraordinary business around you, franchised or not.**

### 9: WORKING ON YOUR BUSINESS, NOT IN IT

- ***The point is: your business is not your life.***
- Your biz serves your life!
- **The Model Will Provide Consistent Value to Your Customers, Employees, Suppliers, and Lenders, Beyond What They Expect**

- **The Model Will Be Operated by People with the Lowest Possible Level of Skill**
  - Because if your model depends on highly skilled people, it’s going to be impossible to replicate.
  - Context: for the biz. Attorneys, physicians. You need to create the best system through which good attorneys and good physicians can be leveraged to produce results.
  - We want to give the cx the results he wants systematically rather than personally.
  - How can I create an expert system rather than hire one?
  - People make it possible for things that are designed to work to produce the intended results. And, in the process, people who are systems oriented—as all your people must be—learn how to more effectively make things work for your customers and for your business by learning how to improve the systems.
  - The system becomes the tools your people use to increase their productivity, to get the job done in the way it needs to get done in order for your business to successfully differentiate itself from your competition.
  - It’s your job—more accurately, the job of your business—to develop those tools and to teach your people how to use them.
  - There’s another reason for this rule—what I call the Rule of Ordinary People—that says the blessing of ordinary people is that they make your job more difficult.
  - It is literally impossible to produce a consistent result in a business that depends on extraordinary people. No business can do it for long. And no extraordinary business tries to!
  - Because every extraordinary business knows that when you intentionally build your business around the skills of ordinary people, you will be forced to ask the difficult questions about how to produce a result without the extraordinary ones.
  - You will be forced to build a business that works.
  - You will be forced to do the work of Business Development not as a replacement for people development but as its necessary correlate.

- **The Model Will Stand Out as a Place of Impeccable Order**
  - Make the biz look orderly.
- **All Work in the Model Will Be Documented in Operations Manuals**
  - Routinize everything you can.
  - For most people, a job is crucial psychologically, over and above the paycheck. By making clear demands on their time and energy, it provides an element of structure around which the rest of their lives can be organized.

- **The Model Will Provide a Uniformly Predictable Service to the Customer**
  - While the business must look orderly, it is not sufficient; the business must also act orderly. It must do things in a predictable, uniform way.
  - We want to have consistency in our experiences.
  - It reminded me of my first psychology course in college. I recall the professor talking about the “Burnt Child” Syndrome. This is where a child is alternately punished and rewarded for the same kind of behavior. This form of behavior in a parent can be disastrous to the child; he never knows what to expect or how to act. It can also be disastrous to the customer.
  - What you do in your model is not nearly as important as doing what you do the same way, each and every time.

- **The Model Will Utilize a Uniform Color, Dress, and Facilities Code**
  - There are colors that work and colors that don’t. The colors you show your customer must be scientifically determined and then used throughout your model—on the walls, the floors, the ceiling, the vehicles, the invoices, your people’s clothes, the displays, the signs.
  - The model must be thought of as a package for your one and only product—your business.
  - In one test, Cheskin showed that a triangle produced far fewer sales than a circle, and a crest outproduced both by a significant margin!
  - Go to work on your business rather than in it.
  - Go to work on your business as if it were the pre-production prototype of a mass-produceable product.
- Biz
  - How can I get my business to work, but without me?
  - How can I get my people to work, but without my constant interference?
  - How can I systematize my business in such a way that it could be replicated 5,000 times, so the 5,000th unit would run as smoothly as the first?
  - How can I own my business, and still be free of it?
  - How can I spend my time doing the work I love to do rather than the work I have to do?
- **The Franchise Prototype is the name for my business-as-a-product. It’s a way of thinking about my business as one complete thing, a whole, you might say, that looks, acts, and feels in a clearly definable way, apart from me.**

## PART III: Building a Small Business That Works!

### 10: THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

- THE INNOVATION Instead of asking, “Hi, may I help you?” try “Hi, have you been in here before?” The customer will respond with either a “yes” or a “no.” In either case, you are then free to pursue the conversation.
  - If the answer is yes, you can say, “Great. We’ve created a special new program for people who have shopped here before. Let me take just a minute to tell you about it.”
  - If the answer is no, you can say, “Great, we’ve created a special new program for people who haven’t shopped here before. Let me take just a minute to tell you about it.”
- Blue suits outsell brown suits!
- Try to get a salesperson or you to touch the customer on the elbow, arm, or back some time during the sales process.
- What is standing in the way of my customer getting what he wants from my business?
- Quantify everything. Without numbers, you'll have no idea where you are.
- **Orchestration is the elimination of discretion, or choice, at the operating level of your business.**
  - If a blue suit works, wear it every single time you’re in front of a customer,” is the dictum of the disciples of Orchestration.
  - The objective: To give your customer what he wants every single time.
- **Innovation, quantification, orchestration.**
- ***To fully understand the role any action—or any piece of work—plays in the business as a whole, you have to see it as a part of the whole, not as a thing in itself. There are specific ways to do things, which you must convert to a habit.***
  - Apprentice: Everything brings you joy since they are new.
  - Craftsman: Content with the work.
  - Master: The way is to teach another.
  - The heart of the process: to create more life for everyone who comes into contact with the biz.

### 11: YOUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

- **Now you understand the task ahead: to think of your business as though it were the prototype for 5,000 more just like it.**
- Imagine yourself introducing the potential buyer of your business to your people, and standing by while they proudly explain their accountabilities to the fascinated stranger.
- Imagine how impressed the potential buyer of your business would be upon being presented with such order, such predictability, such irreproachable control.

### 12: YOUR PRIMARY AIM

- But before you can determine what that role will be, you must ask yourself these questions: What do I value most? What kind of life do I want? What do I want my life to look like, to feel like? Who do I wish to be?
- You’re telling them the story of your life. How would you like that story to go?
  - What would you like to be able to say about your life after it’s too late to do anything about it?
  - If you were to write a script for the tape to be played for the mourners at your funeral, how would you like it to read?
  - All you need to do is begin living your life as if it were important.
  - All you need to do is take your life seriously.
  - To create it intentionally.
- As with Mature companies, I believe great people to be those who know how they got where they are, and what they need to do to get where they’re going.
- ***Great people have a vision of their lives that they practice emulating each and every day.***
  - ***They go to work on their lives, not just in their lives.***
  - Their lives are spent living out the vision they have of their future, in the present. They compare what they've done with what they intended to do. And where there’s a disparity between the two, they don’t wait very long to make up the difference.
  - **"The difference between a warrior and an ordinary man is that a warrior sees everything as a challenge, while an ordinary man sees everything as either a blessing or a curse."**
- Some good questions to answer:
  - What do I wish my life to look like?
  - How do I wish my life to be on a day-to-day basis?
  - What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my life?
  - How would I like to be with other people in my life—my family, my friends, my business associates, my customers, my employees, my community?
  - How would I like people to think about me?
  - What would I like to be doing two years from now? Ten years from now? Twenty years from now? When my life comes to a close?
  - What specifically would I like to learn during my life—spiritually, physically, financially, technically, intellectually? About relationships?
  - How much money will I need to do the things I wish to do? By when will I need it?
- "Until you lift the curtain, Sarah, until you dare to pull the mask off the world’s face, until you move beyond your Comfort Zone, you will never know what it is you were missing out there."

## 13: YOUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE

- Your Strategic Objective is a very clear statement of what your business has to ultimately do for you to achieve your Primary Aim. It is the vision of the finished product that is and will be your business.
- ***In this context, your business is a means rather than an end, a vehicle to enrich your life rather than one that drains the life you have.***
- Your Business Strategy and Plan are also useful for marketing your business to those who are important to you: your banker, your investors, and your strategic alliances in the business community.
- Your Strategic Objective is just such a list of standards.
  - It is a tool for measuring your progress toward a specific end.
  - It is a template for your business, to make certain that the time you invest in it produces exactly what you want from it.
- The First Standard: Money
  - How big is the company?
  - Gross profits, after-tax.
- The Second Standard: An Opportunity Worth Pursuing
  - An Opportunity Worth Pursuing is a business that can fulfill the financial standards you've created for your Primary Aim and your Strategic Objective.
  - Compare: commodity vs product.
   People buy feelings. As the world becomes more complex, and the commodities more varied, the feelings we want become more urgent.
- Standards Three Through?
  - When is your Prototype going to be completed? In two years? Three? Ten?
  - Where are you going to be in business? Locally? Regionally? Nationally? Internationally?
  - How are you going to be in business? Retail? Wholesale? A combination of the two?
  - What standards are you going to insist upon regarding reporting, cleanliness, clothing, management, hiring, firing, training, and so forth?
-  The business is "All About Pies", and the experience of pies my aunt gave to me. It's the experience I wish to give to other people, not only my customers, but the people I hire. All About Pies is a metaphor for something much finer.
  - 11% profit? If I sell the biz in 7 years, given a realistic price/earnings ratio, I should be able to sell it for more than $1 million. That's basically all my expenses for my life.
  - Document all the things I really know how to do today.
  - I want the biz to be about caring, not about pies. Everything about the business looks, acts, and feels like caring.

## 14: YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY

- I knew that the organizational development reflected in the Organization Chart can have a more profound impact on a small company than any other single Business Development step.
- Most companies organize around personalities rather than around functions.
- Without an Organization Chart, everything hinges on luck and good feelings, on the personalities of the people and the goodwill they share.
- Unfortunately, personalities, good feelings, goodwill, and luck aren't the only ingredients of a successful organization; alone, they are the recipe for chaos and disaster.
- For the next hour or so, Jack and Murray each visualizes how he would like his life to look and writes his conclusions on the page in front of him.
  - Then they spend another hour or so talking about what they wrote, sharing their personal dreams with each other, perhaps discovering in that hour more about each other than they had known in all their years as brothers.
  - Inside of the business, they have agreed, they will from this time forward think of themselves as EMPLOYEES.
- Biz shit.
  - Demographics?
  - Pricing?
  - Loan from bank?
  - Positions: COO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, VP Finance, Sales Manager, even if there are just 2 of them, they at least know what responsibilities have to be done and they can delegate those responsibilities to one another.
  - Position contract: Identifies who's to stand up and what they're being counted on to produce.
- Simple org chart = the blueprint for their Franchise prototype.
  - When you get better, you can replace yourself with a system.
  - First hire: sales person, and there is an operations manual for sales. Dress to code, learn the system, get to work.
- In other words, unless I act in exactly the same way as I expect my employees to act, the system I create will indulge my preferences, rather than what the business really needs to make it possible for everyone other than me to be as productive and happy as possible.
- Because it’s critical if you are to begin your business all over again that you’re able to separate yourself from the roles you need to play. To become independent of them, rather than these roles becoming dependent on you.
- As the owner of the biz, your job is to take care of the horse and the carriage.
- The next most important job is to follow the rules of the game you created with integrity.

## 15: YOUR MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

- The System will become your management strategy, the means through which your Franchise Prototype produces the results you want.
- Management Development—the process through which you create your Management System, and teach your up-and-coming managers to use it—isn't a management tool as many people believe. It’s a marketing tool.
- Hotel's Management System: They asked for his preferences re: coffee and newspaper. The hotel heard him every single time!
- On the back of each checklist is a drawing of the specific room that identifies each task to be completed, and the order in which it has to be done.

## 16: YOUR PEOPLE STRATEGY

- “If you want it done,” I tell them, “you’re going to have to create an environment in which ‘doing it’ is more important to your people than not doing it. Where ‘doing it’ well becomes a way of life for them.”
- The owner takes things really seriously. I'm treated like an adult. -Manager
- ***It was like the hotel was an expression of who he was, a symbol of what he believed in.***
- So if I hadn't taken the hotel seriously, it would have looked like I wasn't taking him seriously, as a man whose values I respected.
- "He wasn't hiring me to work; he was hiring me to do something much more important than that."
- I have so much respect for the Boss. The place is him. If I didn't respect him, I wouldn't be as good as what I do here as I am.
- The work we do is a reflection of who we are.
- "There is no such thing as undesirable work, only people who see certain kinds of work as undesirable. People who use every excuse in the world to justify why they have to do work they hate to do. People who look upon their work as a punishment for who they are and where they stand in the world, rather than as an opportunity to see themselves as they really are."
- "The result of that is always what we experience as the sloppy, inconsiderate, inconsistent, and inhuman transactions that take place between most businesses and the people who buy from them. Exactly the opposite of what we have here."
- Laws
  - The first says that the customer is not always right, but whether he is or not, it is our job to make him feel that way.
  - The second says that everyone who works here is expected to work toward being the best he can possibly be at the tasks he’s accountable for. When he can’t do that, he should act like he is until he gets around to it. And if he’s unwilling to act like it, he should leave.
  - The third says that the business is a place where everything we know how to do is tested by what we don’t know how to do, and that the conflict between the two is what creates growth, what creates meaning.
- ***The idea the Boss has about the business comes down to one essential notion. That a business is like a martial arts practice hall, a dojo, a place you go to practice being the best you can be. But the true combat in a dojo is not between one person and another as most people believe it to be. The true combat in a martial arts practice hall is between the people within ourselves.***
  - "He wasn't looking for employees so much as for players in his game. He was looking for people who wanted something more than just a job."
- ***That people—your people—do not simply want to work for exciting people. They want to work for people who have created a clearly defined structure for acting in the world. A structure through which they can test themselves and be tested. Such a structure is called a game.***
  - That is what the very best businesses represent to the people who create them: a game to be played in which the rules symbolize the idea you, the owner, have about the world.
  - It starts with your Primary Aim and your Strategic Objective, and continues through your Organizational Strategy (your Organization Chart and the Position Contracts for all of the positions in it) and the Operations Manuals that define the work your people do.
  - It is—first, last, and always—about how you act.
  - The game has to be real. You have to mean it.
  - The game is a measure of you.

- **The Rules of the Game**
  - Never figure out what you want your people to do and then try to create a game out of it. If it's to be seen as serious, the game has to come first; what your people do, second.
  - Never create a game for your people you’re unwilling to play yourself. They’ll find you out and never let you forget it.
  - Make sure there are specific ways of winning the game without ending it. The game can never end because the end will take the life right out of your business. But unless there are victories in the process, your people will grow weary. Hence, the value of victories now and then. They keep people in the game and make the game appealing, even when it’s not.
  - Change the game from time to time—the tactics, not the strategy. The strategy is its ethic, the moral underpinning of your game’s logic. This must remain sacrosanct, for it is the foundation of you and your people’s commitment to each other. But change is necessary. For any game can become ordinary, no matter how exhilarating it may be at the beginning.
  - To know when change is called for, watch your people. Their results will tell you when the game's all but over. The trick is to anticipate the end before anyone else does and to change it by executive action.
  - Never expect the game to be self-sustaining. People need to be reminded of it constantly. At least once a week, create a special meeting about the game. At least once a day, make some kind of issue about an exception to the way the game has been played—and make certain that everyone knows about it.
  - Remember, in and of itself the game doesn't exist. It is alive to the degree that people make it so.  To make certain yours isn't, don't expect your people to be something they're not.
  - If you can't think of a good game, steal one. Anyone's ideas are as good as your own. But once you steal somebody else's game, learn it by heart. There’s nothing worse than pretending to play a game.

- **The Logic of the Game**
  - Most people today are not getting what they want. Not from their jobs, not from their families, not from their religion, not from their government, and, most important, not from themselves.
  - What's also missing is a sense of relationship.
  - In a world without purpose, without meaningful values, what have we to share but our emptiness, the needy fragments of our superficial selves?
  - What most people need, then, is a place of community that has purpose, order, and meaning.
  - That’s what a business can do; it can create a Game Worth Playing.
  - It can become that place of community.
  - Giving your customer a sense that your business is a special place, created by special people, doing what they do in the best possible way.

- **Playing the Game**
  - The idea was then communicated to his people, both in word and deed, through a well-planned process.
  - The Boss communicated his idea through documented systems and through his warm, moving, and positive manner.
  - A scripted presentation communicating the Boss’s idea in a group meeting to all of the applicants at the same time. This presentation described not only the idea but also the business’s history and experience in successfully implementing that idea, and the attributes required of the successful candidate for the position in question.
  - Meeting with each applicant individually to discuss his reactions to and feelings about the idea, as well as his background and experience. At this meeting, each applicant was also asked why he felt he was superbly appropriate for the role the position was to play in implementing the Boss’s idea.
  - Notification of the successful candidate by telephone. Again, a scripted presentation.
  - Notification of the unsuccessful applicants, thanking each for his interest. A standard letter, signed by the interviewer.
  - Reviewing the Boss’s idea
    - Summarizing the system through which the entire business brings the idea to reality
    - Taking the new employee on a tour of the facilities, highlighting people at work and systems at work to demonstrate the interdependence of the systems on people and the people on systems
    - Answering clearly and fully all the employee’s questions
    - Issuing the employee his uniform and his Operations Manual
    - Reviewing the Operations Manual, including the Strategic Objective, the Organizational Strategy, and the Position Contract of the employee’s position

- Problem with professional managers:
  - They will manage by the standards they have been taught to manage by in somebody else’s business. Not by your standards.
  - You can’t delegate your accountabilities.
  - And one of the most important set of standards you must establish is a Management System through which all managers, and all those who would become managers in your company, are expected to produce results.
  - The Hierarchy of System:
    - How We Do It Here.
    - How We Recruit, Hire, and Train People to Do It Here.
    - How We Manage It Here.
    - How We Change It Here.

### 17: YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY

- Your Marketing Strategy starts, ends, lives, and dies with your customer.
- For it’s not your customer’s Conscious Mind that has to make the decisions. It’s your customer’s Unconscious Mind.
- Of his reactions, perceptions, attitudes, associations, beliefs, opinions, inferences, conclusions. An accumulation of all his experiences since the instant of his birth (and for all we know, before it) to this very moment when he stands before you.
  - And all his expectations are nothing more or less than the means through which the sum of them all—your customer’s personality—gets fed what it needs.
  - And if the food is compatible with its expectations, the Unconscious Mind says, “Yes.”
  - And if the food is incompatible with its expectations, the Unconscious Mind says, “No.”
- Stuff
  - In a television commercial, we’re told, the sale is made or lost in the first three or four seconds.
  - In a print ad, tests have shown, 75 percent of the buying decisions are made at the headline alone.
  - In a sales presentation, data have shown us, the sale is made or lost in the first three minutes.
- Buying decisions are made irrationally.
  - If anyone cared to do it, it could probably be proved that no one yet has ever made a rational decision to buy anything!
  - He’s not going to think about it.
  - He’s already done all the “thinking” he’s going to do—he either wants it or not.
- The Two Pillars of a Successful Marketing Strategy
  - If you know who your customer is—demographics—you can then determine why he buys—psychographics.
  - And having done so, you can then begin to construct a Prototype to satisfy his unconscious needs, but scientifically rather than arbitrarily.
  - Demographics is the science of marketplace reality. It tells you who buys.
  - Psychographics is the science of perceived marketplace reality. It tells you why certain demographic types buy for one reason while other demographic types buy for another.
- Reality only exists in someone’s perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, conclusions—whatever you wish to call those positions of the mind from which all expectations arise—and nowhere else.
- So the famous dictum that says, “Find a need and fill it,” is inaccurate.
- Because if your customer doesn’t perceive he needs something, he doesn’t, even if he actually does.
- Inquiry, the active solicitation of specific information, and controlled experimentation replaced the guessing, blind hope, and feverish busy work that preceded them.
  - Innovation, Quantification, and Orchestration became the driving forces behind their efforts.
  - The fact is, any small business can do it. And every small business must!
  - If Mature businesses, such as IBM, McDonald’s, Federal Express, and Disney, take such things seriously, then how can you not do the same?
  - The challenge of our age is to learn our customer’s language. And then to speak that language clearly and well so that your voice can be heard above the din.
  - Because if your customer doesn’t hear you, he’ll pass you by.
- How do I determine the demographics and psychographics of my most important customer?, she implored me.
  - What we already know about your business is that it’s attracting someone to it. That while you didn't clearly formulate the ideas at the beginning of your business, we now know that your inner Entrepreneur was busy all the same. That the Caring you wish to express in the All About Pies of the future was in you all the time. It’s expressed today in the delicious quality of your pies, the beauty of your shop, and, I might add, the lovely, albeit frazzled, state of your being.”
  - Who are they/these people?
  - Ask them, in return for a free pie!
  - Other things: what kinds of things they like.
- You have to be interested in everything your business needs. You have to become a student of the art of business and the science of business. Do you realize how much marketing money is spent by companies like McDonald’s, Federal Express, Disney, and Walmart to get it just right?
  - In a small business you simply can’t afford to spend the money they do. But you can afford to spend the time, the thought, the attention, on the same questions they ask.
  - **And that’s why I keep on going back to the true work of the small business owner—the strategic work rather than the tactical work.**
- Marketing
  - In some companies that process is called Lead Generation, Lead Conversion, Client Fulfillment.
  - In your business, Sarah, it’s called Marketing, Sales, and Operations.
  - The COO is the driver of all this. The COO connects each part of the business process. The COO maintains the integrity of the whole by acting as the arbiter of the Strategic Objective he is accountable for fulfilling, of the rules of the game he is accountable for maintaining, of the game the business has chosen to play.

### 18: YOUR SYSTEMS STRATEGY

- There are three kinds of systems in your business: Hard Systems, Soft Systems, and Information Systems.
  - Hard Systems are inanimate, unliving things. My computer is a Hard System, as are the colors in this office’s reception area.
  - Soft Systems are either animate—living—or ideas. You are a Soft System; so is the script for Hamlet.
  - Information Systems are those that provide us with information about the interaction between the other two. Inventory control, cash flow forecasting, and sales activity summary reports are all Information Systems.

- Hard Systems
  - White boards.
  - At the end of a seminar, the person accountable was to clean the board.
  - We had one standard that insisted on impeccably clean walls and another standard that made the first one seemingly impossible to uphold (white boards, white walls, blue ink). In short, we had a conflict between what we wanted and what we had.
  - But a third component was needed to translate the conflict we were experiencing into remedial action: will.
  - Lucite board = solved the thing. Just a system solution to solve a people-intensive problem.

- Soft Systems
  - Things need to be sold.
  - What is a selling system? It’s a fully orchestrated interaction between you and your customer that follows six primary steps:
    - Identification of the specific Benchmarks—or consumer decision points—in your selling process.
    - The literal scripting of the words that will get you to each one successfully (yes, written down like the script for a play!).
    - The creation of the various materials to be used with each script.
    - The memorization of each Benchmark’s script.
    - The delivery of each script by your salespeople in identical fashion.
    - Leaving your people to communicate more effectively, by articulating, watching, listening, hearing, acknowledging, understanding, and engaging each and every prospect as fully as he needs to be.
  - **The Power Point Selling System is composed of two parts: Structure and Substance. Structure is what you do. Substance is how you do it.**
    - The Structure of the System is all of the predetermined elements of the Process, and includes exactly what you say, the materials you use when you say it, and what you wear.
    - The Substance of the System is what you—the salesperson—bring to the Process, and includes how you say it, how you use it when you say it, and how you are when you say it.

#### THE POWER POINT SELLING PROCESS

- **THE APPOINTMENT PRESENTATION**
  - Most believe that the purpose of an Appointment Presentation is to qualify the customer and ascertain whether or not he is a viable prospect. It’s not.
  - The purpose of an Appointment Presentation is one thing and one thing only: to make an appointment.
  - It is a series of words, delivered on the telephone or in person, that engage the prospect’s unconscious (remember?) by speaking primarily about the product you have to sell rather than the commodity.
- **THE NEEDS ANALYSIS PRESENTATION**
  - Re-establish the emotional commitment: Remember, Mr. Jackson, when we first talked I mentioned that some remarkable new things were going on in the world to control money?
  - Tell ways how you would proceed to fulfill your promise to him: Well, what I’d like to do is to tell you about those things. At the same time, I’d like to show you some incredibly effective ways my firm, Walter Mitty Company, has developed to help you to control money here in your business Okay?
  - Re-establish your credibility by communicating two things: your expertise and your personal willingness to do whatever is necessary to use that expertise on their behalf.
    - "We are experts in y. So we created this company because people like yourself are feeling x. The problem with y is z. Do these things frustrate you? This is why we created a system, x, to help you. Let me explain how we propose doing that for you...
  - Explain what your thing does so well.
    - What our thing does is so-and-so. Because we know that this thing needs to be personally tailored, we've created this questionnaire. By asking these questions, we're hoping to help you do so-and-so. Let me leave this questionnaire with you.
    - Once this questionnaire is completed, our financial systems group will check it out.
    - Then, we'll create personally tailored solutions for you.
    - Next, should these solutions make sense to you, we'll be more than happy to so-and-so.
    - So let's review the questionnaire together, and when we're done, I'll provide you with a summary of some of the things that are happening right now re: money.
  - Provide the customer the info he promised/show how relevant it is to the Financial Report he will be preparing.
  - After the Needs Analysis, we'll get another appointment, the Solutions Presentation.
- **THE SOLUTIONS PRESENTATION**
  - The Solutions Presentation is the easiest component of the Power Point Selling Process. Because if Johnny Jones has done his job effectively up to this point, the sale is already made.
  - Selling is opening, not closing. Give the cx a deeper experience of his frustration and to the opportunities available to him by going through the questioning process with you.
  - The Solutions Presentation simply provides the rational armament for the emotional commitment.
  - Here Johnny Jones brings the prospect up-to-date by reviewing everything he said and did during the Needs Analysis Presentation. The prospect has forgotten all those psychographically compelling things by now. But he won’t for long—they’re a part of him.
  - And by doing it the same way every single time, you will not have a selling person but a selling system.
- A Soft System. A completely predictable technology for producing formerly unpredictable results.


INFORMATION BENCHMARK:

- How many calls were made?
- How many prospects were reached?
- How many appointments were scheduled?
- How many appointments were confirmed?
- How many appointments were held?
- How many Needs Analysis Presentations were scheduled?
- How many Needs Analyses were confirmed?
- How many Needs Analyses were completed?
- How many Solutions Presentations were scheduled?
- How many Solutions Presentations were confirmed?
- How many Solutions Presentations were completed?
- How many solutions were sold?
- What was the average dollar value?

- This tells:
  - It could tell you the rate of conversion between any two Benchmarks in your Selling Process.
  - It could tell you at which Benchmark any particular salesperson needs help. Which of your people are “on the system”—that is, using the Selling System verbatim—and which ones are off it.
  - If you had calculated the cost of making a call, you could then calculate the cost of completing the next Benchmark in the process, and from that derive the next, and so on, until you calculate the actual cost of making one sale.

- Hard systems: The signs, floors, walls, display cases. When done correctly, the entire business should look like one fully integrated, beautifully designed system.
- Information systems: Extracting day to day operations about the shop.
- Soft System: Verbal/written communications with anyone who comes into contact with your system. Those are your recruitment scripts, your shop's name, the training you conduct, etc. The story we tell our cx, emps.

### 19 A LETTER TO SARAH

### Epilogue BRINGING THE DREAM BACK TO AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESS

- Boundaries that once served us—geographically, politically, socially, emotionally—no longer exist. The rules are constantly changing. But people cannot live without boundaries, without structure, without rules.
- No, we can’t change the world “out there.” And fortunately, we don’t have to; we can begin much closer to home. We can begin “in here.” In fact, if we’re to succeed, we must. Because the chaos isn't “out there” in everyone else. It’s not “out there” in the world. The chaos is “in here” in you and me.
- If the world reflects a lack of good sense, it’s because each one of us reflects the same. If the world acts as if it doesn't know what it’s doing, it’s because each one of us acts the same. If the world is violent, and greedy, and heartless, and inhuman, and often just plain stupid, it is because you and I are that way.
- And that’s what this book is really about. Bridging the gap.
- For like the Boss’s hotel, your small business can become your dojo, your practice hall. Joe Hyams, in his book Zen in the Martial Arts, tells us what a dojo is:
  - A** dojo is a miniature cosmos where we make contact with ourselves—our fears, anxieties, reactions, and habits. It is an arena of confined conflict where we confront an opponent who is not an opponent but rather a partner engaged in helping us understand ourselves more fully. It is a place where we can learn a great deal in a short time about who we are and how we react in the world. The conflicts that take place inside the dojo help us handle conflicts that take place outside. The total concentration and discipline required to study martial arts carries over to daily life. The activity in the dojo calls on us to constantly attempt new things, so it is also a source of learning—in Zen terminology, a source of self-enlightenment.**
- And that is exactly what a small business is!
  - A small business is a place that responds instantly to any action we take. A place where we can practice implementing ideas in a way that changes lives. A place where we can begin to test all of the assumptions we have about ourselves. It is a place where questions are at least as important as answers, if not more so. It is a place where generalizations must give way to specifics. It is a place that demands our attention. A place where rules must be followed and order preserved. A place that is practical, not idealistic. But a place where idealism must be present for the practical to serve. It is a place where the world is reduced to manageable size. Small enough to be responsive, but big enough to test everything we have. A true practice hall.
- ***When you hear something, you will forget it. When you see something, you will remember it. But not until you do something, will you understand it.***
