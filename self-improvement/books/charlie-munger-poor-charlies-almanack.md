# Poor Charlie's Almanac

# 1: A Portrait of Charles T. Munger

- Hamster breeding, negotiating ability.
- He was smaller than his classmates, so he joined the rifle team varsity.
- U of Michigan, math major, liked physics.
- Harvard Law School, magna cum laude.
- On attracting clients: It's the work on your desk.
- Charlie's success: begin rational.
- I think Warren felt that Charlie was the smartest person he'd ever met, and Charlie felt Warren was the smartest person he'd ever met.
- Good track record of identifying undervalued companies and then either buying large stakes in the public markets or acquiring them outright.
- "It is a grand mistake to think of being great without goodness and I pronounce it as certain that there was never a truly great man that was not at the same time truly virtuous. - Ben Franklin
- I think I had a social defect in my tendency to gain enthusiasm in the course of telling others what I thought they should know.
- As the years have passed, I have encountered more and more criticism from being lost in my own thoughts when others were talking to me.
- Pride in a job well done is vastly constructive. This motivates good conduct in early life, because in remembrance, you can make yourself happier when old.
- *As you pat yourself on the back for behaving well, you will improve your future conduct.*
- Cicero: The normal advantages of youth are inferior to the normal advantages of age. Would you prefer the strength of body or the strength of mind?
  - Socrates: Learned to play the fiddle late in life.
  - "Daily learning something, he grew old."
  - Argues against miserly conduct by the elderly rich: "Can anything be more senselessly absurd than that the nearer we are to our journey's end, we should still lay in more provision for it?"
  - Fear of death is silly. Either you are going to a perpetual, better afterlife, or you won't retain any pain if there is no such outcome.
  - For Cicero, the only life worth living is dedicated in substantial part to good outcomes one cannot possibly survive to see.
  - Early retirement to Cicero is virtually unthinkable.
  - Old age is ever honorable when it takes care to support its proper rights and gives them not weakly away, but asserts them to the last.
  - Not in favor of complaining about personal misfortune.
  - Weak sexual vigor: now you are less likely to disgrace yourself or contract venereal diseases.
  - The best a young person can hope for is to get old before he dies, and it is not fitting to complain about getting the best outcome you could have ever reasonably wanted.
- ***The best armor of old age is a well-spent life preceding it, a life employed in the pursuit of useful knowledge, in honorable actions and the practice of virtue, in which he who labors to improve himself from his youth, will in age reap the happiest fruits of them, not only because these never leave a man, but because a conscience bearing witness that our life was well-spent, together with the remembrance of past good actions, yields an unspeakable comfort to the soul.***

- Buffet stays in the arena with no plan to ever leave. No retirement, boys.
- Benjamin Franklin = even when older, still learned and did stuff.
- "I don't so much being old as I mind being fat and old. I have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first. Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late. When you're finished changing, you're finished."
- Anecdotes:
  - Really big ability to wall off the most intrusive distractions from whatever mental task he was engaged in.
  - Fashion: Marks and Spencer, Brooks.
  - He has a desire exactly what makes things happen. He wants to get to the bottom of everything, whether it's something of serious interest to him or not.
  - He knows how to take all of his brains and all of his energy and all of his thought and focus exactly on a single problem, to the exclusion of anything else.
  - When he's in deep thought, he often loses track of a lot of what's going on around him, including social niceties.
  - When he gets interested in something, HE REALLY GETS INTERESTED IN IT. Find out what you're best at and keep pounding away at it.
  - Bill Gates: He is truly the broadest thinker I have ever encountered. From business principles to economic principles to the design of student dormitories to the design of a catamaran, he has no equal.
  - He has the ability to capture knowledge with simple descriptions. The intelligence of offspring: "the genetic lottery." Venture capitalists who defend stock options: "no better than the piano player in a whorehouse."

# 2: The Munger Approach to Life, Learning, and Decision Making

- Appetite for hard work, but also his insatiable curiosity and patient demeanor.
- Munger/Franklin: A grandmaster of preparation, patience, discipline, and objectivity.
- Charlie can analyze and evaluate any kind of deal faster and more accurately than any man alive. He can see valid weaknesses in sixty seconds.

## Munger's "Multiple Mental Models" Approach to Business Analysis and Assessment

- Studies both the internal workings of the investment candidate as well as the larger ecosystem in which it operates.
- Life is just one damn relatedness after another. So you must have the models, and you must see the unrelatedness and the effects from the relatedness.
- A certain system works way better than the systems that most people use.
- Being willing to change your mind: Charlie is eager to identify and acknowledge his own mistakes and learn from them. "If Berkshire has made a modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year."
- Multiple mental models: redundancy/backup system model from engineering, compound interest from math, breakpoint/tipping moment from physics, Darwinian synthesis from biology, cognitive misjudgment models from psychology.
- He attacks investing with a high degree of preparation and broad-based research. Self-taught system?
- Munger: Doesn't buy or sell very often. When he likes a business, he makes a very large bet and holds the position for a long period.
- Ted Williams: The only baseball player who has a .400 single-season hitting record. He insists on swinging only at balls in his best cells, even at the risk of striking out, because reaching for the "worst" spots would seriously reduce his chances of success. He waits for the bad pitch and swings hard when it comes.
- Focusing on what to avoid first.
- Mr. Market: In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
- Warren Buffett lectures: You can only invest in 20 punches in a lifetime. When you think carefully about what you did, you'd be forced to load up on what you'd really thought about.
- Moats: Competitive advantages (products, markets, trademarks, employees, distribution channels, societal trends). Superior companies have deep moats that are continuously widened to provide enduring protection.
- On being right: you are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right. Apply logic to help avoid fooling yourself. Never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool.
- You need to have a passionate interest in why things are happening. That cast of mind, kept over long periods, gradually improves your ability to focus on reality. If you don't have the cast of mind, you're destined for failure even if you have a high IQ.
- The deep structure of the human mind requires that the way to full-scope competency of virtually any kind is to learn it all to fluency, like it or not.
- To put runs on the scoreboard, watch the playing field, not the scoreboard.
- Charlie: Extreme patience + extreme decisiveness. He can objectively view and measure himself. This gives him objectivity in gauging his actual knowledge, experience, and correctness of thought.
- All intelligent investing is value investing, acquiring more than you are paying for. Value the business in order to value the stock.

- "I think track records are very important. If you start trying to have a perfect one in some simple thing like honesty, you're well on your way to success in this world."
- Taking advantage of a cheap stock price is one thing, but taking advantage of partners or old ladies is something else, something that Charlie just doesn't do.

## Munger's Three Great Lessons of Investing

- A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price.
- A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price.
- A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price.

# Mungerisms: Charlie Unscripted

- It's remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to very intelligent.
- We have a huge are of things that are beneath us.
- Just say "No" ninety percent of the time. You won't miss much in the world.
- *Critique of Money management: the systems is to pretend to do something they can't do and like something they don't. It's a terrible way to spend your life.*
- Critique of Accountants: Aggressive accounting, misusing EBITDA.
- Critique of Stock options: Stock options are sold by one party to another, that give the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at an agreed-upon price within a certain period of time.
- Critique of Financial institutions/derivatives: In engineering, people have a big margin of safety. In the financial world, people don't give a damn about safety.
- Critique of Lawyers: You should have no interest in defending miscreants and letting them misbehave.
- If all you succeed in doing in life is getting rich and buying little pieces of paper, it's a failed life. Life is more than being shrewd in wealth accumulation.
- A lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid: early death, a bad marriage.
- Somebody will always be getting richer faster than you.
_ read a lot.
- Reduce material needs. If you don't have a lot of material goods, then you don't need to be worried about inflation.

# Eleven Talks

- On guaranteeing misery, the prescription is: ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood, envy, and resentment.
- To be miserable:
  - Be unreliable. No man's life should be accounted a happy one until it's over.
  - Do not read about other people's experiences.
- Epictetus: Daily regime of rigorous self-examination.
- Charles Darwin: Gave priority evidence tending to disconfirm whatever cherished and hard-won theory he already had.
- Einstein: Curiosity, concentration, perseverance, self-criticism. Testing and destruction of his own well-loved ideas.
- McDonalds: One of the most reliable institutions, because it teaches teenagers to show up reliably for responsible work.

## A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom as It Relates to Investment Management and Business

- Elementary, worldly wisdom? You can't really know anything if you remembered isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together, then you don't have them in a usable form.
- The models have to come from multiple disciplines, because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department
- Ex of models: Math, compound interest, permutations, probability, accounting.
- On doing things, tell people why. When you tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply.
- Engineering ideas: backup systems, breakpoints, critical mass.
- Elementary psychology: the psychology of misjudgment. Rationality. Microeconomics. Advantages of scale.
- Change is the friend of society, but the absence of change is often the friend of the investor. While the Internet will change many things, it will not likely change the brand of gum people chew. Charlie and I like stable businesses. - Buffett
- When TV came in, you can use the advantage of scale (P&G took advantage of this). Just because something is well known, it has advantages of scale.
- Social proof: we are all influenced subconsciously by what we see others do and approve. If everyone's buying something, we think it's better.
- Disadvantages of scale: narrower distribution.
- The curse of scale: it leads to big bureaucracy, where the incentives are really awful.
- Chain stores and scale: you can run experiments on them.
- Microeconomics: know when a technology is going to kill you or going to help you. Ex: loom means closing all the mills.
- Circle of competence: CM and WB know they are not good in the technical stuff. So they stay away from it.
- You are supposed to beat others in horse raising by virtue of just intelligence, because you are supposed to beat people who rely on lucky numbers.

- What should a young person look for in a career?
  - Don't sell anything you wouldn't buy yourself.
  - Don't work for anyone you don't respect and admire.
  - Work only with people you enjoy.
- Overall life advice?
  - Spend every day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up.
  - Step-by-step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts.
  - You build discipline by preparing for fast spurts.
  - Have low expectations, have a sense of humor, and surround yourself with the love of friends and family.
