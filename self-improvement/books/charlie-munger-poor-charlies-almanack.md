# Poor Charlie's Almanac

# 1: A Portrait of Charles T. Munger

- Hamster breeding, negotiating ability.
- He was smaller than his classmates, so he joined the rifle team varsity.
- U of Michigan, math major, liked physics.
- Harvard Law School, magna cum laude.
- On attracting clients: It's the work on your desk.
- Charlie's success: begin rational.
- I think Warren felt that Charlie was the smartest person he'd ever met, and Charlie felt Warren was the smartest person he'd ever met.
- Good track record of identifying undervalued companies and then either buying large stakes in the public markets or acquiring them outright.
- "It is a grand mistake to think of being great without goodness and I pronounce it as certain that there was never a truly great man that was not at the same time truly virtuous. - Ben Franklin
- I think I had a social defect in my tendency to gain enthusiasm in the course of telling others what I thought they should know.
- As the years have passed, I have encountered more and more criticism from being lost in my own thoughts when others were talking to me.
- Pride in a job well done is vastly constructive. This motivates good conduct in early life, because in remembrance, you can make yourself happier when old.
- *As you pat yourself on the back for behaving well, you will improve your future conduct.*
- Cicero: The normal advantages of youth are inferior to the normal advantages of age. Would you prefer the strength of body or the strength of mind?
  - Socrates: Learned to play the fiddle late in life.
  - "Daily learning something, he grew old."
  - Argues against miserly conduct by the elderly rich: "Can anything be more senselessly absurd than that the nearer we are to our journey's end, we should still lay in more provision for it?"
  - Fear of death is silly. Either you are going to a perpetual, better afterlife, or you won't retain any pain if there is no such outcome.
  - For Cicero, the only life worth living is dedicated in substantial part to good outcomes one cannot possibly survive to see.
  - Early retirement to Cicero is virtually unthinkable.
  - Old age is ever honorable when it takes care to support its proper rights and gives them not weakly away, but asserts them to the last.
  - Not in favor of complaining about personal misfortune.
  - Weak sexual vigor: now you are less likely to disgrace yourself or contract venereal diseases.
  - The best a young person can hope for is to get old before he dies, and it is not fitting to complain about getting the best outcome you could have ever reasonably wanted.
- ***The best armor of old age is a well-spent life preceding it, a life employed in the pursuit of useful knowledge, in honorable actions and the practice of virtue, in which he who labors to improve himself from his youth, will in age reap the happiest fruits of them, not only because these never leave a man, but because a conscience bearing witness that our life was well-spent, together with the remembrance of past good actions, yields an unspeakable comfort to the soul.***

- Buffet stays in the arena with no plan to ever leave. No retirement, boys.
- Benjamin Franklin = even when older, still learned and did stuff.
- "I don't so much being old as I mind being fat and old. I have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first. Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late. When you're finished changing, you're finished."
- Anecdotes:
  - Really big ability to wall off the most intrusive distractions from whatever mental task he was engaged in.
  - Fashion: Marks and Spencer, Brooks.
  - He has a desire exactly what makes things happen. He wants to get to the bottom of everything, whether it's something of serious interest to him or not.
  - He knows how to take all of his brains and all of his energy and all of his thought and focus exactly on a single problem, to the exclusion of anything else.
  - When he's in deep thought, he often loses track of a lot of what's going on around him, including social niceties.
  - When he gets interested in something, HE REALLY GETS INTERESTED IN IT. Find out what you're best at and keep pounding away at it.
  - Bill Gates: He is truly the broadest thinker I have ever encountered. From business principles to economic principles to the design of student dormitories to the design of a catamaran, he has no equal.
  - He has the ability to capture knowledge with simple descriptions. The intelligence of offspring: "the genetic lottery." Venture capitalists who defend stock options: "no better than the piano player in a whorehouse."

# 2: The Munger Approach to Life, Learning, and Decision Making

- Appetite for hard work, but also his insatiable curiosity and patient demeanor.
- Munger/Franklin: A grandmaster of preparation, patience, discipline, and objectivity.
- Charlie can analyze and evaluate any kind of deal faster and more accurately than any man alive. He can see valid weaknesses in sixty seconds.

## Munger's "Multiple Mental Models" Approach to Business Analysis and Assessment

- Studies both the internal workings of the investment candidate as well as the larger ecosystem in which it operates.
- Life is just one damn relatedness after another. So you must have the models, and you must see the unrelatedness and the effects from the relatedness.
- A certain system works way better than the systems that most people use.
- Being willing to change your mind: Charlie is eager to identify and acknowledge his own mistakes and learn from them. "If Berkshire has made a modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year."
