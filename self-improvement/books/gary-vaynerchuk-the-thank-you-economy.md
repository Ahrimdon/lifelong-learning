# Gary Vaynerchuk, The Thank You Economy

- "This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication." —Western Union internal memo, 1876
- "The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?" —an investor in response to David Sarnoff's push for radio, 1920
- "While theoretically and technically television may be feasible, commercially and financially it is an impossibility." —Lee De Forest, radio pioneer, 1926
- "Visionaries see a future of telecommuting workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic. Baloney." —Cliff Stoll, author, astronomer, professor, 1995
- "If I had a nickel for every time an investor told me this wouldn't work…" —Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon

- I've always seen business as a way to build a legacy, and a way to make people happy, but I've also been in the game to make money.
- I'm the kid who ripped people's flowers out of their yards and sold them back to their owners.
- My incentive to make that customer happy wasn't purely altruistic; it was that happy customers are worth a lot more than any other kind. It was grounded in my belief at the time that a business is only as strong as its closest customer relationships, and that what those customers said about our business beyond our four walls would shape our future.
- ***I want people who love running businesses and building businesses as much as I do—whether they're entrepreneurs, run a small business, or work for a Fortune 100 company—to understand what early adopters like me can already see—that we have entered a new era in which developing strong consumer relationships is pivotal to a brand or company's success.***
- It's no longer enough that a strong marketing initiative simply funnels a brand's one-way message down the consumer's throat. To have an impact, it will have to inspire an emotionally charged interaction.
- ***Just as open, honest communication is the key to good interpersonal relationships, so is it intrinsic to a brand or business's relationships with its customers.***
- In the meantime, companies of all stripes and sizes have to start working harder to connect with their customers and make them happy, not because change is coming, but because it's here.
- **Imagine how many more people would have heard that we'd lost an unhappy customer's business if the man who couldn't get his coupon redeemed at Wine Library all those years ago had had a cell phone loaded with a Twitter and Facebook app.**
- The cultural changes social media have ushered in are already having a big impact on marketing strategies, but eventually, companies that want to compete are going to have to change their approach to everything, from their hiring practices to their customer service to their budgets.

## PART I Welcome to the Thank You Economy

### CHAPTER ONE How Everything Has Changed, Except Human Nature

- Think back on the last time someone did something nice for you. I don't mean just holding the door open; I mean watching your dogs while you were away for the weekend or driving forty minutes to pick you up at the airport. How did you feel afterward?
- Grateful, maybe even damn lucky to know someone who would go out of his way like that for you. If given the chance, you'd be sure to reciprocate.
- In fact, no relationships should be taken for granted. They are what life is all about, the whole point. How we cultivate our relationships is often the greatest determinant of the type of life we get to live.
- Real business isn't done in board meetings; it's done over a half-eaten plate of buffalo wings at the sports bar, or during the intermission of a Broadway show. It's done through an enthusiastic greeting, with an unexpected recommendation, or by offering up your cab when it's raining.
- It happens in the small, personal interactions that allow us to prove to each other who we are and what we believe in, honest moments that promote good feelings and build trust and loyalty.
- ***When given the choice, people will always spend their time around people they like. When it's expedient and practical, they'd also rather do business with and buy stuff from people they like. And now, they can.***
- Trusting relationships and connections formed via social media are quickly becoming two subtle but rapidly growing forces of our economy.

#### Social Media Is More than Media

- But what we call social media is not media, nor is it even a platform.
- It is a massive cultural shift that has profoundly affected the way society uses the greatest platform ever invented, the Internet.

#### Great News Is in the Eye of the Beholder

- Finally, a way to really connect with our customers, an opportunity to hear what they want, what they think, how things went, how our product worked, or how it didn't!
- No more focus groups.
- Think of all the money that brand managers could have saved over the decades on test marketing and other classic research techniques which, in all these years, haven't done much to improve a new product's risk of failure, estimated at 60 to 90 percent; they'd be looking cross-eyed at today's social media marketing skeptics for not recognizing great news when they hear it.
- If it's true that one-to-one is quickly becoming one of the most important ways to reach customers, then it means a massive number of businesses are eventually going to have to undergo a total cultural transformation to compete.

#### Why I Speak in Absolutes

- Because if I give you an inch, you'll run a mile with it.
- When I said in 1998, "You're dead if you don't put your business on the Internet and get in on ecommerce," was that true? No.
- But boy, can you imagine trying to be in business in 2010 with zero Web presence?
- I'd rather shock you into paying attention, and admit later that business rarely requires an all-or-nothing approach, than take the chance that you won't take the situation seriously enough.
- Unfortunately, a lot of business leaders and marketing professionals can't see that change is here. (Not coming. Not around the corner. Here.)
  - The building blocks necessary to create a powerful, legacy-building company culture
  - How to re-create the perfect date when developing your traditional and social media strategies
  - Using good intent to set everything in motion
  - Delivering shock and awe to your customers without investing a lot of money, just a whole lot of heart

#### The Heart and Soul of the Matter

- How do people decide they like each other? They talk. They exchange ideas. They listen to each other. And eventually, a relationship forms.
- The process is no different for building relationships with customers. If your organization's intentions transcend the mere act of selling a product or service, and it is brave enough to expose its heart and soul, people will respond.
- Social network affects people's purchases. People will make business and consumer decisions based on what they see talked about on social media platforms.
- ***When I first started tweeting, I had no brand recognition; no one knew who I was. To build my brand, I started creating conversations around what I cared passionately about: wine.***
- I used Search.Twitter to find mentions of Chardonnay. I saw that people had questions, and I answered them. I didn't post a link to WineLibrary.com and point out that I sold Chardonnay. If people mentioned that they were drinking Merlot, I gave them my Merlot recommendation, but I didn't mention that they could buy Merlot on my website.
- I didn't try to close too early, like a nineteen-year-old guy; I made sure to invest in the relationship first. Eventually, people started to see my comments and think, "Oh, hey, it's that Vaynerchuk guy; he knows Chardonnay.
- Oh cool, he does a wine show—let's take a look. Hey, he's funny. I like him; I trust him. And check it out: he sells wine, too. Free shipping? Let's try a bottle of that…." ***That's what caring first, not selling first, looks like, and that's how I built my brand.***
- **That's what I mean about revealing your company's heart and soul. There's only so low you can go on price. There's only so excellent you can make your product or service. There's only so far you can stretch your marketing budget. Your heart, though—that's boundless.**
- Maybe it doesn't sound realistic to expect anyone to be that emotional in business, but hey, how many people thought they would be tending to a virtual farm three years ago? Meanwhile, at its peak Farmville saw 85 million players.

#### When Caring Meant Business

- Old people reminisce about how retailers and local businesses made it a point to know your name and make you feel like family when you walked in. As well they should have.
- Back then, there was no need to encourage people to buy local. Local was, for the most part, all there was.
- If your mother bought her meat at Butcher Bob's, it was pretty likely that you shopped at Butcher Bob's, too. Butcher Bob knew your family, knew your tastes, and knew that during the cold months he should reserve a hambone for you to flavor your weekly batch of split-pea soup.
- How Butcher Bob treated you when you walked into his store was as crucial as the quality of his ground beef. It was that if you weren't happy with the service you received—if, for example, Butcher Bob refused to reimburse you for the freshly ground chuck that you brought home only to discover it wasn't so fresh—you'd vent your outrage to the PTA, or a trade union meeting, or the country club.
- That was Butcher Bob's worst nightmare, if the PTA, trade unions, or country club members represented a big chunk of his customer base. To lose one disgruntled customer could often mean losing ten of his or her friends and relatives. In the smaller, tight-knit communities of yesteryear, ten people represented a lot of revenue.
- ***Often, the business wasn't just a way to make money; it was something the owners and managers closely identified with and in which they took pride.***

#### Word of Mouth Loses Its Voice

- These decades that brought greater distance between friends, family, and neighbors coincided with the rapid rise of big business.
- Butcher Bob retired just in time to avoid being crushed by the newly built Safeway supermarket chain, which would eventually include over two thousand stores across the country.
- If the company that treated Great-Grandma like royalty even when she was only buying a two-dollar hat had grown and prospered, in all probability a corporation gobbled it up.
- The prioritization of profit over principle quickly took over American corporate culture and is what shaped the perspective of all ranks of many of today's business leaders. Most have never known anything else. They're just playing the game as they were taught.

### If You Don't Care, No One Will

- Companies started unloading anything that didn't immediately and directly track to pumping up their bottom line. It wasn't just about replacing the hats with cheaper, more modern fashions. Nor did it mean simply phasing out little extras that made a customer feel like royalty. It meant power bombing anything that showed the company cared about the customer experience at all.
  - Supermarkets stopped hiring teenagers to load bags and carry them to the car. Gas station attendants disappeared except in New Jersey and Oregon. And if you wanted to speak to a company about their product or service, you could press 1 to spell your name, press 2 to place an order, press 3 for more options, or press the star key to return to the main menu.
  - As the 1980s rolled into the 1990s and companies relied increasingly on automated call centers, we were ushered into a customer service dark ages.
- People griped and moaned, but there was nothing they could do. Some even swallowed the company lie that eliminating the unnecessary, time-consuming, expensive perks that customers used to take for granted—such as the privilege of speaking to a live human being—made it possible to keep prices down. We loved talking to you, but our loss is your gain. Enjoy the savings!
- For business, our Internet love affair was a gift from the gods.
  - In theory: websites are available 24/7. In practice, this allowed outsourcing customer service.
  -  Their customer base was no longer in the local zip codes within a five-or even fifteen-mile radius—it was the entire country, and in some cases, the whole world. So what if one person got her panties in a bunch? How many people, realistically, were going to take the time to find sites like Paypalsucks.com, read them, post on them, and tell their friends?

### Small-Town Living Moves Online

- Social media allowed us to become more aware of the minutiae in each other's lives, of what was going on, of what people were thinking and doing, than ever before.

#### A Full-Circle Power Shift

- Still, most businesses, save for some ambitious entrepreneurs, didn't see any upside to jumping on that train. Where could it possibly go that could be of use to them? Many leaders failed to see—some of them still fail to see—that the game they all learned to play has finally started to change.
- Social media represents a gigantic power shift back to the consumer.
- Consumers have more direct, daily contact with other consumers than has ever been possible in the history of the planet.
- More contact means more sharing of information, gossiping, exchanging, engaging—in short, more word of mouth.

#### How the New Word of Mouth Is Different

- Word of mouth is back.
- Now, the Internet has matured so that the power of social media can allow all the ants to collectively gather under the table, and they're strong enough to haul it away if they so choose.
- Any businessperson who can't see the repercussions of that much potential word of mouth has his or her eyes closed.
- According to Facebook, as of 2010, the average Facebook user has 130 friends, and the average Twitter account holder has 300 followers, which in total add up to a potential 7,740 people who suddenly have Monsanto's name flying in front of their eyes.
- Some saw it, some didn't. But of those who did, who knows how many silently reposted it to people who might then, in turn, have reposted it? Think about how many thousands of people that represents.
- Businesses that aren't able or willing to join the conversation will likely see their balance sheets suffer, and catch hell from Wall Street. That's the best-case scenario. Worst case, they aren't going to be in business much longer.

#### Power to the People

- Finally, when faced with bad service or unfair policies or plain old indifference, there is something people can do.
- Suddenly, everyone who's ever had a problem with a company can compare notes, work him-or herself up into a righteous frenzy, and build enough animosity via word of mouth to create a real PR nightmare.
- Giorgio Galante, who took AT&T to task on his blog called So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, wrote two emails to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson.
- This example perfectly reflects the magnitude by which word of mouth has exploded. Five years ago, it wouldn't have mattered that this guy was upset. He would have told four people.
- Before, it made some financial sense for big business to simply ignore people they considered whiners and complainers.
- Now, dissatisfied, disappointed consumers have the power to make companies feel the pinch.

#### The Thank You Economy

- ***At its core, social media requires that business leaders start thinking like small-town shop owners.***
- They're going to have to take the long view and stop using short-term benchmarks to gauge their progress.
- They're going to have to allow the personality, heart, and soul of the people who run all levels of the business to show.
- And they're going to have to do their damndest to shape the word of mouth that circulates about them by treating each customer as though he or she were the most important customer in the world.
- **We're living in what I like to call the Thank You Economy, because only the companies that can figure out how to mind their manners in a very old-fashioned way—and do it authentically—are going to have a prayer of competing.**
- I approach business the same way I approach every talk I present—I bring this attitude whether I have an audience of ten or ten thousand.
  - Everybody counts, and gets the best I have to give.
  - A lot of the time, we call people who do a consistently great job "a professional," or "a real pro." I try to be a pro at all times, and I demand that everyone I hire or work with try to be one, too.
  - All my employees have to have as much of that caring in their DNA as I do.
  - ***I always say that the real success of Wine Library wasn't due to the videos I posted, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.***
- At Wine Library, we don't just pull out the charm when a big spender walks in, or when someone is unhappy, and we don't reply to inquiries with carefully worded legalese.
- We try not to calculate that one customer is worth more than another, and therefore worth more time and more effort, even as we recognize that a big customer can bring a lot to the table.
- If there's a problem, we at Wine Library never tell ourselves that once we handle this issue, we'll never have to deal with the person again. We talk to every single person as though we're going to wind up sitting next to that person at his or her mother's house that night for dinner. We make it clear that we want to help in whatever way we can, and that everyone's business matters to us. And we mean it.

- Sometimes, no matter how hard we try, we lose because someone else established the relationship first. I've had people tell me that though they like what I do and live in my town, they buy from the other guy's liquor store because he's been good to them.
- I say, "I'm cheaper and I have a way better selection and I'll be good to you, too! Heck, I'll be better!" but I can't win, because a relationship has already been formed.
- I can compete on price, I can compete on convenience, and if they'd give me the chance I'd compete on caring, too.

#### A Gift to Customers and Companies

- People want this level of engagement from the companies with which they do business. They always did, but they lost the power to demand it.

#### Exceed Expectations or Lose

- Before, people were satisfied if you sent them an e-newsletter and the occasional 10-percent-off coupon in the mail.
- Now, the standards have been raised by companies like Zappos, which will spend as much time on the phone with you as you need, and Fresh Direct, a New York online grocer that wraps your produce in bubble wrap and tucks an extra bunch of asparagus in with your order just to thank you for being such a great customer.
- Now, it is true that the more you give, the more people want.
- Now, people expect you to give a damn about them.
  - Not only that, they expect you to prove it.
  - And the only way to prove it is to listen, engage, give them what they want when you can, and, when you can't, give them an honest answer why. They just want to be heard and taken seriously. That's all.

#### What Caring Looks Like

- Imagine you are the CEO of Super Duper Fans, Inc., sitting in your local coffee shop, and you overhear one patron say to another, "You know, you really get what you pay for.
- I'm trying to go green by not using my A/C so much, so I went out and bought a bunch of fans. I didn't want to spend a fortune, either, so I bought those Super Duper fans, the ones with that great ad on TV."
- Any executive or manager or sales rep who cares about the company and believes in what it does wouldn't hesitate to approach the table, introduce him-or herself, defend the product, apologize for any inconvenience, and ask for another chance to prove how great the Super Duper fan really is.
- You might offer to replace the defective models (throwing in free shipping and delivery, of course) and include a 30 percent coupon for any other Super Duper product. You'd do it in a heartbeat, and not out of the goodness of your heart, not because you're a nice person, but because you care about your company and want everyone who does business with you to have a great experience.

#### Get on Board

- If you're an entrepreneur, you surely already know I'm telling the truth because if you're having any success, it's extremely likely you're already engaging with your customers online and offline with equal intensity and enthusiasm.
- I hope my ideas and the examples in this book will inspire you to take your business to the next level, and give you ways to help others trying to make it.
- One more time: if you succeed with social media, it won't be because of the platform; it will be because you acknowledge that culture and consumer expectations can change.
- You are more adaptable and flexible than your competitors. If you apply social media correctly, your customers will buy more, they will be more loyal, they will spread your message, and they will defend you should you ever need them to.
- You know the business world has changed. You can feel it, can't you? Go to a shopping mall, a movie theater, a stadium, and look at what the masses are doing. For better or for worse, half if not more of the people are walking around with their heads down, their fingers sliding and tapping over their handheld devices.

- Zagat vs Yelp:
  - 1979: The Zagats hit upon the idea of collecting opinions from their friends and their friends' friends of New York City restaurants to create an informal yet reliable restaurant guide. Over the next two decades, The Zagat Review becomes an internationally recognized force in the culinary world, with over 100,000 contributing surveyors and a loyal readership.
  - 1999: Zagat launches its website, but only paid subscribers can read full reviews.
  - 2004: Former PayPal employees Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons launch Yelp from a San Francisco Mission Street office. The decidedly hip site offers free access to user reviews of restaurants, day spas, and other local businesses.
  - 2007: Yelp reports five million unique visitors.
  - January 2008: The Zagats try to sell their business for $200 million. There are no takers.
  - May 2008: Yelp reports ten million unique visitors.
  - June 2008: The Zagats take the business off the market.
  - July 2008: Yelp releases the Yelp for iPhone app. The application is free.
  - November 2008: Zagat releases the Zagat to Go iPhone app. It costs $10.
  - July 2009: Zagat holds steady as one of the top ten iPhone apps in the travel category.
  - August 2009: Yelp, which is still free, reports over 25 million unique visitors.
  - September 2009: Zagat.com, which charges a $25 annual membership fee, gets about 270,000 unique visitors per month, and is "trending downward."
  - December 2009: Yelp turns down a $550 million offer from Google, and a $700 million offer from Microsoft. "Yelp has the chance to become one of the great Internet brands," says Stoppelman. "That for me is the chance of a lifetime."
  - January 2010: Modeling Foursquare, Yelp adds a "check in" feature to its app upgrade.
  - February 2010: Zagat teams up with Foursquare. Foursquare users can earn a "Foodie" badge when they check in to Zagat-rated restaurants, and receive menu recommendations from the Zagat collection of reviews.
  - August 2010: Zagat is ranked the most-followed brand on Foursquare by Osnapz, with 65,000 followers.
  - August 2010: Zagat integrates Foodspotting, which allows people to post photos and comment about the foods they love rather than read and write full-blown reviews, into the Zagat To Go app.

- The Thank You Economy is much, much bigger than social media. Social media's arrival was simply the catalyst for a revolution that was already brewing in the minds of consumers sick to death of feeling isolated, unappreciated, and ignored.
- The Thank You Economy explains how businesses must learn to adapt their marketing strategies to take advantage of platforms that have completely transformed consumer culture and society as a whole.
- Social media is here to stay, but eventually, some technological innovation will be invented that will give intrepid travelers, the ones who understand that these trains of change are the only trains coming, another chance to move way ahead of the risk-averse.
- What will not change, however, is the culture—the expectation—of communication, transparency, and connection that social media revived.
- We live in a world where anyone with a computer can have an online presence and a voice; whatever follows next will simply make the power of word of mouth that much more powerful.
- The proliferation of blogs, with their invitation to comment, and the transparency of Facebook and Twitter, has marked an economic turning point.
- ***People thought they had seen a massive cultural shift when the public adopted the Internet into their daily lives, but the bigger shift occurred when the Internet began to allow for two-way conversation. Learn how to implement a culture of caring and communication into your business, scale your one-to-one relationships, and watch your customers reward your efforts by using their new and massively powerful word of mouth to market your business and your brand for you.***

### CHAPTER TWO Erasing Lines in the Sand

- In 1997, shortly after I launched WineLibrary.com, I was invited to a conference hosted by a local chapter of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce to talk about online selling.
- You know if this had happened in 2010, the talk would have been recorded and I could have posted it to show everyone what a jerk he was. But believe it or not, even though he called me a kid, he did earn my respect for calling me out.
- I like people with competitive spirit and bravado; they bring out the fight in me. Not that I won any battles that day. I walked out onstage and opened my talk by saying, "With all due respect to Mr. PowerPoint, he has no idea what he's talking about. He is going to be on the wrong side of history. I feel bad for him."
- Jeffrey Preston Bezos had that same experience when he first peered into the maze of connected computers called the World Wide Web and realized that the future of retailing was glowing back at him.
- Looking back, I can't hold Mr. PowerPoint's skepticism against him, nor can I blame the audience for dismissing most of what I had to say. Most people's DNA simply doesn't allow them an entrepreneur's anticipation skills.

#### Resistance Won't Kill You Right Away

- What should the horse-and-buggy driver have done when he noticed the automobile? Sell the frigging horses, of course!
- Company leaders may not see their lack of participation in social media reflected on their P&L statement, but I promise that, unless something else sinks their company first, they will.
- No big company loses to a little company if they are totally committed to winning the fight. Barnes & Noble went online in 1997, but they didn't go in 100 percent; they couldn't have, or Amazon wouldn't have taken over so much of their market. Barnes & Noble should have come at Amazon the way Fox and NBC came at Google, when they developed a true rival, Hulu, to combat Google's YouTube.

### CHAPTER THREE Why Smart People Dismiss Social Media, and Why They Shouldn't

- As I've discussed, Wall Street doesn't make it easy for companies to take many risks.
-" It's possible that for now those headlines and others like them are technically true, but if they are, in almost every case, the reason is the same—most of the companies already attempting to use social media platforms aren't using them correctly.
- ***And the reason they're not using them correctly is generally because they aren't fully committed to it; they still don't get that intent matters.  It is true that you need to use social media because otherwise your competitors will get ahead of you.***
- Yet how we speak and behave when we're going through the motions of caring is vastly different from how we speak and behave when we care from the bottom of our hearts. Our intent affects the force of our actions, so if a leader has simply got a case of monkey see, monkey do (where people throw themselves and their companies into social media solely because their competitor is doing it) and her intent isn't to infuse every aspect of her business with Thank You Economy principles, of course she'll never reap the full benefits.

#### Excuses Why Companies Don't Use Social Media

- ***There's no ROI.*** But let me ask this: what is the return on investment for any kind of customer caring? Is there a formula that calculates how many positive interactions it takes to pay off in a sale or in a recommendation? No, but until now good managers and salespeople have killed their customers with kindness anyway, because even without hard numbers to quantify the ROI, they instinctively know that earning a customer's trust is key.
  - Now, Nielsen has numbers that prove the link between generating trust and making a sale isn't just theoretical. When Nielsen conducted a study on what drives consumer trust, the results were clear: almost 70 percent of people turn to family and friends for advice when making purchasing decisions.
  - When faced with two equal choices, people often buy for no other reason than they associate one choice with someone they know. My friends shop at Wine Library, and they go out of their way to do so. Most of my acquaintances from high school shop at Wine Library, too. There is a Dell consumer out there who buys Dell because he has an uncle who works there.
  - Social media, which allows people to see their family and friends' preferences and interactions with brands, allows for many more chances for people to make the personal associations that can lead to buying decisions.
- The ROI of your relationship with your mother is going to be much higher than that of the one you have with a good friend. ***Without social media, you and your customer are relegated to strangers; with it, depending on your efforts, you can potentially upgrade your relationship to that of casual acquaintances, and even, in time, to friends.***

#### Consumer patterns re: Advocates

- Advocates' share of wallet is 33 percent more than that of customers who aren't advocates.
- Advocates spend about 30 percent more dollars with their favorite online retailers than non-advocates do.
- Advocates stick around longer, proving themselves less likely than other customers to switch to a competitor even if it offers similar products at similar prices.
- Advocates have significantly higher lifetime value than regular customers.
- According to Nielsen, consumers are generally more motivated to reach out to a company with a complaint than with praise. However, they are willing to publicly praise a company when given the opportunity to do so.
- Social media allows companies to provide ample prompts for consumers to remember why they like a brand, and inspire them to say so publicly, whether on the company website or via social networking channels.
- 40 percent of consumers switched to buying from a competitor because of its reputation for great customer service.
- 55 percent cite great service, not product or price, as their primary reason for recommending a company.
- 66 percent said that great customer service was their primary driver for greater spending.

- ***The metrics aren't reliable.***
  - If you place television ads, you've probably been making enormous financial decisions based on the Nielsen ratings for years, trusting them to tell networks who is watching what shows so the networks and cable stations can charge you a fortune to place your brand in your target demographics' line of sight.
  - But what about engagement? The new tool from Nielsen measures the effect of online ads, not whether all that time a company spends talking to customers online translates to sales. How about paying for SEO? SEO, what the heck is that? Now, you put a lot of money into SEO.
  - Will there still be ways for consumers to game the system? Of course. But the vast majority of people on Facebook and Twitter are actually living within the medium. If they're not there, the conversation stops.
  - If they get distracted or lose interest, the conversation changes. The data businesses can collect about what their customers are talking about, with whom they're talking about it, and how often, is far less ambiguous than it's ever been.

- ***Social media is still too young.***
  - The wait-and-see approach, the one most companies have used while considering when to invest in traditional platforms, won't work for social media.
  - First-to-market in this hyper-fast world has impact.
  - Companies can no longer just spend money and get in on the game.
  - For once, I'm begging businesses to take the easier path. Embarking on one-to-one customer engagement offers significant long-term rewards, but the company will also experience immediate benefits—greater brand awareness, stronger brand loyalty, increased word of mouth, improved understanding of customer needs, and better, faster consumer feedback—and suffer very few drawbacks, if any.
  - This isn't just about hitting someone with an image so many times it sears your brand name into the person's brain. It's about building relationships, and relationships take time. The twelve months you wait to get in on this is twelve months that your competitor will have spent connecting and building goodwill and trust with customers who could have been your customers.
  - Real, lasting friendships take emotional investment, and I took too long to decide to invest. Social media relationships and personal relationships work exactly the same way—you get out of them what you put into them. You can't buy them, force them, or make them into something they're not ready to be.
  - The longer you hesitate to build a presence on this platform, the more you will struggle to make it work for you.
  - Though as I keep repeating, the number of people with whom you have connections is far less important than the quality of those connections, it's just a fact that most of the world looks at those numbers and judges you for them.
  - If this platform worked like TV or radio, a celebrity or an established brand might just buy someone else's fan base to make themselves look better, much the way companies buy up smaller companies or databases.
  - Amazon could do what many acquirers do—fold the newly acquired company into the parent company, adapt the Zappos business processes to match their own, take over the Zappos warehouses, suck all the soul out of it and leave nothing intact but the logo. Amazon would have the customers, sure, but it would not have the customer relationships. If Zappos were no longer the Zappos they knew and loved, the customers would abandon ship, and ultimately Amazon would gain nothing from the acquisition.
  - Fortunately, Amazon gets that the key to Zappos' success is to leave it alone and keep its soul intact, so it will probably reap the benefits it was looking to buy.
  - I believe we're dawning on an era when more people will recognize the value of quality over quantity, but until then, the effect of low numbers on your brand will feel like a bee sting compared to the hemorrhaging gunshot wound it will feel like if you do nothing. Get in, and then start swimming better and faster than anyone else. You do this by being more genuine and more caring, by creating better content, by keeping your thumb on the pulse of the space, and by being more engaged.

- ***Social media is just another trend that will pass.***
  - Why wouldn't Facebook suffer the same fate when the next hot platform comes along? But it wouldn't matter. If users one day abandon Facebook in favor of something better, they won't be jumping off the train, they'll simply be moving to a new car. Move with them. The relationships you've worked to build won't evaporate so long as you follow your customers and keep up the caring.

- ***We need to control our message.***
  - I would love to see that companies have recognized the stupidity of this argument by the time this book is in print, but I have a funny feeling many still won't.
  - ***A lot of companies resist building a Facebook wall, blogging, or starting a Twitter or YouTube account because an irate customer might post negative comments. So what? Would you prefer that the customer post them somewhere else where you have absolutely no way to reply?***
  - You can't control the message; that ship has sailed. Yes, things can go crazy-mad online, and companies have suffered from out-of-control negative word of mouth.
  - Overall, problems can be fixed if you catch them in time. If you plead your case quickly and sincerely, you'll gain back the customers' trust, as Ann Taylor did. When Ann Taylor LOFT introduced their silk cargo pants on their Facebook page in the summer of 2010, a wave of online customers complained that no one except a giraffe-sized, skinny model could possibly look good in them.
  - To prove them wrong, LOFT employees of all heights and sizes posted photos of themselves wearing the pants. The response was extraordinary: tons of comments from women thanking LOFT for listening, some even admitting that they might wear the pants.
  - Now I can make a personalized video on YouTube for free and send it to anyone, anywhere, with a bottle of wine or a $100 credit. There are so many more channels we can now use to communicate our good intent directly to our customers, with a personal, individually customized message that is impossible to achieve through TV or print.
- Business leaders consistently underestimate two things. First, they underestimate people's willingness to forgive. They are afraid to put up fan pages because they think any negative comment is equal to a 60 Minutes private investigation showing the whole world how much they stink.
- Second, they underestimate people's bullshit radar. That's why it never works when a brand launches an effort that effectively tries to trick people to retweet, like a "Fan me up and I'll donate to Haiti" campaign, or tries to make something go viral.
- Giving people what they want doesn't translate to caving every time someone makes an unreasonable demand or threatens to tweet out something ugly. Even if you can't satisfy every desire, you can make it clear that you wish you could.) Many times people lash out because they feel as though it's the only way to get some attention—the squeaky wheel gets the grease, after all.
- What's brilliant about social media platforms is that no matter what someone else chooses to say about you, you can put the facts out there, on your fan page, on your blog, and in your tweets.
  - People can track events and dialogue as they unfold. Everyone can see the exchange and make his or her own judgment call. As long as you stay on message, and remain honest, polite, and as accommodating as possible, you'll have nothing to fear from someone with a grudge.
  - Good manners are about treating your customers with respect at all times. You may not be able to control the message anymore, but you can absolutely control the tone in which the message gets played.
- Controlling their message and their image explains why so many—too many—companies still refuse to allow their employees to publicly blog and tweet about their work. I understand their fear, but it's unwarranted. In fact, there might be no better way to know for sure that you're making smart hiring decisions. ***Allow your employees to talk freely, let them say what they want, because then you will have a much clearer picture of who your employees are and how they feel about your company.***

- ***I don't have time to keep track of what every Joe or Jane says, and I can't afford/don't want to pay someone else to do it.***
  - You cannot reserve your care and attention for your best, most profitable, most desirable customers anymore.
  - If you are a one-person company and you want to grow your business, you're going to have to make time to track conversations yourself because you simply can't afford not to.
  - If you establish the tone and voice of your brand to your satisfaction, you'll create a solid foundation for someone else to build upon when you do eventually delegate the task, or share it with someone else.

- ***We're doing fine without it.***

- ***We tried it; it doesn't work.***
  - Faced with disappointing results, they patted themselves on the back for trying something new and then slammed the door shut. If they're progressive, they chalked up the failure to getting in too early on an immature platform, but most are convinced the platform is hype, and not worth the effort.
  - Social media is a long-term play, which is why the majority of the companies that have tried it have failed to reach their potential. The fault doesn't lie with company managers and leaders, however.
  - It's not anyone's fault, really. The problem is that the system on which most corporate decisions are made is broken.

- ***The legal issues are too thorny.***
  - My industry, liquor and wine, is highly regulated, and I know how many challenges there can be when a company tries to embark on something new.
  - That's why change has to come from the top. Only the CEO or another leader of the company can sit down with the legal department and say, "This company is embracing social media. Instead of focusing heat-seeking missiles on perceived fatal flaws in this, let's figure out how to take an acceptable risk and make it possible."

- ***It takes too long to pay off.***
  - But the fact is that social media is a marathon—you cannot reach the finish line without patience and determination. That's why diversification is so important. I know there is a place for traditional media in a well-planned marketing budget, but in today's marketing mix, it's overpriced. Let me repeat: In this environment of heavy content consumption, I believe that most traditional media is overpriced.

- ***Social media works only for startup, life style, or tech brands.***

- Being small is an advantage, because an individual can really shape a brand with his or her own style and personality. But a large company can scale one-on-one to the masses, because it has the resources to train enough people to engage in every conversation.
- ***It's true that some products are sexier than others, but it's also true that if there weren't a need for your product, you wouldn't be in business.***

- I think we're entering a business golden age.
- Now it's widely understood that intellectual capital is part of the backbone of every organization, and worth protecting.
- In the future, the companies with tremendous "relationship capital" will be the ones to succeed.
- Ten years from now, every company will have a Chief Culture Officer on staff and, if big enough, a team dedicated to scaling one-on-one relationships.
- ***In the end, no matter what obstacles a company faces in the Thank You Economy, the solution will always be the same. Competitors are bigger? Outcare them. They're cheaper? Outcare them. They've got celebrity status and you don't? Outcare them.***

## PART II How to Win

### CHAPTER FOUR From the Top: Instill the Right Culture

- It seems to me that anyone who knows Bezos's track record and still criticizes this acquisition is someone for whom numbers tell the entire story.
  - I think he looked into the future, and the future was Zappos. Here was a company that, according to off-the-record sources, was outselling Amazon on some non-footwear products that Amazon sold for less.
  - There are only two things that will convince consumers to pay more for something when they could pay less. One is convenience, and the other is an outstanding customer experience.
  - This wasn't a buy based on numbers; it was a buy based on culture and trends. That's why Bezos is a visionary.
- He doesn't explicitly say this in the YouTube video that he made to explain the buy. What he does say is, "I get all weak-kneed when I see a customer-obsessed company, and Zappos certainly is that."
  - He also makes the point that he believes Amazon and Zappos are compatible because they both obsess over customer service (though as Tony Hsieh points out in the letter he wrote to Zappos employees to announce the deal, they do it in different ways). Specifically, what he says is, "When given the choice of obsessing over competitors, or obsessing over customers, we [Amazon] always obsess over customers."

#### One-to-One Management

- Zappos has an amazing work environment. There's free food in the cafeteria, a library, and a lot of happy employees. I'm willing to bet that most of the companies that are praised for outstanding customer service also fall pretty high on the scale of great places to work.
- I work my staff to the bone. Still, I know they're happy, because while perks might make employees think harder before deciding to leave, there are only two things that make employees really, really happy and make them want to stay.
  - ***The first thing that makes an employee happy is being treated like an adult. That means that until people prove that they can't be trusted, they should be allowed to manage their job as they see fit.***
  - ***The second is feeling that his or her individual needs are being met. This is rare.***
- For example, at Vaynermedia, we recently established a new vacation policy: there is none. Some people have kids; others don't. Some people have family that lives nearby; others have to travel long distances to visit loved ones. Some people just need a little more downtime to recharge than others.
  - I'm passionate about team building, so I don't hire anyone who wants to work from home on a regular basis.
  - We need to be available when our clients are working, so project managers need to be in by 9:00 and the execution team should be in by 10:30 a.m.
  - But within those parameters, I let my staff manage their time themselves. What difference does it make what time they leave, or how much vacation they take, so long as they are there when I, their colleagues, or their clients need them, they are doing their job 110 percent at all times, and they're meeting their objectives?

#### Cultural Building Blocks

- ***BEGIN WITH YOURSELF.***
  - Strong self-awareness makes a strong culture possible. Remembering who you are and the qualities that have made you successful until now, whether you're a CEO, an executive, or a mid-level manager, is extremely important as you work toward developing, sustaining, and spreading the company culture.
  - It won't happen if you try to wear anyone's hat but your own.
  - Self-aware leaders don't waste a lot of time or money trying to be something they're not.
- ***COMMIT WHOLE HOG.***
- ***SET THE TONE.***
  - As soon as leaders commit to building a caring culture, they need to send a strong, direct message about their intent. Employees should be able to feel the difference immediately.
  - Internally, he and his cofounders have made it clear that the welfare and future of Boloco's employees are paramount, from providing health care to all full-time and most hourly employees to offering English and Spanish classes to all staff in an effort to improve in-house communication and allow non–English-speaking workers to rise to roles of greater responsibility.
  - PERSONAL Not a whiff of corporate speak. Pepper mentions his wife, offers other alternatives, and sounds genuinely sorry the customer is unhappy.
  - HONEST He doesn't make any promises he can't keep, and explains the practical and financial reasons why the unpopular decision had to be made.
  - ACCOMMODATING He offers a way for the customer to try some other options on the menu, free of charge.
- ***INVEST IN EMPLOYEES.***
- ***TRUST YOUR PEOPLE.***
  - I'm pretty good at recognizing one of my own, so the employees I hire tend to be people who share a lot of my DNA. That's one of the reasons why I know I can give them so much freedom—most of them are built like me, and share, or at least do their best to keep up with, my over-the-top work ethic.
  - Authenticity is a huge part of what makes social media initiatives work. In addition, allowing your employees to use Twitter, YouTube, Quora, Facebook, and blog posts to talk about your brand and their work not only provides them a venue for expression, it gives you, or your CCO, another window through which you can see how they do their job.
  - Combine those observations with the ones you make about their performance on the job, and you'll quickly know who's a superstar and who needs some more training.
  - One year, the day before Christmas, I asked one of my top guys how he was doing. He looked me right in the eye and said, "I bleeping hate this place and I hate you." Well, I hadn't seen that coming. Did I appreciate getting cursed out by an employee? Not at all. But I knew him well, which means I knew that there were circumstances in his life that might make his already hot temper flare up.
  - We talked, and together we figured out a way to rearrange his workload so that he didn't feel as if his back was against a wall. He was a stock boy back then, making less than ten dollars a day; today he is one of Wine Library's top executives.
  - But there's still a risk, right? What if someone does say something he or she shouldn't, something that could negatively affect you or your brand? There's very little an employee can say to hurt your company that you can't fix if you act with speed and good intent.
  - A manager found a popular satirical animated video pitting EVO versus iPhone 4 on YouTube, and realized a store employee had created it. Though the video didn't mention Best Buy, other less popular videos the employee created did, and the company felt that the popular video was criticizing the iPhone.
- ***BE AUTHENTIC.***
  - People can smell BS even across an oil-slicked Gulf. With the power of social media to spread articles, images, videos, and audio recordings around the world in minutes, authenticity, and the long-term relationships that can result from authentic interaction with consumers, will almost always be the deciding factor in how a brand or company survives a false step in the Thank You Economy.

#### Empower People

- I like to imagine that midsize and large companies will open something that I would love to call the Give A Crap department.
- For the purposes of this book, I'll call it the Social Media department, headed by a community manager, and populated by a small army of champion carers dedicated to interacting and engaging with every customer they can find.
- But in the Thank You Economy, big companies behave a lot more like small companies. In small companies, employees often serve multiple roles and it's expected that they will pitch in wherever they are needed.
- Customer service could now look like the business analyst who works in the Vitamin Water accounts payable department; at the park on a Saturday, he sits down on a bench just as a guy takes a swig from a Dragonfruit flavor Vitamin Water and says to his buddy, "I love this flavor." The analyst whips out his card and says, "I'm so glad you like it. Email me and I'll send you an online code for a free case. Thanks for enjoying our beverage!"
- If the analyst worked for a company that didn't have the resources to offer free product, a simple "I work for Vitamin Water. I'm so glad you like our product. Thanks for drinking it." will still knock an unsuspecting customer's socks off.
- When it comes to customer care in the Thank You Economy, there is little difference between online and offline behavior. It's all public.

### CHAPTER FIVE The Perfect Date: Traditional Media Meets Social

- If you live in the New York area, you might have seen ads for Crush It on a billboard located right next to the Meadowlands, where my beloved New York Jets play football, and on a few taxi tops zooming around the city.
- Even though the viewership and absorption rates in traditional media are way, way down from where they used to be, they still carry some cachet and can offer some results.
- ***To many, you're not a legitimate brand unless you have a presence on those platforms. So when I found myself in a position to barter consulting time in exchange for some ad space on top of a taxi for my book, I didn't think twice.*** As for the billboard, it said, "Ask me how much I paid for this billboard," and listed my email address. In one fell swoop, I got to promote my book, create an opportunity for dialogue, and gauge people's interest in the question. To anyone who followed through, I gave the answer: I spent fifteen hundred bucks on a billboard for which many brands spend ten thousand.
- I had a great relationship with the rep that sold me the billboard space. I've worked with him before. He's a terrific guy, full of hustle, very persistent, and he pays close attention to what I'm up to and contributes lots of ideas to help me.
  - By now, though, I know the billboard game, so I knew what to ask for, and I knew when to back down and when to press on. Because we have such a good relationship, we were able to work together to come up with a mutually acceptable deal.
- Second, I cared like crazy. Compare the mind-set of an account manager at an ad agency, whose big-brand client gives her $5 million to spend, $300,000 of which is allocated for billboards, with that of a small-business owner who feels as though every dollar she spends on media is coming from her own pocket.
  - The small-business owner is going to fight much harder for the best deal.
  - How much a person cares factors a great deal in how that person does business. That's not to say that account managers and the other people companies hire and trust to manage aspects of their business don't care about their clients. Many do. Many care a lot.
  - But it takes a special person to adopt a sense of ownership and identification with his or her client. If you believe you've got someone like that in your court, hang on to that person with all your might.
- I can reach a hell of a lot of people by caring them to death online, but I recognize that some people just aren't there yet. Those people matter to me. I want to go where they go.
  - I would advertise in every magazine, from Fortune to People, if I felt they were charging me the right price for their ad space. ***I am certain that the right price is not $35,000 for a full page. That's a figure calculated upon circulation numbers, but not upon actual readership.*** There is no way you can tell me that every person who picks up the magazine is going to see the actual page upon which my ad appears. I believe the pricing should reflect that reality, and I believe that every company that buys advertising should demand fairer pricing.
  - If you haven't done it yet, you've got to find a way to reallocate some money in your budget toward social media, because it is utter insanity for any company not to have a Facebook and Twitter presence in 2011.

#### Extend the Conversation

- Combining traditional and social media can allow you to do the same thing when talking to people about your brand. Denny's, for example, had a great TV date with its customers during the 2010 Super Bowl. It ran three commercials announcing that for a few hours on the following Tuesday, you could come in for a free Grand Slam breakfast.
- The ads were funny and creative—chickens freaking out over how many eggs they were going to have to lay for the event—but what a missed opportunity to leverage all the people watching the ads with their laptops open in front of them!
  - All Denny's had to do was say, "Go to Facebook.com/Denny's right now, become a fan [an option that was supplanted by the "Like" button], and receive a coupon for an additional free large OJ.
  - " Hundreds of thousands—maybe millions—of people would have gone to the site, spent some time engaging with the Denny's brand, and gotten their coupon, and Denny's would have had data that they could use and reuse for years.
  - So, Denny's spent about $10 million to produce three ads and gave away a lot of free product. They gave their customer a nice experience and more than likely gained some new customers, too.
  - But had Denny's established relationships with their customers on a social networking site, they would have stretched the value of those $10 million.
  - By clicking "Like" on a brand's Facebook page, customers show their willingness to offer data about themselves that allows the brand to communicate directly with them and tailor its marketing in an extremely personal, customized way.
  - As the consumer-brand engagement shows up in the consumer's newsfeed, the message spreads even farther through the social media ecosystem with no additional effort by the brand. If Denny's had extended the conversation, the date might have ended with an invitation for a nightcap instead of a chaste kiss at the door.
- Reebok invited its audience in for a drink with its television ad for Speedwick training T-shirts. The two start shooting pucks into the open dryer—first to get nine in wins. Talbot is leading 3–1 when the screen abruptly goes black and the words "See who wins at Facebook.com/reebokhockey" appear. Only by becoming a fan could viewers find out who won.
  - Then it drew them in even further by giving them a reason to follow the brand to Facebook. And follow they did. In a short amount of time, Reebok saw their numbers jump by the tens of thousands. In and of themselves, numbers mean nothing—it's the quality of one's followers and fans that really matters, not the quantity. But in this case, Reebok had both, and the numbers represented tens of thousands of people who gave Reebok permission to remarket to them.

#### Learn to Play Ping-Pong

- Instead of spiking their traditional media and ending the match, Reebok hit the ball back over to social media. Develop creative work that allows the platforms to rally, to work together to extend your story, continue the conversation, and connect with your audience.
- It's not enough to simply throw a Twitter or Facebook logo at the bottom of your ad, or show `Facebook.com/yourbrand` at the end of your TV commercial.

### CHAPTER SIX I'm on a Horse: How Old Spice Played Ping-Pong, Then Dropped the Ball

- Thanks to the TV ad, millions of people—women, especially—now felt something for Isaiah Mustafa, and were linking his manly abs to the Old Spice brand.
  - So, five months and a second TV spot later, when P&G marketers used Twitter's promoted trend ad platform to ask Old Spice followers on Twitter and Facebook, as well as users on Reddit and Digg, to submit questions for the Old Spice Man, they replied enthusiastically.
  - People voted for their favorite questions, and the winners received personal replies from the Man himself. Old Spice Man also initiated contact with celebrity influencers. The Internet went wild as people found out they could talk directly to the man who could ride a horse backward and catch a birthday cake while sawing through a kitchen.
- Quality content is king. But from now on, quality content must be followed up with quality engagement.
  - You had better be ready and waiting to engage your consumers online when they start googling and tweeting and facebooking to find out more about the awesome content they just experienced, because that's how our consumer culture works now.
- The Old Spice campaign wasn't cheap. The production values were high for video, the actor cost money, a team had to keep track of all of those mentions of Old Spice zipping around the Internet, the scripts were being written by four writers as fast as the questions came in, and the whole thing started with a multimillion-dollar TV ad buy.
- Did the Old Spice thing work?
  - The earned media was fierce. Practically every marketing and tech blogger, and almost every media and news outlet in the country, covered the story.
  - Old Spice's YouTube channel reported more than 11 million views and over 160,000 subscribers. Eleven million impressions—not the worst number I've ever seen. And, Proctor & Gamble now has data on 160,000 people they didn't have before, and they can use that data to remarket to those consumers. How much is it going to cost them this time? Zero.
- To recap how Old Spice brilliantly executed one-on-one engagement:
  - It established brand equity on TV with fantastic content.
  - Then it extended the compelling story to Facebook and Twitter
  - And to Digg, Reddit, and several other smaller ponds
  - Whose users went to the big YouTube pond to see the videos
  - Where they experienced a level of a brand's personal attention and engagement that has rarely, if ever, been seen before
  - And then tweeted and commented like crazy about it
  - Which garnered coverage for the campaign on television, in print, and on radio, making Old Spice, your grandfather's brand of deodorant, national news.

- The miss:
  - Every one of those people should have received an email, thanking the followers for watching the videos and offering them a reason to keep checking in.
  - As of September 2010, almost two months after Old Spice ambushed Twitter, the Old Spice account has tweeted only twenty-three times, and not one of the tweets talks or interacts with an actual person or user of the brand.
  - Ad Age published an article that begins "Old Spice Fades Into History…" If I were captain of that ship, you can bet that ten thousand tweets would have gone out since July 14, the last day of the response video portion of the campaign.
  - To me, it looks like Old Spice is a sprinter stuck in a traditional marketing mind-set, not a marathon runner living in the Thank You Economy.
- So the answer to the question of whether this campaign worked depends on whom you ask.
  - Ninety-nine percent of the market would probably say that it was a social media win—it caused buzz, it resulted in a fantastic amount of earned media, and ultimately, sales did spike.
  - Ninety-nine percent of market, however, doesn't realize that we're in a Thank You Economy, and it is using old media standards to tally up its victories.
  - ***I mean, what their silence on Twitter tells me is that they're through with me. They're glad that I, and thousands of others, spent our money with them, and now they're just going to sit back on their laurels, enjoy the spike in revenue, and move on to a new campaign.***

### CHAPTER SEVEN Intent: Quality versus Quantity

- If you've ever considered embarking on a social media campaign, or even tried an initiative or two, what was your intent?
  - Was your goal to get someone to click through or click the "Like" button?
  - Or was it to build your online identity and foster a connection between yourself and the consumer?
  - "What's wrong with getting people to click through?" you might ask. "What's wrong with using social media to drive traffic to my site or store?" Nothing. ***But if the only reason you're on YouTube, Tumblr, Twitter, or any other vibrant online community, is because you're trying to attract more followers and fans than the other guy so you can market your message to that user base, you're playing the wrong game and you're going to lose.***
- Success in social media, and business in general, in the Thank You Economy will always have to be measured with an eye toward both quality and quantity.
  - ***You can throw meaningless tactics around to increase your numbers, but even if they work and your online numbers look impressive, you won't have gained anything of true value because you didn't put anything of true value out there.***
  - ***All the numbers prove is that you've made contacts, not connections.***
  - ***Social media works best when you evoke an emotion in the people to whom you're reaching out. It pulls. When you place a traditional ad, you're spending a lot of money to hold on to the microphone and say your piece over and over and over again.***

#### Day-to-Day Intent

- Your intent should be twofold: water as many plants as possible, and put out every fire. When you're tending to online relationships, every engagement should be answered with emotion, from the heart.
  - That does not mean you have to write a sappy love letter to everyone who praises your brand. Emotion doesn't have to be wordy; it just has to be authentic.
  - Some companies want to be able to say they have a social media presence, but they're so frightened of the legal issues that could arise with one stray, unfiltered post that they demand that any company Twitter feeds or Facebook updates be vetted. In some organizations, getting legal approval for a tweet can take twelve to thirty-six hours. Are you kidding me? By the time that vetted post finally makes it to the customer, the conversation and the relationship have sailed.
  - ***Please, companies, stop hiring PR firms to do your community management. They're used to talking with editors, writers, and producers, not the public.***
  - They have no idea what's going on in the trenches, and they're awkward and shaky when they try to go there. The only reason PR claims they can do it is because they see which way the wind is blowing, and it's not toward them.

- ***Push tactics aren't all bad; they can be effective when used in moderation. But the intent of push tactics must be to create a pull opportunity, for that's what creates emotional bonds between consumers and brands.***

### CHAPTER EIGHT Shock and Awe

- If you ask phenoms to share the secret to their success, many will often reply that it was paying attention to the little things. The athlete got up early every morning for an extra hour of training; the high-end restaurateur made families feel welcome with early-bird hours and adult-quality kid food served in charming frog-shaped dishes; the car wash owner provided Wi-Fi.
   -What's remarkable about the little things is that the positive impact they have on a person's performance or a customer usually far outweighs the effort or cost it takes to implement them.
  - In the Thank You Economy, the same can be said for the big things. Most people usually think the big things are initiatives that only big companies can instigate, because it is assumed that to pull them off takes tremendous coordination and budgets.
  - When he added, "What else is he going to do—50 Cent diapers for your little gangsta?", Ruane received almost a million hits. Rather than ignore the kid, or even take offense, 50 Cent flew him to New York City and posted a new YouTube video of the two of them hanging out together, all friendly-like, on a balcony overlooking Manhattan.
  - The video isn't all that exciting, but the fact that it even exists is extraordinary. 50 Cent was smart. He saw how word of mouth was spreading Sexman's message and decided to take control of it by showing that he may be a media whore, but he's a good sport, too.
  - 50 Cent simultaneously nipped a problem in the bud, made a Canadian teenager and his fans smile, and reaped some good earned media.

- It's hard for some execs to wrap their heads around the idea of spoiling customers like this, because a large number of people who run companies are salespeople at heart, not marketers; if they can't immediately close the deal, see a unit sold or an uptick in profit, or if they don't believe the scale of the initiative is powerful enough to move the needle, it doesn't feel worthwhile.
  - But we don't do shock and awe because we're saints.
  - While the best thing about shock and awe is how great it can make customers feel, not to mention the pleasure we get from spreading some happiness, we do it because there is always a win.

## PART III The Thank You Economy in Action

### CHAPTER NINE Avaya: Going Where the People Go

- Avaya.
  - Originally engaging in one thousand interactions—replying to questions, addressing comments, et cetera—per week, the social media team now fields almost four thousand.
  - They also developed a product that can alert the customer service department when disgruntled tweets need to be addressed.
  - The company estimates that by adopting this method, they've avoided losing approximately fifty customers, at an average cost of sale to replace them of about $10,000.
  - Too many B2B companies are still avoiding social media because they don't believe their customers are part of the social media demographic.

### CHAPTER TEN AJ Bombers: Communicating with the Community

- I am convinced that the biggest disconnect for business leaders lies in their understanding of how they should treat customers they meet face-to-face, and how they should treat the ones they meet through their computer, iPad, or phone.
- There should be no difference. Customers or potential customers can have some powerful emotions when they're considering using your product or service.
- By the way, tech companies often err in the other direction by forgetting to talk to customers in the "real world."
  - Companies such as Groupon or Microsoft seem like disembodied, untouchable entities, but they have real-life customers and should try to meet them occasionally.
  - They need to look for ways to bring their customers together, for example, by throwing a party to mark an important anniversary, or hosting a video-streamed town hall meeting where customers can come together to discuss issues they'd like to see resolved.
  - The companies that understand how to genuinely connect with their customers, online and offline, are the ones that will emerge over the next twenty-four to thirty-six months, putting significant distance between themselves and their competition.

### CHAPTER ELEVEN Joie de Vivre Hotels: Caring About the Big and the Little Stuff

- ITS INTENT COMES FROM THE RIGHT PLACE. The company seems to work extremely hard to balance its business intent—to grow a profitable business—with intent from the heart—to provide travelers with a unique, customized, memorable hotel experience.
- IT HIRES CULTURALLY COMPATIBLE DNA. Providing these word-of-mouth–worthy experiences on a regular basis is possible only when a company can tap extremely rich reserves of creativity, care, and empathy.
- IT USES "PULL TACTICS."
  - The intent of most tactics, and advertising campaigns as well, is to entertain, inform, or scare the consumer enough that he or she pays attention.

### CHAPTER TWELVE Irena Vaksman, DDS: A Small Practice Cuts Its Teeth on Social Media

- Professionals:
  - Read someone else's commentary or experience about health or medical issues on an online news group, website, or blog
  - Consulted rankings or reviews online of doctors or other providers
  - Consulted rankings or reviews online of hospitals or other medical facilities
  - Signed up to receive updates about health or medical issues
  - Listened to a podcast about health or medical issues
- Besides her information on Facebook, you can also find Dr. Vaksman on Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

#### The Ideal Intent

- She opened her practice with one clear goal: to provide the ideal patient experience.
  - That experience would necessarily involve providing the most knowledgeable, current, and technologically up-to-date standards of dental care.
  - It was also contingent on her ability to establish strong one-on-one relationships, possible only by taking enough time during every visit to build rapport, by getting to know her patients well, and by proving that she cared not just about their teeth but about their overall well-being.
- Besides establishing a presence on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn, she became the first dentist in the city to offer a Groupon, and the experiment brought new patients to the five-month-old practice in droves.
- ***Dr. Vaksman seems to understand something that I brought up in the early chapters of this book—the complaining customer who uses social media is a better customer to have than a silent one.***

### CHAPTER THIRTEEN Hank Heyming: A Brief Example of Well-Executed Culture and Intent

- What do you call a lawyer who tweets? Smart.
- Culture + Intent = Word of Mouth
  - Heyming insists that it does not take a lot of time to offer fledgling startups his services, and his investment is quickly paid off once the companies get financing and he can start charging them like regular clients.
  - The reward he has earned from his work has far outweighed any risk he might encounter by spending resources on companies that may never fly. In fact, his larger paying clients, many of whom started out as small startups, generate 90 percent of his workload even though they make up only 30 percent of his client base. Some of his clients are venture capital funds, and they, too, recognize that it's in their best interest for Heyming to help grow their entrepreneurial community. Everybody wins: Troutman Sanders, which gives their attorneys free rein to build their practices as they see fit; Heyming, who gets to make money doing what he loves to do in a way that he loves to do it; the startups who just need a break; and the venture capitalists looking for their next investment opportunity.
- He succeeds because he doesn't draw lines in the sand when faced with the unfamiliar or unproven; he gets that at its core. Work is always about giving—efficiency, entertainment, relief, free time, peace of mind, opportunity, comfort—to other people; he cares deeply about his clients and recognizes that their success is his success. I think when Heyming describes the practice of law by saying "at base our practice is built around relationships," he could be talking about any field or industry, including yours.

#### Conclusion

- It's not your imagination; marketing really has gotten harder.
- The only way brands and businesses are going to be able to adapt to and overcome these challenges is by conducting a virtual door-to-door campaign to win over their customers' hearts and minds.
- ***That's a lot harder and more time-consuming than bombarding the market with a one-size-fits-all message. Yet those companies that are willing to get in the social media trenches with their customers will see that word of mouth can allow each individual engagement to have an impact hundreds of times greater than itself.***
- So what to do? As always, it's about hustle. Unfortunately, marketing has gotten harder at a time when many marketers have gotten softer. We've gotten used to running short sprints, not marathons, and we're not built for the endurance game.
- Social media allows you to get to know your customers well enough to gather a true idea of what their long-term value to your brand might be.
  - Plus, now that purchasing decisions are directly affected by consumers' relationships to the people they communicate with on their social networking sites, staying aware of who your consumers know and who they talk to regularly will become increasingly important.
  - Every interaction you engage in with them will have the potential to spread through their network via word of mouth. When businesses realize that they need to focus on investing in customers, not platforms, they will see amazing returns on that investment.
- Consumers are tired of being sold to. Op-ed article, blog post, positive consumer review goes a long way.

## PART IV Sawdust

- If you're a big brand like Coke or SunChips, your brand is being talked about and you need to address the topic head-on.
  - When you've got that conversation covered, you can spread out to talk more generally about beverages, refreshment, summer, et cetera.
  - **But if you're Sally's Orange Soda, no one is talking about you, so you need to do the reverse—create a general soda conversation first. You need to jump into every relevant conversation you spot, much like I did when I talked to people about Chardonnay and Shiraz in the early days.**
  - Once those conversations are up and running, you can start to talk specifically about Sally's Orange Soda.
- You'll pay attention to or interpret a comment about an NPR story from your mother or a coworker whom you respect far differently than you would if you found the article through a Google search.
  - That social context and connection gives the content weight and importance that it wouldn't otherwise have.
  - The difference between how people respond to search engine results or a banner ad versus how they respond to Twitter or Facebook feeds parallels the difference between how people respond to advertising and how they respond to word of mouth.
  - One is a random, faceless encounter that is easily forgotten; the other is a meaningful exchange worth passing along and sharing with others.

### How Fear Blocks Innovation

- It's becoming more unusual for a big consumer brand to really innovate and create a great product. Vitamin Water didn't come from Coke; Pom didn't come from Pepsi.
- Too many big companies get stuck in the muck of their own fear and short-term concerns, which prohibits them from taking risks and following through on great, creative thinking. They're too wrapped up in meetings and procedure and stock value, or worst of all, the politics of keeping their jobs, whereas smaller, scrappier companies are often still ruled by passion and have the freedom to experiment.
- ***There are a lot of people with a vested interest in making sure that brands don't start using social media. You can point out plenty of weaknesses in social media metrics, but you can find just as many in traditional media. The reality is, however, that brands will eventually be able to track every consumer online—there is no truer metric.***
  - What would happen if brands started demanding the same metric standard from traditional media?
  - What if they realize that they can spend their money more efficiently and effectively online than on television?
  - There is a lot of marketing and advertising money—not to mention thank-you-for-doing-business-with-us gifts like baseball-game tickets, shows, fancy dinners, trips to Cancún, and cases of Dom P—at stake, and a lot of people will denigrate social media's influence for as long as they can so they can keep their hands on it.
  - In addition, those gifts are often exchanged between people who genuinely like doing business together.

### Changing Strategies

- The world wars were fought with blanket fire—big planes dropping many bombs from the sky, battleships, tanks. Everything was big and meant to overwhelm the enemy.
- Then we got into Vietnam, and we couldn't use the same tactics—we had to fight one-on-one.
- More recently, in Iraq and Afghanistan, troops went from village to village, tribe to tribe, trying to stabilize dangerous regions all while winning the trust and the hearts and minds of the populace.
- There was a time in business when we had to fight big, and so it was necessary to rely on a big platform like television.
- Now that we are trying to go local, it's been a real struggle for some companies; big isn't going to help them win.
- Carpet-bombing Afghanistan wasn't going to get us anywhere, nor will spending $44 million exclusively on a TV campaign, some billboards, and radio spots.

### Drawing Lines in the Sand

- I think it's sad when someone who says he or she wants a fruitful career refuses to try something new because the numbers don't seem promising.
- I understand that people crave security, but I don't understand the complete lack of curiosity I sometimes see.
- Every time you draw a line in the sand, you're robbing yourself of a learning experience that could serve you well in the long run.

### The ROI of Emotions

- The ROI of a social media user is deeply tied to that user's sense of community and the emotional attachment he or she associates with a product.
- You could offer me a Jets T-shirt for eighty bucks and a Cowboys T-shirt for a dollar, and I would still never buy the Cowboys shirt.
- My emotional attachment to the Jets is that strong. A teenager who loves Vitamin Water enough to follow the brand on Facebook isn't going to be satisfied with a gift card from Snapple if Vitamin Water treats her better whenever she interacts with them online.
- She may be appreciative and grateful for the gift, but the second she has her own money she's going to spend it on the brand that means something to her.
  - The heart wants what the heart wants.
  - Snapple might get the initial purchase, but Vitamin Water has the relationship, which will translate into far greater revenue in the long run.
  - Those who are willing to look (and there are too many marketers who are not) are witnessing the humanization of business; it will have one of the greatest impacts on commerce we've ever seen.

### How Nielsen Ratings Work

- Ratings system: Selecting for demographics that best represent the country as a whole, a computer program randomly targets households with television sets and asks the inhabitants to monitor their television-watching habits.
  - Only about 50 percent of households agree to participate, so the ratings companies then have to try to replace the uncooperative homes with homes that best match the same demographic makeup.
  - In 2009, there were about 114,900,000 households with televisions. Of those households, only about 25,000 homes were monitored. That means 99.9 percent of American households were completely ignored. This is not necessarily news to the marketing, advertising, and media-buying community.
- The sample does get broader during the sweeps months of November, February, May, and July, when Nielsen asks about two million people to submit diaries. Paper diaries. Sent through the mail.
- You don't have to be a psychologist to think of any number of reasons why these diaries might not accurately reflect a person's TV-watching habits.
- Nielsen issued a 2010 report stating that 59 percent of people watch television and surf the Internet simultaneously, 35 percent more than the number of people who did so in 2009.

### What Touches People

- People laugh at me because I get so pumped about the New York Jets.
- Well, how is that any sillier than standing in line for nine hours to get the first copy of the newest book in the Twilight series? Or six hours for the new video game, Sneakers Smart Phone?
- Now that brands are touchable, there's no reason to think that with some creativity, they can't create the same emotions as a sports team or a pop culture event. The brand that touches and creates the most emotion wins.
- Campbell's knows this to be true. In a complete revamping of their marketing strategy, they are investing heavily in biometric tools—measuring skin moisture, heart rate, breath, and posture, for example—to help measure the subconscious, emotional reactions consumers have to their products. This research resulted in big changes to the look of their condensed soup cans, which they hope will evoke more emotional reactions from shoppers.

### The Broken Corporate Game

- The CEO of BP left with a multimillion-dollar bonus. He's in charge during the worst environmental disaster of all time, and he leaves with money spilling out of his pockets.
- When a leader's worst-case scenario doesn't look that bad, there's no reason that person should care desperately about the fate of his or her company.
- If that CEO's contract had said that the stock price needed to be at a certain level or he would lose everything, he would have treated the whole oil-well situation differently. When the worst-case scenario is pretty, you're never as scared or antsy as you should be. Period!
- Corporate America is rewarded for hookups and one-night stands, and that's how much respect most corporations show toward their customers. Don't hate the player; hate the game.
- ***Just to make it really, really clear: I am a fan of traditional media; I just have issues with the creative work and the pricing. I see what people are putting out there in print, on radio, and on TV, and I don't believe they are pushing the creative envelope enough.***
  - And, because of the massive changes in viewership, I don't think I should have to pay for this media as if it were still 1994 and radio, TV, and print were the only mediums getting people's attention.
- ***When you ask a consumer to fill out a survey or comment card, you've already influenced the answer you're going to get. As soon as people are asked for their opinion, they filter their replies.***
  - Maybe they're afraid of getting someone fired. Maybe they want to sound smart.
  - Maybe they don't want to hurt the feelings of the person asking the question. Maybe they are mean. But on social media, you're seeing people's unfiltered conversations, reactions, and opinions. That's a gold mine of information for the brand brave enough to look for it.
- ***Companies that resist the Thank You Economy are going to see an exodus of talent. The people who understand where the culture is going but don't get support from their companies are going to find the courage to leave for new pastures. In communist societies, people resist covertly. They're suppressed; they fight the system; and as soon as they can, they leave.***
- ***You can never lose by going out on a creative limb. Even if your campaign doesn't result in the sales you might have hoped for, your company culture will benefit from having tried. Talent wants to follow talent. Any creative team who sees that you tried something innovative will keep you in mind when they're ready to job hunt.***
- ***Put the best people in charge of social media, not the people you don't know what else to do with. Teams don't pick the chubby, out-of-shape guy first if they want to win; you shouldn't pick the second-rate player to do something that requires smarts, empathy, and flexibility.***
- ***There's still a perception that traditional media works—that people see it—and social media doesn't. What a lot of people fail to realize is how much traditional media is seen because of social media.***
  - The 2010 Grammys experienced a 35 percent hike in viewership since 2009, and was the most watched Grammys event since 2004.
  - Credit could be given to the stellar mainstream lineup, or an increase in country fans, or various promotions, but I'm sure social media had something to do with it, too. When Pink started spinning, wet and nearly naked, in a Cirque du Soleil–style harness while singing "Glitter in the Sky," Twitter went nuts, leading people to think, "Huh, maybe I should tune in."


### The Biggest Mistakes Companies Make with Social Media

1. Using tactics instead of strategy
2. Using it exclusively to put out fires
3. Using it to brag
4. Using it as a press release
5. Exclusively re-tweeting other people's material rather than creating your own original content
6. Using it to push product
7. Expecting immediate results

- Facebook is not the only significant social media platform, but many people think they have to fish in the big ocean and ignore the pond. The ponds are rich sources of revenue.
- Before we launched Vaynermedia, AJ and I were going to start a fantasy sports site. Had we chosen that path, we probably would have spent much of our money on Facebook ads, but we also would have spent countless hours engaging in the fifty most prominent fantasy sports blogs and forums.
- They wouldn't have had as many eyeballs as Facebook, but those eyeballs would have been a committed, dedicated potential audience. It is time for companies to allocate to the ponds some of the money they're pouring into the big oceans.

### Why Big Companies Focus on Big Platforms

- Right now in big companies there are four people or perhaps six people on staff making decisions with a $40 million budget.
- It's going to take a lot more people. You can't have just one person flying a plane and dropping sixty bombs; you need a lot of people on the ground going one-on-one. Businesses have to quit outsourcing everything and start building up their internal teams around these new platforms.

## PART V How to Win in the Thank You Economy, the Quick Version

- Care—about your customers, about your employees, about your brand—with everything you've got.
- Erase any lines in the sand—don't be afraid of what's new or unfamiliar.
- Show up first to market whenever possible, early the rest of the time.
- Instill a culture of caring into your business by:
  - Being self-aware
  - Mentally committing to change
  - Setting the tone through your words and actions
  - Investing in your employees
  - Hiring culturally compatible DNA, and spotting it within your existing team
  - Being authentic—whether online or offline, say what you mean, and mean what you say
  - Empowering your people to be forthright, creative, and generous
- Remember that behind every B2B transaction, there is a C.
- Speak your customers' language.
- Allow your customers to help you shape your brand or business, but never allow them to dictate the direction in which you take it.
- Build a sense of community around your brand.
- Arrange for traditional and social media to play Ping-Pong and extend every conversation.
- Direct all of your marketing initiatives toward the emotional center, and to the creative extremes.
- Approach social media initiatives with good intent, aiming for quality engagements, not quantity.
- Use shock and awe to blow your customers' minds and get them talking.
- If you must use tactics, use "pull" tactics that remind consumers why they should care about your brand.
- If you're small, play like you're big; if you're big, play like you're small.
- Create a sense of community around your business or your brand.
- Don't be afraid to crawl before you run.


## Notes

- I'm not a huge fan of SEO, and I think its value as a brand awareness tool is going to weaken as platforms develop that leverage the relationship between a business or brand and an information seeker.
- Remember the kid I watched in Best Buy who used a status update to get the information he needed from his friends to pick a video game.
- The only people who have to fear low numbers are those who have artificially inflated their value and popularity.
- The excessive attention we pay to squeaky wheels is contributing to a lot of misses right now. I know I was guilty of doing it when I was getting started with social media. We need to make sure that we focus on the emerging advocates for our brands, especially micro-celebrities, and not get overwhelmed by the small percentage of problems we sometimes have to handle.
- When I saw the ads and heard about the campaign, I respected the hustle it took to put the whole thing together, but it didn't occur to me to run out to buy a stick of Old Spice. Rather, I walked into the pharmacy to buy something else, saw Old Spice on the shelf, remembered how much I'd liked the videos, and decided to give the product a try.
- Unfortunately, it's going to be a lot harder for social media campaigns to attract earned media by 2012 or so, once the public has become used to communicating directly with brands. As with almost all attention-grabbing efforts, you have to constantly reinvent and top yourself to make an impact.
- If you are in the restaurant business and you are not obsessed with your Yelp strategy, please sell your establishment now while there's still some value in your business.
- Just how much information are we trying to absorb? At the 2010 Techonomy conference in Lake Tahoe, California, Google CEO Eric Schmidt stated that every two days people create as much information as they did from the dawn of civilization to 2003, about five exabytes of data.
