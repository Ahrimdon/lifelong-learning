# Die Empty: Unleash Your Best Work Every Day

## 1: Die Empty

- "Before I die, I want to ..." really resonates with people.
- To avoid "Who am I, how did I get here, and how do I go back?", you need to instill consistent practices into your life that keep you on a true and steady course.
- ***The most valuable land in the world is the graveyard. In the graveyard are buried all of the unwritten novels, never-launched businesses, unreconciled relationships, and all of the other things that people thought, ‘I’ll get around to that tomorrow.’ One day, however, their tomorrows ran out.”***
- "Die Empty": I wan to know if I lay my head down tonight and don't wake up tomorrow, I have emptied myself of whatever creativity is lingering inside, with minimal regrets about how I spent my focus, time, and energy. THIS IS AN INTENTIONAL AND SUSTAINED EFFORT.
- "No one every lay on their deathbed wishing for another day of work." is wrong.
  - A great many people do regret not having treated their life with more purpose, and would give anything to have one more chance to approach is with the kind of intention and conviction that imminent death makes palpable. They know that they consistently ignored small twinges of intuition, inspiration, and insight. They recall how they cowered away from risk in favor of comfort. They spent their days regretting their past decisions rather than taking aggressive steps to redirect their life in a more hopeful decision.
  - It's implied that work is an inherently miserable act that people engage in against their will, or that it's something that necessarily pulls us away from the people and activities we really care about.
  - Work is not just how we make a living. Any value we create that requires us to spend our time, focus, and energy, is work.
  - I believe that the more you apply self-knowledge to how to engage your labor, the more satisfaction you will find in the very act of work.
- It's not about getting everything done today. It's about making steady, critical progress every day on the projects that matter, in all areas of life.
- Still need responsibility.
- Make sure you are delivering on your expectations and honoring the people who are paying you to produce results.

### What Die Empty Does Mean

- **Your days are numbered, and someday they will run out.** We need to live with a sense of urgency about the work we do today. The way we engage in our work ultimately affects the way that we engage in our life as a whole.
- **You have a unique contribution to make to the world.** If you don't do what you think you are meant to do, you'll always wonder, "what if?" The price of regret is incalculable.
- **No one else can make your contribution for you.** Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. No pointing fingers, blaming others, or complaining. Unfairness is baked into every aspect of life. To make a contribution, you have to come to terms with it and refuse to be a victim.
- **Your contribution is not about you.** You cannot function solely out of a desire to be recognized for what you do. Cultivate a love of the process, not the celebrity behind it.
- **Avoid comfort, it is dangerous.** There are some people, whether co-workers, managers, or even friends, that may not want you to fully engage in the pursuit of great work because it places an onus on them to do the same. Some organizations also provide you "the golden handcuffs". It's easy to fall in love with these comfortable perks, but the love of comfort is often the enemy of greatness.
- **Take a stand.** Align your work around your values. Commit to engaging your work with a clean conscience, knowing that you are holding true to those principles. There is plenty of room to experiment and try new things.
- **The understanding of the sweet spot develops over time, like film in a darkroom.** The opportunities only become clear over time as you act. They develop slowly, giving you clues as you experiment, fail, and succeed.
- **You must plant seeds today fora harvest later.** Structure your life around daily progress based on what matters to you, building practices and activities that allow you to plant new seeds every day, with the knowledge that you will eventually see the fruits of your labor.

### 2: Your Contribution

#### Principle: Your body of work should reflect what's important to you.

- How much of your day do you spend doing work that you'll be proud of later?
- "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."
- “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.” - Steve Jobs.
- ***Brilliant work is forged by those who consistently approach their days with urgency and diligence.***
- Urgency means leveraging your finite resources in a meaningful and productive way. Diligence means sharpening your skills and conducting your work in a manner that you won't regret later. When you adopt the mindset of urgent diligence, you'll pour all of who you are into your days, and subsequently, you'll find that the unique value you bring to the world comes more clearly into focus.
- ***The great problems we see in the world today will not be solved by people functioning at half capacity, cranking out work they don't care about in order to buy more things that will eventually rust or rot. These problems will be solved by people who have tapped into their deeper aptitudes and who are pouring themselves fully into work that's meaningful to them and valuable to others.***
- While there is an increasing expectation across all sectors for both creativity and productivity, in many workplaces, creativity is frequently subverted due to the increasing pressure to get work done.
- Most of us choose getting the job done versus doing work we're proud of.

#### Your Body of Work

- This isn't your occupation, but this is any way in which you contribute value to the world using your available resources. This includes every task you do and project you engage in, but also every time you encourage someone else or contribute to a relationship, the times you make an effort to grow your skills, or every time you go the extra mile even though you are exhausted.
- Your body of work comprises the sum total of where you choose to place your limited focus, assets, time, and energy.
- Forget about your title, pay grade. The only way to effectively gauge my work is to answer the question, "Can I lay my head down satisfied with the work I did today?"
- Are you checking off the most important items off the list?
- ***The key to long-term success is a willingness to disrupt your own comfort for the sake of continued growth.***
- How you choose to stare down uncertainty is often the determinant of success or failure. You can either operate by design, or you operate by default, doing what seems comfortable.

#### The Three Kinds of Work

- "Ought there not be an increment, earned though not yet received, from one's daily work, an accomplishment of man's being?"
- **Mapping:** Planning, plotting your objectives, and setting priorities.
  - No mapping: Drifter. He enjoys the process of making, loves to develop his skills and engage his curiosity, but is a poor planner. As a result, he bounces from project to project and goes wherever his latest whim carries him.

- **Making:** Actually doing the work. Creating value of any kind. The most tactical, and the area where it's easiest to get distracted. There are more moving parts and decisions with immediate impact, and thus more opportunities for things to go awry.
  - No making: Dreamer. A talker, and rarely accomplishes much.

- **Meshing:** The work between the work that actually makes you effective.
  - No meshing: Driver. Obsessed with results, but does little to increase his platform for future effectiveness. As a result, he becomes narrowly effective and is often unable to spot or take advantage of opportunities if they are outside his immediate area of focus.

- All three: **Developer.** He is constantly weaving together available resources and opportunities to create value. He doesn't do work frantically, but instead works with urgency and diligence, making plans and then executing them, learning from this actions, and then redirecting as needed.
- You are building a body of work today through about what you have to do and how you do it. Whether or not your body is recognized for recognized for its true value is beyond your control.

### 3: The Siren Song of Mediocrity.

#### Principle: Mediocrity doesn't just happen suddenly; it develops slowly over time.

- "I'm still doing my work, but I don't get the same level of satisfaction I once did. I'm making progress, but I don't feel like I'm making important progress."
- Satisficing: Satisfy and suffice. We settle for the best available option that meets most of our requirements.
- No one charts a course for mediocrity. No one wants to file papers all day long.
- Mediocrity: settling in and succumbing to stasis. Literally translated, it means to settle halfway to the summit of a difficult mountain.
- People who are successful over the long arc refused to allow circumstances to define their engagement. They continue to grow, develop new skills, and seek unanticipated opportunities to use their skills and create value.

#### Seven Deadly Sins of Mediocrity

- **Aimlessness.** Give me a bow and arrow, ask me to shoot a target. Where the hell should I shoot this if I don't know where the target is? Even if I did hit the target accidentally, there would be little joy for me because it would be the result of chance and not due to strategic effort. There is little gratification in unintentional success. Without a clear strategy or metric for success, I would eventually become weary from trying to hit the target, and I would conclude that my actions lack any kind of meaningful purpose.
- ***The key to conquering aimlessness is to concretely define the battles that you need to fight every day in order to make meaningful progress, then focus on those efforts above all else.***

- **Boredom.** Often a sign that you're poised for a breakthrough in your work. This means your mind has grown weary of the rut you're in and is ready to jump the tracks and try something new.
- ***The cure for boredom is intentional and applied curiosity. To be successful intellectually and professionally, you need to maintain a level of disciplined curiosity, which means staying in touch with your deeper questions, and practicing the mechanics of divergent problem solving.***

- **Comfort.** The love of comfort is frequently the enemy of greatness. When comfort becomes the goal of life, we cannibalize future progress for the sake of temporary stability.
- ***The key to overcoming the love of comfort is a commitment to continual growth and skill development.*** To avoid stagnation, you must identify relevant skills that will help you continue to contribute, build practices into your life to help you develop them, and have frequent checkpoints through which you gauge your progress and redirect as necessary.

- **Delusion.** You need to cultivate self-awareness. You must have an accurate sense of your skills, your weaknesses, and you core drivers. Then, orient your daily activity around that self-knowledge.

- **Ego.** Adopt a posture of adaptability. Be in a state of continual learning and openness to correction.

- **Fear.** To fight fear, instill a practice of strategic, intentional, and purpose risk-taking in your life and work.

- **Guardedness.** Not thinking of the context/community of your work. The solution to guardedness is to build a system of checks into your life to help you scan for relational outages.
