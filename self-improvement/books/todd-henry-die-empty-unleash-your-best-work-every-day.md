# Die Empty: Unleash Your Best Work Every Day

## 1: Die Empty

- "Before I die, I want to ..." really resonates with people.
- To avoid "Who am I, how did I get here, and how do I go back?", you need to instill consistent practices into your life that keep you on a true and steady course.
- ***The most valuable land in the world is the graveyard. In the graveyard are buried all of the unwritten novels, never-launched businesses, unreconciled relationships, and all of the other things that people thought, ‘I’ll get around to that tomorrow.’ One day, however, their tomorrows ran out.”***
- "Die Empty": I wan to know if I lay my head down tonight and don't wake up tomorrow, I have emptied myself of whatever creativity is lingering inside, with minimal regrets about how I spent my focus, time, and energy. THIS IS AN INTENTIONAL AND SUSTAINED EFFORT.
- "No one every lay on their deathbed wishing for another day of work." is wrong.
  - A great many people do regret not having treated their life with more purpose, and would give anything to have one more chance to approach is with the kind of intention and conviction that imminent death makes palpable. They know that they consistently ignored small twinges of intuition, inspiration, and insight. They recall how they cowered away from risk in favor of comfort. They spent their days regretting their past decisions rather than taking aggressive steps to redirect their life in a more hopeful decision.
  - It's implied that work is an inherently miserable act that people engage in against their will, or that it's something that necessarily pulls us away from the people and activities we really care about.
  - Work is not just how we make a living. Any value we create that requires us to spend our time, focus, and energy, is work.
  - I believe that the more you apply self-knowledge to how to engage your labor, the more satisfaction you will find in the very act of work.
- It's not about getting everything done today. It's about making steady, critical progress every day on the projects that matter, in all areas of life.
- Still need responsibility.
- Make sure you are delivering on your expectations and honoring the people who are paying you to produce results.

### What Die Empty Does Mean

- **Your days are numbered, and someday they will run out.** We need to live with a sense of urgency about the work we do today. The way we engage in our work ultimately affects the way that we engage in our life as a whole.
- **You have a unique contribution to make to the world.** If you don't do what you think you are meant to do, you'll always wonder, "what if?" The price of regret is incalculable.
- **No one else can make your contribution for you.** Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. No pointing fingers, blaming others, or complaining. Unfairness is baked into every aspect of life. To make a contribution, you have to come to terms with it and refuse to be a victim.
- **Your contribution is not about you.** You cannot function solely out of a desire to be recognized for what you do. Cultivate a love of the process, not the celebrity behind it.
- **Avoid comfort, it is dangerous.** There are some people, whether co-workers, managers, or even friends, that may not want you to fully engage in the pursuit of great work because it places an onus on them to do the same. Some organizations also provide you "the golden handcuffs". It's easy to fall in love with these comfortable perks, but the love of comfort is often the enemy of greatness.
- **Take a stand.** Align your work around your values. Commit to engaging your work with a clean conscience, knowing that you are holding true to those principles. There is plenty of room to experiment and try new things.
- **The understanding of the sweet spot develops over time, like film in a darkroom.** The opportunities only become clear over time as you act. They develop slowly, giving you clues as you experiment, fail, and succeed.
- **You must plant seeds today fora harvest later.** Structure your life around daily progress based on what matters to you, building practices and activities that allow you to plant new seeds every day, with the knowledge that you will eventually see the fruits of your labor.

### 2: Your Contribution

#### Principle: Your body of work should reflect what's important to you.

- How much of your day do you spend doing work that you'll be proud of later?
- "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."
- “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.” - Steve Jobs.
- ***Brilliant work is forged by those who consistently approach their days with urgency and diligence.***
- Urgency means leveraging your finite resources in a meaningful and productive way. Diligence means sharpening your skills and conducting your work in a manner that you won't regret later. When you adopt the mindset of urgent diligence, you'll pour all of who you are into your days, and subsequently, you'll find that the unique value you bring to the world comes more clearly into focus.
- ***The great problems we see in the world today will not be solved by people functioning at half capacity, cranking out work they don't care about in order to buy more things that will eventually rust or rot. These problems will be solved by people who have tapped into their deeper aptitudes and who are pouring themselves fully into work that's meaningful to them and valuable to others.***
- While there is an increasing expectation across all sectors for both creativity and productivity, in many workplaces, creativity is frequently subverted due to the increasing pressure to get work done.
- Most of us choose getting the job done versus doing work we're proud of.

#### Your Body of Work

- This isn't your occupation, but this is any way in which you contribute value to the world using your available resources. This includes every task you do and project you engage in, but also every time you encourage someone else or contribute to a relationship, the times you make an effort to grow your skills, or every time you go the extra mile even though you are exhausted.
- Your body of work comprises the sum total of where you choose to place your limited focus, assets, time, and energy.
- Forget about your title, pay grade. The only way to effectively gauge my work is to answer the question, "Can I lay my head down satisfied with the work I did today?"
- Are you checking off the most important items off the list?
- ***The key to long-term success is a willingness to disrupt your own comfort for the sake of continued growth.***
- How you choose to stare down uncertainty is often the determinant of success or failure. You can either operate by design, or you operate by default, doing what seems comfortable.

#### The Three Kinds of Work

- "Ought there not be an increment, earned though not yet received, from one's daily work, an accomplishment of man's being?"
- **Mapping:** Planning, plotting your objectives, and setting priorities.
  - No mapping: Drifter. He enjoys the process of making, loves to develop his skills and engage his curiosity, but is a poor planner. As a result, he bounces from project to project and goes wherever his latest whim carries him.

- **Making:** Actually doing the work. Creating value of any kind. The most tactical, and the area where it's easiest to get distracted. There are more moving parts and decisions with immediate impact, and thus more opportunities for things to go awry.
  - No making: Dreamer. A talker, and rarely accomplishes much.

- **Meshing:** The work between the work that actually makes you effective.
  - No meshing: Driver. Obsessed with results, but does little to increase his platform for future effectiveness. As a result, he becomes narrowly effective and is often unable to spot or take advantage of opportunities if they are outside his immediate area of focus.

- All three: **Developer.** He is constantly weaving together available resources and opportunities to create value. He doesn't do work frantically, but instead works with urgency and diligence, making plans and then executing them, learning from this actions, and then redirecting as needed.
- You are building a body of work today through about what you have to do and how you do it. Whether or not your body is recognized for recognized for its true value is beyond your control.

### 3: The Siren Song of Mediocrity.

#### Principle: Mediocrity doesn't just happen suddenly; it develops slowly over time.

- "I'm still doing my work, but I don't get the same level of satisfaction I once did. I'm making progress, but I don't feel like I'm making important progress."
- Satisficing: Satisfy and suffice. We settle for the best available option that meets most of our requirements.
- No one charts a course for mediocrity. No one wants to file papers all day long.
- Mediocrity: settling in and succumbing to stasis. Literally translated, it means to settle halfway to the summit of a difficult mountain.
- People who are successful over the long arc refused to allow circumstances to define their engagement. They continue to grow, develop new skills, and seek unanticipated opportunities to use their skills and create value.

#### Seven Deadly Sins of Mediocrity

- **Aimlessness.** Give me a bow and arrow, ask me to shoot a target. Where the hell should I shoot this if I don't know where the target is? Even if I did hit the target accidentally, there would be little joy for me because it would be the result of chance and not due to strategic effort. There is little gratification in unintentional success. Without a clear strategy or metric for success, I would eventually become weary from trying to hit the target, and I would conclude that my actions lack any kind of meaningful purpose.
- ***The key to conquering aimlessness is to concretely define the battles that you need to fight every day in order to make meaningful progress, then focus on those efforts above all else.***

- **Boredom.** Often a sign that you're poised for a breakthrough in your work. This means your mind has grown weary of the rut you're in and is ready to jump the tracks and try something new.
- ***The cure for boredom is intentional and applied curiosity. To be successful intellectually and professionally, you need to maintain a level of disciplined curiosity, which means staying in touch with your deeper questions, and practicing the mechanics of divergent problem solving.***

- **Comfort.** The love of comfort is frequently the enemy of greatness. When comfort becomes the goal of life, we cannibalize future progress for the sake of temporary stability.
- ***The key to overcoming the love of comfort is a commitment to continual growth and skill development.*** To avoid stagnation, you must identify relevant skills that will help you continue to contribute, build practices into your life to help you develop them, and have frequent checkpoints through which you gauge your progress and redirect as necessary.

- **Delusion.** You need to cultivate self-awareness. You must have an accurate sense of your skills, your weaknesses, and you core drivers. Then, orient your daily activity around that self-knowledge.

- **Ego.** Adopt a posture of adaptability. Be in a state of continual learning and openness to correction.

- **Fear.** To fight fear, instill a practice of strategic, intentional, and purpose risk-taking in your life and work.

- **Guardedness.** Not thinking of the context/community of your work. The solution to guardedness is to build a system of checks into your life to help you scan for relational outages.

## 4: Define Your Battles

### Principle: To counter aimlessness, you must define your battles wisely, and build your life around them.

- While big, long drives are impressive, they aren't necessarily going to help me achieve my objective, a better golf score.
- Progress is often made through one's willingness to persist at the small activities no one else sees, but that truly generates results.
- ***Through line: the theme of your life and work, the thesis statement.***
- People sell their souls by running away from the battles they know they should be fighting.
- Having a lens through which to view your efforts and gauge your progress will increase your likelihood of creating a body of work you will be proud of, even if that lens adapts and changes over time.
- Passion: root word means "suffering". Great work means suffering for something beyond yourself.
- ***Productive passion: the sort of passion that motivates you and is also beneficial to others.*** Others-focused, not self-focused.
- Compassionate anger.
  - What dynamics in the marketplace do you see that cause you to feel a desire to step in on behalf of those who are suffering in order to bear part of their burden or rectify a wrong?
- Obsession: Passion followed action, not the other way around.

### Welcome to the Battle

- Priorities: Some people fall into aimlessness because they don't like the discomfort of having to say not to the very good things that aren't the most important things. They'd rather be mediocre at a lot of things than take a real swing at things they care about and risk failure.
- What will you stand for today?
  - What will you refuse to compromise on, no matter what?
  - What will define your terms of engagement?
  - Boca Restaurant Group: "Blow People Away."
- What do you know you should be doing, but have been ignoring?
  - These are forgotten battlefronts. They are things that have been weighing on your mind for a while now, and things that you care deeply about, but you've been ignoring.
  - **Action defines reality, and "potential" is nothing but unproven, hypothetical value.**
- What are your open loops? These are the unfinished projects, the halfhearted efforts, or the unreconciled relationships. These are projects you're afraid to say no to, but deep down you know that you can't commit to.
- ***To avoid aimlessness, you have to stand for something. Don't allow aimlessness to rob you of years of your life. You will ultimately be remembered for-and your body of work will be built upon-the battles you choose to spend your time fighting.***

## 5: Be Fiercely Curious

### Principle: To prevent boredom from dulling your senses, you must approach your work with a curious mindset.

- All great feats begin with: "Why? How? What if?".
- "Busily bored": not stretching their mind, not acknowledging their deeper questions, not trying out new things, living with unchecked, limiting assumptions.
- **Reclaim curiosity by embracing an engaging mindset rather than an entertainment mindset. This means dedicating yourself to the pursuit of new and better questions.**
- The best ideas often occur in the spaces in between commitments. They usually materialize in the moments of downtime, and when I was doing something no way related to the project.
- Technology: broadens our familiarity with what's happening in the world, but it has the side effect of having just shallow knowledge about things. We often don't take time to stop and consider how what we're seeing or experiencing fits into the wider scheme of life, because there's always something new to move on to.
- **Some people will never learn anything, because they understand everything too soon.** Alexander Pope
- When you become more selective about what you spend your valuable attention, you cultivate the capacity to notice the subtleties of life and apply new observations to your work.
- Creative block: our well of stimuli is dry. The creative process involves combining multiple bits of stimuli in our environment into something new. When we are inverted, we have fewer options to smash together because we've not been spending enough time seeking inspiration or we need to spend more time processing our experiences to mine them for potentially useful insights.
- To avoid becoming one of the busily bored, you need to stoke the fires of your curiosity by addressing its two forms: specific (diving deep into topics of interest) and diversive (exploring possibilities through purposeful questioning).

#### Establishing Hunting Trails

- You must establish parcels of structured curiosity in your life, which means setting aside time and giving yourself permission to stoke the fire of your curiosity in a way that doesn't interfere with your more urgent work.
  - ***Keep a list of questions.*** When was the last time you pondered a question that wasn't directly related to driving immediate results? Are you paying attention to those little moments of "Huh?" and "Why?" that crop up throughout the day?
  - Give yourself permission to not know things. The appearance of wisdom is not the same thing as possessing it, and people who seek wisdom are not threatened by new or disconfirming information.
  - Before going into a meeting, take a few minutes to consider the questions you're hoping to address through the experience.
  - "A commonplace book": a collection of quotes, recipes, or other items centered around a theme, and designed to help its creator recall important information.
  - "The List": a list of must-read books or articles. Work your way through those lists.
- **Dedicate time to pursue your questions.** A list of the interesting books, films, or articles that I come across throughout the day and I want to revisit later, during my study time.
- **Prototype relentlessly.**
- **Find your bliss station.** This is the place where I do my life's work.
- Having a sacred space in your life:  You must have a room, a certain hour or so a day, where you don't know what was in the newspapers that morning, you don't know who your friends are... This is a place where you can simply experience and bring forth what you are and what you might be. This is the place of creative incubation.
- **My life's work certainly is not encapsulated by the work I do building a business. It's much more than that. It's the space I occupy in the lives of others I live to serve, including family and friends. It's the discovery of my own self. All this work in private then feeds the work I do in every corner of my life, like a tributary flowing into a raging river."

#### Develop Possibility Thinking

- This means refusing to settle for status quo ideas and instead, relentlessly embracing the pursuit of great ones.
- When you have clear boundaries to work within, you can feel more comfortable asking extremely divergent questions and exploring initially irrelevant-seeming possibilities.

#### Redefining the Problem

- **Aspirations.** "What does this want to become? What would be the ultimate end, if we were to perfectly solve this problem?" Consider a current project you're working on, and ask yourself what the project is aspiring to become.
- **Affinities.** These are similarities you notice between the project you're working on and other experiences you've had. "What is this problem or project like?" "Where have I seen something similar before?" "Can I see any patterns here?" Compare your current difficulty with products on the market, people, circumstances, ideas, or anything at all that you can use to glean patterns of similarity. "How is this like..." and write down all the similarities you note.
- **Assumptions.** "What assumptions might I be making about this?"
- **Attributes.** "What are the specific, concrete words you would use to describe the problem?

## 6: Step Out of Your Comfort Zone

### Principle: To make a valuable contribution, you have to get uncomfortable and embrace lifelong growth and skill development.

- Sarah Peck: swam from Alcatraz to San Francisco naked.
- People will rally behind you if you're consistent. If you're reliable. Even if it's crazy, if they can't trust you. Do something, and then hustle like crazy to make it happen.
- If you want to avoid the path that leads to apathy and mediocrity, at some point you are going to have to step outside your comfort zone.
- We are biologically wired to stay within the comfort zone.
- You have to do the best you can, even when nobody's watching you. That's the best way to make yourself invaluable to your team and to ensure that you continue to grow.
- Instead of "imagine if it's your last day", think "imagine if you have a guest accompanying you throughout your day tomorrow." That guest will then write about your day.
  - If that was the definitive record of your life, how would you feel about it?
  - You'd probably get up a little earlier, be kinder, be more meticulous, call up friends, wrap up your loose ends.
  - "How does your imagined behavior compare with how you are actually living your life today?" We act differently when we know we are being recorded because we go outside our comfort zone and do what we know to be right, rather than what feels to be right in the moment. It forces us to act, rather than defer action.
- **We live with the stubborn illusion that we will always have tomorrow to do today's work. We hold on to this belief like a pacifier to help us ignore the uncertainty and the weight of all that's left to do.** When we consider what it would be like to have our work on display, we remember that it is our actions that define us, not our intentions.

- As far as work is concerned, experts who were happiest about their careers can point to a decision where they were tempted to say no, but they did things anyway.
- People who took risks at critical junctures were those who looked back with the greatest satisfaction on their work lives.
- For many of the most successful elders, the "say yes" attitude formed their core approach to work. For others, missed opportunities provided a serious source of regret near the end of their lives.

- No:
  - Fear of harm. The safety we seek is most often an illusion anyway, because true safety is rarely a viable option.
  - Identity protection.
  - Love of stability. The more there is to protect, the less some people are willing to try new things. Are you gravitating toward stability at the expense of great work?
  - Ego. "No" is sometimes a form of ego, or wanting to impose our will on the world, which often means a willingness to stand by a poor choice just to remain in control.

- "If I do this enough times in a row, I will keep stretching myself out of my comfort zone, and I will eventually make something worthwhile."
- Being in uncomfortable environments taught me to rely on and trust my instincts, and to leverage aptitudes that I'd forgotten about.
- When you're forced to use every skill at your disposal to add value, it makes you a better employee.
- Jeff Bezos and the "Regret Minimization Framework": he imagined himself at 80, and considered how he would feel about each decision.

- Many people in today's marketplace are waiting for permission to act on their intuition. "Excellence isn't about working extra hard to do what you're told. It's about taking the initiative to do work you decide is worth doing."
- "This is a revolutionary overthrow of time and motion studies, of foremen, of bureaucracies and bosses. It's not a new flavor of the old soup. It's a personal, urgent, this-is-my-call way to do your job. Please stop waiting for a map. We reward those who draw maps, not those who follow them."
- Mapmakers are those who can effectively circumnavigate constraints in order to make things happen. We all deal with constraints in order to make things happen.
- Where in your life and work are you waiting for permission? Don't anticipate that someone is going to hand you a map. You'll probably have to make your own.

- "If you could snap your fingers right now and make anything happen in your job, what would it be?"
  - Contingency: People who feel that they are being constrained by something, and they wish those constraints would disappear so they can shine in their role.
  - Ownership: They hold a sense of personal responsibility for the future trajectory of their career. A desire for better understanding of of how the company functions, or a greater grasp of organizational priorities.

- Goals: Daily, biweekly, and long-term.
  - Step goal: What do I do today, no matter what? Accomplishing a stretch goal is less a linear march to the finish line that it is a series of combustive battles.
    - Jerry Seinfeld kept a giant wall calendar, and he would mark a big red X on the days when he wrote jokes. After a few days, he'd created a chain. The longer the chain got, the harder it was to break. Don't break the chain.
    - Did we move closer to what we want to achieve?
  - Sprint goal a la software development sprint: intermediate goal that can be done in 2 weeks.
  - Stretch goal: What's the change?
    - It must be something you can control and measure. If you can't control it, you can't plan for it.
    - Business/work (skills/context for your work), mental (developing intellectual capacity/ability to process info), relational, personal/spiritual (physical health/emotional growth/self-awareness/personal skill development).

- Steps:
  - ***Survey your life for growth opportunities.*** Identify a few skills that you could develop that would make you more effective in your work. Remember, work is any place you add value, so no just your job. Think of places where your actions have an impact.
  - ***Define your objectives.*** Set a stretch goal. What is your objective today? How will you know that today was a success? What great battle must be fought in order for you to know that you have accomplished something that moves you toward your long-arc objective?
  - ***Define what you're willing to give up in order to accomplish it.*** Everything in life is a trade-off. If you want to do work that causes you to spend yourself, then by definition you cannot do that without cost. Determine in advance, what are you willing to sacrifice?
  - ***Draw the battle lines.*** What "enemy" will you have to overcome in order to accomplish your goal, and how will you prepare for it?
  - ***Redirect and reassess.*** Failure doesn't always mean defeat; it only means that you fell short of accomplishing your objective. Keep a daily record of learning and new insights that might help you tomorrow.

- Ben Franklin:
  - Morning question: "What good shall I do this day?"
  - Evening question: "What good have I done today?
- Make it actual goals, not wishful thinking.
- Your vector: why don't you start now?
  - "I'm fifty years old, it'll take me five years to learn to play well. I'd be fifty-five by the time I become even remotely proficient as a pianist."
  - "So, how old will you be in five years if you DON'T learn to play the piano?
- ***If you're honest with yourself, you probably already know where you are falling short or playing it safe. You cannot chase safety and count on emptying yourself of your best work. You cannot pursue greatness and comfort at the same time.***
