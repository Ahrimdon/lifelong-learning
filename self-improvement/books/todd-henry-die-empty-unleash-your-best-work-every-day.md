# Die Empty: Unleash Your Best Work Every Day

## 1: Die Empty

- "Before I die, I want to ..." really resonates with people.
- To avoid "Who am I, how did I get here, and how do I go back?", you need to instill consistent practices into your life that keep you on a true and steady course.
- ***The most valuable land in the world is the graveyard. In the graveyard are buried all of the unwritten novels, never-launched businesses, unreconciled relationships, and all of the other things that people thought, ‘I’ll get around to that tomorrow.’ One day, however, their tomorrows ran out.”***
- "Die Empty": I wan to know if I lay my head down tonight and don't wake up tomorrow, I have emptied myself of whatever creativity is lingering inside, with minimal regrets about how I spent my focus, time, and energy. THIS IS AN INTENTIONAL AND SUSTAINED EFFORT.
- "No one every lay on their deathbed wishing for another day of work." is wrong.
  - A great many people do regret not having treated their life with more purpose, and would give anything to have one more chance to approach is with the kind of intention and conviction that imminent death makes palpable. They know that they consistently ignored small twinges of intuition, inspiration, and insight. They recall how they cowered away from risk in favor of comfort. They spent their days regretting their past decisions rather than taking aggressive steps to redirect their life in a more hopeful decision.
  - It's implied that work is an inherently miserable act that people engage in against their will, or that it's something that necessarily pulls us away from the people and activities we really care about.
  - Work is not just how we make a living. Any value we create that requires us to spend our time, focus, and energy, is work.
  - I believe that the more you apply self-knowledge to how to engage your labor, the more satisfaction you will find in the very act of work.
- It's not about getting everything done today. It's about making steady, critical progress every day on the projects that matter, in all areas of life.
- Still need responsibility.
- Make sure you are delivering on your expectations and honoring the people who are paying you to produce results.

### What Die Empty Does Mean

- **Your days are numbered, and someday they will run out.** We need to live with a sense of urgency about the work we do today. The way we engage in our work ultimately affects the way that we engage in our life as a whole.
- **You have a unique contribution to make to the world.** If you don't do what you think you are meant to do, you'll always wonder, "what if?" The price of regret is incalculable.
- **No one else can make your contribution for you.** Everyone plays the hand they're dealt. No pointing fingers, blaming others, or complaining. Unfairness is baked into every aspect of life. To make a contribution, you have to come to terms with it and refuse to be a victim.
- **Your contribution is not about you.** You cannot function solely out of a desire to be recognized for what you do. Cultivate a love of the process, not the celebrity behind it.
- **Avoid comfort, it is dangerous.** There are some people, whether co-workers, managers, or even friends, that may not want you to fully engage in the pursuit of great work because it places an onus on them to do the same. Some organizations also provide you "the golden handcuffs". It's easy to fall in love with these comfortable perks, but the love of comfort is often the enemy of greatness.
- **Take a stand.** Align your work around your values. Commit to engaging your work with a clean conscience, knowing that you are holding true to those principles. There is plenty of room to experiment and try new things.
- **The understanding of the sweet spot develops over time, like film in a darkroom.** The opportunities only become clear over time as you act. They develop slowly, giving you clues as you experiment, fail, and succeed.
- **You must plant seeds today fora harvest later.** Structure your life around daily progress based on what matters to you, building practices and activities that allow you to plant new seeds every day, with the knowledge that you will eventually see the fruits of your labor.
