# Why Nations Fail

# Preface

- Egypt: Economic problems are caused by lack of political rights. An ineffective/corrupt state and a society where they cannot use their talent, ambition, ingenuity, and education. Political power exercises/monopolized by a narrow elite.
- Agriculture, culture (work ethic/cultural traits/religion), rulers.
- Countries such as the UK and US became rich because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power and created a society where political rights were more broadly distributed/government was accountable to citizens.

# So Close and Yet So Different

- Nogales, Sonora vs Nogales, Arizona. No difference in geography, climate, diseases. Institutions: different since one is in US and one is in Mexico.
- Spanish strategy of colonization: Capture the indigenous leader, claim the power, and coerce the indigenous people to give tribute and food.
- To gain a king's freedom, that king had to fill rooms or houses with gold.
- Virginia: no gold and precious metals, unlike Mexico and Peru. It was the colonists who did the work, not the indigenous people.
- It was impossible to force settlers into a rigid, hierarchical society, because there were too many options open to them in the New World. They had to be provided with incentives for them to want to work.
- US Constitution: Not all people could vote in the first elections. Slavery was constitutional.
- Even with the Civil War, there was still stability in the US. Mexico, not so.
- Lack of competition in Mexican banks, which means that only wealthy people were able to get those loans. Bankers had different rules, because politicians had different rules.
- Compare Bill Gates and Carlos Slim: Microsoft was sued for a monopoly, and Slim's group was able to buy the telecommunications monopoly in Mexico. There is a `recurso de amparo` in Mexico, literally an "appeal for protection". This is a petition to argue that a particular law does not apply to you. Slim tried it out in the US, but it didn't work, as he tried to set up a company without competition.
- Tech figures have incentives. Economic institutions in the US make it easy for people to start companies. While economic institutions are critical for determining whether a country is poor or rich, it is politics and political institutions that determine what economic institutions a country has.
- Once society gets organized in a certain way, this tends to persist. This is why it's so hard to make poor countries prosperous.

# Theories That Don't Work

- History illustrates that their is no connection between climate or geography and economic success. Before the Europeans arrived, the rich countries in America were the ones near the equator. Same with China/India over Europe in pre-modern times. Same with South Africa vs other parts of Africa. Places like Angkor, Ethiopia, Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan.
- Tropical diseases cause suffering, but England was also unhealthy in the 19th century. Eventually, it invested in an effective health service.
- Variation within continents/inequality: why?
- Poor countries are poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty. They get it wrong not by mistake or ignorance, but on purpose.
