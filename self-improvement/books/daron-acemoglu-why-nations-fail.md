# Why Nations Fail

# Preface

- Egypt: Economic problems are caused by lack of political rights. An ineffective/corrupt state and a society where they cannot use their talent, ambition, ingenuity, and education. Political power exercises/monopolized by a narrow elite.
- Agriculture, culture (work ethic/cultural traits/religion), rulers.
- Countries such as the UK and US became rich because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power and created a society where political rights were more broadly distributed/government was accountable to citizens.

# So Close and Yet So Different

- Nogales, Sonora vs Nogales, Arizona. No difference in geography, climate, diseases. Institutions: different since one is in US and one is in Mexico.
- Spanish strategy of colonization: Capture the indigenous leader, claim the power, and coerce the indigenous people to give tribute and food.
- To gain a king's freedom, that king had to fill rooms or houses with gold.
- Virginia: no gold and precious metals, unlike Mexico and Peru. It was the colonists who did the work, not the indigenous people.
- It was impossible to force settlers into a rigid, hierarchical society, because there were too many options open to them in the New World. They had to be provided with incentives for them to want to work.
- US Constitution: Not all people could vote in the first elections. Slavery was constitutional.
- Even with the Civil War, there was still stability in the US. Mexico, not so.
- Lack of competition in Mexican banks, which means that only wealthy people were able to get those loans. Bankers had different rules, because politicians had different rules.
- Compare Bill Gates and Carlos Slim: Microsoft was sued for a monopoly, and Slim's group was able to buy the telecommunications monopoly in Mexico. There is a `recurso de amparo` in Mexico, literally an "appeal for protection". This is a petition to argue that a particular law does not apply to you. Slim tried it out in the US, but it didn't work, as he tried to set up a company without competition.
- Tech figures have incentives. Economic institutions in the US make it easy for people to start companies. While economic institutions are critical for determining whether a country is poor or rich, it is politics and political institutions that determine what economic institutions a country has.
- Once society gets organized in a certain way, this tends to persist. This is why it's so hard to make poor countries prosperous.

# Theories That Don't Work

- History illustrates that their is no connection between climate or geography and economic success. Before the Europeans arrived, the rich countries in America were the ones near the equator. Same with China/India over Europe in pre-modern times. Same with South Africa vs other parts of Africa. Places like Angkor, Ethiopia, Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan.
- Tropical diseases cause suffering, but England was also unhealthy in the 19th century. Eventually, it invested in an effective health service.
- Variation within continents/inequality: why?
- Poor countries are poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty. They get it wrong not by mistake or ignorance, but on purpose.

# The Making of Prosperity and Poverty

- N Korea: Lack of private property mean that few people had incentives to invest or to exert effort to increase or even maintain productivity.
- Teenagers in N Korea: poverty, no entrepreneurial initiative, creativity, education to prepare them for skilled work. They will not be able to own property, start a business, or become prosperous.
- S Korea, the state supports economic activity. Inclusive economic institutions are those that allow and encourage participation by the great mass of people in economic activities. To be inclusive, economic institutions must feature secure private property, an unbiased system of law, and a provision of public services that provides a level playing field in which people can exchange and contract; it also must permit the entry of new businesses and allow people to choose their careers.
- Secure private property rights are central, since only those with such rights will be willing to invest and increase productivity.
- ***A businessman who expects his output to be stolen, expropriated, or taxed away will have little incentive to work, let alone any incentive to undertake investments and innovations.***
- Secure property rights, the law, public services, and the freedom to contract/exchange all rely on the state, the institution with the capacity to impose order, prevent theft and fraud, and enforce contracts between private parties.
- You need roads/transport network, public infrastructure, regulation to prevent fraud. This is done by the state.
- All economic institutions are created by society. Politics is the process by which a society chooses the rules that will govern it.
- Industrializing Europe: elites in Europe saw the emergence of new businessmen and merchants as eroding their trading privileges. With the spread of the IR, they were the biggest economic and political losers. Russia/Austria-Hungary's monarchs blocked industrialization, and so their economy stagnated.
- Artisans with good manual skills opposed the spread of industry, but they didn't have political power, so they were muted.
- ***Powerful groups often stand against economic progress and against the engines of prosperity. Growth move forward only if they are not blocked by the economic losers who anticipate that their economic privileges will be lost, and by the political losers who fear that their political power will be eroded.***
- 16th Century Congo: Extractive economic institutions that blocked all the engines of prosperity.
- Extractive political institutions and growth: possible when the elites can directly allocate resources to high-productivity activities that they themselves control (ex: slavery and plantations, people were poor, but sugar was expensive).

# Small Difference and Critical Junctures: The Weight of History

- Black Plague: actually affected Europe's feudal society. The king owned the land and he granted it to the lords in exchange for military services, and the lords allocated land to the peasants, and the peasants did labor.
- So they tried to make wages lower, and they made a law that is anti-enticement where peasants cannot leave unless the employer gives permission to. A revolt broke out, and wages rose.

# Growth Under Extractive Institutions

- Lele vs Bushong (Congo). Lele tribe is poor, Bushong tribe is rich. Bushong king in the 1620 organized society: bureaucracy for taxes, legal system, police force, trial by jury. Then there was a political revolution and agriculture was reorganized, lower age of marriage so men could be in the labor force earlier.
- Contrast to the west (Lele) where there is an absence of law and order.
- Farming over hunter gathering: moving is costly, and it's impossible to store food on the move. Processing tools are useful, buy heavy to carry. Maize stores so well, so they were cultivated in the Americas.
- Disadvantage: villages need more effective ways of resolving concept and a better notion of property. Rules had to be developed and institutions had to be made and rules had to be enforced.
- Economic development: create an extractive institution with some degree of state centralization.
- Extractive institutions: they can generate limited prosperity, while at the same time distributing it into the hands of a small elite. For this to happen, there has to be some political centralization.
- This growth is not sustainable, as its incentives cannot stimulate technological progress (no incentives).

# Why Nations Fail Today

- The most common reason why nations fail today is because they have extractive institutions. Zimbabwe illustrates the economic and social consequences.
- Zimbabwe inherited a set of highly extractive political and economic institutions in 1980. Ian Smith/the whites were doing the extracting before Mugabe went into power.
- ***NATIONS FAIL TODAY because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate. Extractive political institutions support these economic institutions by cementing the power of those who benefit from the extraction. Extractive economic and political institutions, though their details vary under different circumstances, are always at the root of this failure. ‚Äù***

# Breaking the Mold

- Botswana: Democratic, holds regular and competitive elections, has never experienced civil war or military interventions. Elites are in favor of well-enforced property rights.

# Understanding Prosperity and Poverty

- Inclusive economic institutions: enforce property rights, create a level playing field, and encourage investments in new technologies and skills. They are more conducive to economic growth than extractive economic institutions that are structured to extract resources from the many by the few and that fail to protect property rights or provide incentives for economic activity.
- Extractive institutions that have some degree of political centralization are able to generate some amount of growth, but this is not sustainable.
  - Sustained economic growth requires innovation, and innovation cannot be decoupled from creative destruction, which replaces the old with the new in the economic realm.
  - *The ability of those who dominate extractive institutions implies that political power is highly coveted, making many groups and individuals fight to obtain it.*
- Major institutional change: when major events such as the Black Death, the opening of Atlantic trade routes, and the Industrial Revolutions happen, they offer the potential for rapid but also disruptive changes in economies.
- Ex: Peru is not condemned to poverty, as it was very rich when it was the Incan empire.
- IMF itself recognizes that poor development is caused by bad economic policies and institutions.
- History is littered with examples of reform movements that succumbed to the iron law of oligarchy and replaced one set of extractive institutions with even more pernicious ones.
