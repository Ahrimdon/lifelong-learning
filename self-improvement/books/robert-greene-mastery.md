# Introduction

- Mastery: the feeling that we have a greater command of reality, other people, and ourselves. For some people, it becomes their way of seeing the world.
- As we continue to observe and see the lead of others, we gain clarity, and if we keep practicing, we gain fluency, and we begin to see connections that were invisible to us before. We gain confidence in our ability to solve problems or overcome weaknesses through sheer persistence.
- Apprenticeship, creative-active, and mastery. Mastery: our focus is so deep that we can now see the whole picture with complete clarity: we have access to the heart of life, and this is why the artwork of masters touches us to the core, because they have captured something of the essence of reality.
- Animals: instincts. Humans: thinking and rationality to understand its environment.
  - So much of our obsessive, internal thought process tends to disconnect us from the world.
  - Think of mastery this way: throughout history, men and women have felt trapped by the limitations of their consciousness, by their lack of contact with reality and the power to affect the world around them.
- People have called "mastery" genius. They see it as the product of privilege or inborn talent.

## Evolution of mastery:

- Front-facing eyes, so we can see in 3-D an perspective. These are used to navigate branches, fruits, berries.
- Upright stance: they can see farther into the distance, and they can identify important details in their environment.
- Our ancestors' survival depended on the intensity of their attention. The longer and harder they looked, the more they can distinguish between an opportunity and a danger.
- Early humans have the ability to detach and think as their primary advantage in the struggle to avoid predators and find food. It connected them to a reality other animals could not access.
- Over the years, social intelligence became increasingly sophisticated, allowing these ancestors to compete with one another on a high level.
- At some point, our visual and social skills were able to develop the skill of hunting. Then, we became creative (art), then seasonal hunters, and our brains grew larger.
- Mirror neurons: our neurons for specific commands fire not only when we execute specific actions but also when we see other people doing those same actions.
- For humans, we can even place ourselves inside another person's mind and imagine what they might be thinking.
- Mastery â†’ automatic thinking, then being able to visualize not on the actions involved, but something more. The longer our ancestors observed something, the deeper their understanding and connection to reality became. With experience, they get better at hunting, with practice, their ability to make tools would improve. The body can decay, but the mind can continue to learn and adapt.
- We can say that this revolutionary relationship to time fundamentally altered the human mind itself and gave it a particular quality or grain.
- **It is the height of stupidity to believe that in the course of your short life, your few decades of consciousness, you can somehow rewire the configurations of your brain through technology and wishful thinking, overcoming the effect of six million years of development.**

## Keys to Mastery

- Darwin: as a child, his passion was collecting biological specimens. Father wanted him to do something related to the church, but he took the job in the HMS Beagle as its biologist. When he returned to England, he devoted the rest of his life to the task of explaining his theory of evolution. He had to deal with drudgery, develop political and social skills to handle all the prejudice against such a theory in England.
- Elements repeated in masters:
  - Youthful passion or predilection
  - Chance encounter that allows them to discover how to apply it
  - Apprenticeship where they come alive with energy and focus
  - Have an intensity in their desire to learn
  - Deep, possibly genetic/inborn inclination toward a particular subject
- It's usually emotional qualities (desire, patience, persistence, and confidence) that end up playing a much larger role in success that sheer reasoning powers.
- In the past, very few people can become masters. Only elites or those with a superhuman amount of energy and drive could pursue a career of their choice and master it.
- There is this narrative that determines much of what we do, we are just products of our times, the individual is just a myth, and human behavior can be reduced to statistical trends.
- See your attempt at attaining mastery as something necessary and positive. The world is teeming with problems, many of them of our own creation. To solve them will require a tremendous amount of effort and creativity. Relying on genetics, tech, magic, or being nice alone will not save us. We require the energy not only to address practical matters, but also to forge new institutions and orders that fit our changed circumstances.
- Try to convince yourself of this: people get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions in life. The brain is really super plastic. And people who are passive create a mental landscape that is barren. Because of their limited experiences and action, all kinds of connections in the brain die off from lack of use.
