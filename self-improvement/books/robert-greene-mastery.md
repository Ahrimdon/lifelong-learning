# Introduction

- Mastery: the feeling that we have a greater command of reality, other people, and ourselves. For some people, it becomes their way of seeing the world.
- As we continue to observe and see the lead of others, we gain clarity, and if we keep practicing, we gain fluency, and we begin to see connections that were invisible to us before. We gain confidence in our ability to solve problems or overcome weaknesses through sheer persistence.
- Apprenticeship, creative-active, and mastery. Mastery: our focus is so deep that we can now see the whole picture with complete clarity: we have access to the heart of life, and this is why the artwork of masters touches us to the core, because they have captured something of the essence of reality.
- Animals: instincts. Humans: thinking and rationality to understand its environment.
  - So much of our obsessive, internal thought process tends to disconnect us from the world.
  - Think of mastery this way: throughout history, men and women have felt trapped by the limitations of their consciousness, by their lack of contact with reality and the power to affect the world around them.
- People have called "mastery" genius. They see it as the product of privilege or inborn talent.

## Evolution of mastery:

- Front-facing eyes, so we can see in 3-D an perspective. These are used to navigate branches, fruits, berries.
- Upright stance: they can see farther into the distance, and they can identify important details in their environment.
- Our ancestors' survival depended on the intensity of their attention. The longer and harder they looked, the more they can distinguish between an opportunity and a danger.
- Early humans have the ability to detach and think as their primary advantage in the struggle to avoid predators and find food. It connected them to a reality other animals could not access.
- Over the years, social intelligence became increasingly sophisticated, allowing these ancestors to compete with one another on a high level.
- At some point, our visual and social skills were able to develop the skill of hunting. Then, we became creative (art), then seasonal hunters, and our brains grew larger.
- Mirror neurons: our neurons for specific commands fire not only when we execute specific actions but also when we see other people doing those same actions.
- For humans, we can even place ourselves inside another person's mind and imagine what they might be thinking.
- Mastery â†’ automatic thinking, then being able to visualize not on the actions involved, but something more. The longer our ancestors observed something, the deeper their understanding and connection to reality became. With experience, they get better at hunting, with practice, their ability to make tools would improve. The body can decay, but the mind can continue to learn and adapt.
- We can say that this revolutionary relationship to time fundamentally altered the human mind itself and gave it a particular quality or grain.
- **It is the height of stupidity to believe that in the course of your short life, your few decades of consciousness, you can somehow rewire the configurations of your brain through technology and wishful thinking, overcoming the effect of six million years of development.**

## Keys to Mastery

- Darwin: as a child, his passion was collecting biological specimens. Father wanted him to do something related to the church, but he took the job in the HMS Beagle as its biologist. When he returned to England, he devoted the rest of his life to the task of explaining his theory of evolution. He had to deal with drudgery, develop political and social skills to handle all the prejudice against such a theory in England.
- Elements repeated in masters:
  - Youthful passion or predilection
  - Chance encounter that allows them to discover how to apply it
  - Apprenticeship where they come alive with energy and focus
  - Have an intensity in their desire to learn
  - Deep, possibly genetic/inborn inclination toward a particular subject
- It's usually emotional qualities (desire, patience, persistence, and confidence) that end up playing a much larger role in success that sheer reasoning powers.
- In the past, very few people can become masters. Only elites or those with a superhuman amount of energy and drive could pursue a career of their choice and master it.
- There is this narrative that determines much of what we do, we are just products of our times, the individual is just a myth, and human behavior can be reduced to statistical trends.
- See your attempt at attaining mastery as something necessary and positive. The world is teeming with problems, many of them of our own creation. To solve them will require a tremendous amount of effort and creativity. Relying on genetics, tech, magic, or being nice alone will not save us. We require the energy not only to address practical matters, but also to forge new institutions and orders that fit our changed circumstances.
- Try to convince yourself of this: people get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions in life. The brain is really super plastic. And people who are passive create a mental landscape that is barren. Because of their limited experiences and action, all kinds of connections in the brain die off from lack of use.

# Discover Your Calling: The Life's Task

- da Vinci: Barred from attending the university/practicing the noble professions.
- Began sketching a bunch of things in the woods. Started off as an apprentice in the studio of Florentine artist Andrea del Verrocchio.
- Moved from Florence to Milan and he devised a new strategy: he would be more than an artist, and would try to pursue all of the crafts and sciences that interested him: architecture, military engineering, hydraulics, anatomy, sculpture. He can be an adviser and artist, for a nice stipend. His mind worked best when he had different projects at hand, allowing him to build all kinds of connections between them.
- He didn't really care about the finished product; it was the search and process in creating something that had always excited him.
- Being born illegitimate: allowed him to develop in is own way. Paper in his house (it was rare at the time) allowed him to be an artist.
- Keys to mastery:
  - There was some kind of force or voice or sense of destiny that has guided them forward. Some inner voice.
  - Everyone is unique and has some sort of life task that is apt for them.
  - There is a counterforce that is also very powerful. You want to fit in, you think what you do is embarrassing, your parents suck, you want a lucrative career path. If these counterforces become strong enough, you can lose complete contact with your uniqueness, with who you really are. Your inclinations and desires become modeled on those of others.
  - Try to avoid making decisions based on what other people are thinking for you.
- Realizing your Life's Task:
  - Connect or reconnect with your inclinations, the sense of uniqueness.
  - Look at the career path you are on or are about to begin. Enlarge the concept of work: too often, we make a separation of work and life outside work. **Work is often seen as a means of making money so we can enjoy that second life that we lead.** This is a depressing attitude because we spend so much of our waking life at work. If we experience this time as something to get through on the way to real pleasure, then our hours at work represent a tragic waste of the short time we have to live.
- Try to make your work be seen as something more inspiring: make it be like part of your vocation.
- **What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives.** In the past, it was organized religion, but most of us now live in a secularized world. We are unique, we must build our own world.
- **Feeling that we are called to accomplish something is the most positive way for us to supply this sense of purpose and direction. It is a religious-like quest for each of us. This quest should not be seen as selfish or antisocial. It is in fact connected to something much larger than our individual lives.**
- Become who you are by learning who you are. You are born with a particular makeup and tendencies that mark you as a piece of fate. It is who you are to the core. Some people never become who they are; they stop trusting in themselves; they conform to the tastes of others, and they end up wearing a mask that hides their true nature.

## Strategies for Finding Your Life's Task

- Return to your origins: the primal inclination strategy.
- In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it.
- Inclination to a subject: you know it because they aren't infected by the desires of  other people.
- Niche: Being an anomaly in terms of the things you are interested in. Figure out a niche that is not crowded with competitors.
- You are not tied to a particular position; your loyalty is not to a career or a company. You are committed to your life's task, to give it full expression. It's up to you to find it and guide it accordingly. You are on your own.
- No patience for the usual forms of education.

# Submit to Reality: The Ideal Apprenticeship

- As the journey progressed, Darwin noticed that he can labor at all hours of the day, and he waited wasting a single minute of the voyage.
- In the stories of the greatest masters, we can inevitably detect a phase in their lives in which all of their future powers were in development.
- The apprenticeship must be conducted by each individual in his or her own way.
- **Choose places of work that offer the greatest possibilities for learning. Move toward challenges that will toughen and improve you, where you will get the most objective feedback on your performance and progress. Do not choose apprenticeships that seem easy and comfortable.**
- Whenever you must learn a new skill or alter your career path, reconnect with that youthful, adventurous part of yourself.

## Apprenticeship Phases

- Passive: studying and observing the reality as deeply as possible. The greatest mistake you can make: imagining you have to get attention, impress people, and prove yourself. Acknowledge the reality and submit to it, muting your colors and keeping in the background as much as possible.
  - Every task you are given offers opportunities to observe this world at work. Fit in so you can avoid needless battles that could disrupt your scientific work. Darwin trained to see himself about how things are.
- Because there were few books or drawings at the time, apprentices would learn the trade by watching Masters and imitating them as closely as possible. That's the 10K hours thing.
- Our brains are highly suited for learning via mirror neurons.
- It remains the case that we learn best through practice and repetition. The more we practice, the more fluent we become, and we enter a cycle of accelerated returns in which the practice becomes easier and more interesting, leading to the ability to practice for longer hours, which increases your skill level, which in turn makes practice even more interesting.
- Begin with one skill that you can master, and that serves as a foundation for acquiring others. Avoid at all cost the idea that you can manage learning several skills at a time.
- The process of hardwiring cannot occur if you are constantly distracted, moving from one task to another.
- 7-10 years of sustained, solid practice = roughly the period of a traditional apprenticeship.

## The Ideal Apprenticeship

- Value learning over money. Your thoughts will tend to revolve around what you value most. If it's money, you will choose a place for your apprenticeship that offers the biggest paycheck. **Eventually, the time that was not spent on learning skills will catch up with you, and the fall will be painful.**
- Value learning above everything else. Never disdain an apprenticeship with no pay, because it is the height of wisdom to find the perfect mentor and offer your services as an assistant for free.
- Reading books and materials that go beyond what is required is always a good starting point. Being exposed to ideas in the wide world, you will tend to develop a hunger for more and more knowledge; you will find it harder to remain satisfied in any narrow corner.
- Feeling of inferiority: What prevents people from learning is not the subject itself, but certain learning disabilities: the sense of smugness/superiority, rigid ideas about what is real or true. If we feel like we know something,
- Unlike other animals, we humans retain what is known as neoteny: mental and physical traits of immaturity well into our adult years.
- When you enter a new environment, your task is to learn and absorb as much as possible. Try to revert to a childlike feeling of inferiority, the feeling that others know much more than you and that you are dependent upon them to learn.
- Placing yourself in circumstances that can make you feel uncertain help in becoming familiar with the situation and not being afraid. What was necessary was to trust the process and the results that would come from more practice.
- **What separates Masters from others: whenever we learn a skill, we frequently reach a point of frustration: what we are learning seems beyond our capabilities. Giving in to these feelings, we unconsciously quit on ourselves before we actually give up.**
-  ***Most of those who succeed in life have had the experience in their youth of having mastered some skill: a sport or game, a musical instrument, a foreign language, and so on. Buried in their minds is the sensation of overcoming their frustrations and entering the cycle of accelerated returns. In moments of doubt in the present, the memory of the past experience rises to the surface. Filled with trust in the process, they trudge on well past the point at which others slow down or mentally quit.***
- When it comes to mastering a skill, time is the magic ingredient. Assuming your practice proceeds at a steady level, over days and weeks, certain elements of the skill become hardwired.
  - The only real impediment is yourself and your emotions: your boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. You cannot suppress such emotions, and they are experienced by everyone, including Masters. Just have faith in the process.
- Move toward resistance and pain:
  - Practicing basketball, Bill Bradley set up chairs on the court to act as opponents. He would dribble around them, back and forth, for hours, until he could glide past them, quickly changing direction.
  - Developing peripheral vision: while walking, he would try to notice things on the other side of his eyes.
- To attain mastery, adopt what we call the Resistance Practice. Go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice.
  - Resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others.
  - Recognize your weaknesses and the elements you suck at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice.
  - Resist the lure of easing up on your focus. Train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two.
- Apprentice yourself in failure:
  - Henry Ford: a mechanical mind, but he needed an additional apprenticeship in becoming a businessman and entrepreneur. Fortunately, working on machines had developed in him a kind of practical intelligence, patience, and way of solving problems that could be applied to anything.
  - When a machine malfunctions, you do not take it personally, because it shows you inherent flaws and means of improvement. You just keep tinkering until you get it right.
  - **There are two kinds of failure: never trying out your ideas, because you're afraid or waiting for the perfect time, or having a bold spirit, failing, and just trying again.**
- Combining the "how" and the "what": we must make ourselves study as deeply as possible the technology we use, the functioning of the group we work in, the economics of our field, its lifeblood. Constantly ask questions: how do things work, how do decisions get made, how does the group interact? Rounding our knowledge in this way will give us a deeper feel for reality and the heightened power to alter it.
