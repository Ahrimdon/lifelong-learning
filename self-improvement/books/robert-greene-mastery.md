# Introduction

- Mastery: the feeling that we have a greater command of reality, other people, and ourselves. For some people, it becomes their way of seeing the world.
- As we continue to observe and see the lead of others, we gain clarity, and if we keep practicing, we gain fluency, and we begin to see connections that were invisible to us before. We gain confidence in our ability to solve problems or overcome weaknesses through sheer persistence.
- Apprenticeship, creative-active, and mastery. Mastery: our focus is so deep that we can now see the whole picture with complete clarity: we have access to the heart of life, and this is why the artwork of masters touches us to the core, because they have captured something of the essence of reality.
- Animals: instincts. Humans: thinking and rationality to understand its environment.
  - So much of our obsessive, internal thought process tends to disconnect us from the world.
  - Think of mastery this way: throughout history, men and women have felt trapped by the limitations of their consciousness, by their lack of contact with reality and the power to affect the world around them.
- People have called "mastery" genius. They see it as the product of privilege or inborn talent.

## Evolution of mastery:

- Front-facing eyes, so we can see in 3-D an perspective. These are used to navigate branches, fruits, berries.
- Upright stance: they can see farther into the distance, and they can identify important details in their environment.
- Our ancestors' survival depended on the intensity of their attention. The longer and harder they looked, the more they can distinguish between an opportunity and a danger.
- Early humans have the ability to detach and think as their primary advantage in the struggle to avoid predators and find food. It connected them to a reality other animals could not access.
- Over the years, social intelligence became increasingly sophisticated, allowing these ancestors to compete with one another on a high level.
- At some point, our visual and social skills were able to develop the skill of hunting. Then, we became creative (art), then seasonal hunters, and our brains grew larger.
- Mirror neurons: our neurons for specific commands fire not only when we execute specific actions but also when we see other people doing those same actions.
- For humans, we can even place ourselves inside another person's mind and imagine what they might be thinking.
- Mastery â†’ automatic thinking, then being able to visualize not on the actions involved, but something more. The longer our ancestors observed something, the deeper their understanding and connection to reality became. With experience, they get better at hunting, with practice, their ability to make tools would improve. The body can decay, but the mind can continue to learn and adapt.
- We can say that this revolutionary relationship to time fundamentally altered the human mind itself and gave it a particular quality or grain.
- **It is the height of stupidity to believe that in the course of your short life, your few decades of consciousness, you can somehow rewire the configurations of your brain through technology and wishful thinking, overcoming the effect of six million years of development.**

## Keys to Mastery

- Darwin: as a child, his passion was collecting biological specimens. Father wanted him to do something related to the church, but he took the job in the HMS Beagle as its biologist. When he returned to England, he devoted the rest of his life to the task of explaining his theory of evolution. He had to deal with drudgery, develop political and social skills to handle all the prejudice against such a theory in England.
- Elements repeated in masters:
  - Youthful passion or predilection
  - Chance encounter that allows them to discover how to apply it
  - Apprenticeship where they come alive with energy and focus
  - Have an intensity in their desire to learn
  - Deep, possibly genetic/inborn inclination toward a particular subject
- It's usually emotional qualities (desire, patience, persistence, and confidence) that end up playing a much larger role in success that sheer reasoning powers.
- In the past, very few people can become masters. Only elites or those with a superhuman amount of energy and drive could pursue a career of their choice and master it.
- There is this narrative that determines much of what we do, we are just products of our times, the individual is just a myth, and human behavior can be reduced to statistical trends.
- See your attempt at attaining mastery as something necessary and positive. The world is teeming with problems, many of them of our own creation. To solve them will require a tremendous amount of effort and creativity. Relying on genetics, tech, magic, or being nice alone will not save us. We require the energy not only to address practical matters, but also to forge new institutions and orders that fit our changed circumstances.
- Try to convince yourself of this: people get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions in life. The brain is really super plastic. And people who are passive create a mental landscape that is barren. Because of their limited experiences and action, all kinds of connections in the brain die off from lack of use.

# Discover Your Calling: The Life's Task

- da Vinci: Barred from attending the university/practicing the noble professions.
- Began sketching a bunch of things in the woods. Started off as an apprentice in the studio of Florentine artist Andrea del Verrocchio.
- Moved from Florence to Milan and he devised a new strategy: he would be more than an artist, and would try to pursue all of the crafts and sciences that interested him: architecture, military engineering, hydraulics, anatomy, sculpture. He can be an adviser and artist, for a nice stipend. His mind worked best when he had different projects at hand, allowing him to build all kinds of connections between them.
- He didn't really care about the finished product; it was the search and process in creating something that had always excited him.
- Being born illegitimate: allowed him to develop in is own way. Paper in his house (it was rare at the time) allowed him to be an artist.
- Keys to mastery:
  - There was some kind of force or voice or sense of destiny that has guided them forward. Some inner voice.
  - Everyone is unique and has some sort of life task that is apt for them.
  - There is a counterforce that is also very powerful. You want to fit in, you think what you do is embarrassing, your parents suck, you want a lucrative career path. If these counterforces become strong enough, you can lose complete contact with your uniqueness, with who you really are. Your inclinations and desires become modeled on those of others.
  - Try to avoid making decisions based on what other people are thinking for you.
- Realizing your Life's Task:
  - Connect or reconnect with your inclinations, the sense of uniqueness.
  - Look at the career path you are on or are about to begin. Enlarge the concept of work: too often, we make a separation of work and life outside work. **Work is often seen as a means of making money so we can enjoy that second life that we lead.** This is a depressing attitude because we spend so much of our waking life at work. If we experience this time as something to get through on the way to real pleasure, then our hours at work represent a tragic waste of the short time we have to live.
- Try to make your work be seen as something more inspiring: make it be like part of your vocation.
- **What we lack most in the modern world is a sense of a larger purpose to our lives.** In the past, it was organized religion, but most of us now live in a secularized world. We are unique, we must build our own world.
- **Feeling that we are called to accomplish something is the most positive way for us to supply this sense of purpose and direction. It is a religious-like quest for each of us. This quest should not be seen as selfish or antisocial. It is in fact connected to something much larger than our individual lives.**
- Become who you are by learning who you are. You are born with a particular makeup and tendencies that mark you as a piece of fate. It is who you are to the core. Some people never become who they are; they stop trusting in themselves; they conform to the tastes of others, and they end up wearing a mask that hides their true nature.

## Strategies for Finding Your Life's Task

- Return to your origins: the primal inclination strategy.
- In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it.
- Inclination to a subject: you know it because they aren't infected by the desires of  other people.
- Niche: Being an anomaly in terms of the things you are interested in. Figure out a niche that is not crowded with competitors.
- You are not tied to a particular position; your loyalty is not to a career or a company. You are committed to your life's task, to give it full expression. It's up to you to find it and guide it accordingly. You are on your own.
- No patience for the usual forms of education.

# Submit to Reality: The Ideal Apprenticeship

- As the journey progressed, Darwin noticed that he can labor at all hours of the day, and he waited wasting a single minute of the voyage.
- In the stories of the greatest masters, we can inevitably detect a phase in their lives in which all of their future powers were in development.
- The apprenticeship must be conducted by each individual in his or her own way.
- **Choose places of work that offer the greatest possibilities for learning. Move toward challenges that will toughen and improve you, where you will get the most objective feedback on your performance and progress. Do not choose apprenticeships that seem easy and comfortable.**
- Whenever you must learn a new skill or alter your career path, reconnect with that youthful, adventurous part of yourself.

## Apprenticeship Phases

- Passive: studying and observing the reality as deeply as possible. The greatest mistake you can make: imagining you have to get attention, impress people, and prove yourself. Acknowledge the reality and submit to it, muting your colors and keeping in the background as much as possible.
  - Every task you are given offers opportunities to observe this world at work. Fit in so you can avoid needless battles that could disrupt your scientific work. Darwin trained to see himself about how things are.
- Because there were few books or drawings at the time, apprentices would learn the trade by watching Masters and imitating them as closely as possible. That's the 10K hours thing.
- Our brains are highly suited for learning via mirror neurons.
- It remains the case that we learn best through practice and repetition. The more we practice, the more fluent we become, and we enter a cycle of accelerated returns in which the practice becomes easier and more interesting, leading to the ability to practice for longer hours, which increases your skill level, which in turn makes practice even more interesting.
- Begin with one skill that you can master, and that serves as a foundation for acquiring others. Avoid at all cost the idea that you can manage learning several skills at a time.
- The process of hardwiring cannot occur if you are constantly distracted, moving from one task to another.
- 7-10 years of sustained, solid practice = roughly the period of a traditional apprenticeship.

## The Ideal Apprenticeship

- Value learning over money. Your thoughts will tend to revolve around what you value most. If it's money, you will choose a place for your apprenticeship that offers the biggest paycheck. **Eventually, the time that was not spent on learning skills will catch up with you, and the fall will be painful.**
- Value learning above everything else. Never disdain an apprenticeship with no pay, because it is the height of wisdom to find the perfect mentor and offer your services as an assistant for free.
- Reading books and materials that go beyond what is required is always a good starting point. Being exposed to ideas in the wide world, you will tend to develop a hunger for more and more knowledge; you will find it harder to remain satisfied in any narrow corner.
- Feeling of inferiority: What prevents people from learning is not the subject itself, but certain learning disabilities: the sense of smugness/superiority, rigid ideas about what is real or true. If we feel like we know something,
- Unlike other animals, we humans retain what is known as neoteny: mental and physical traits of immaturity well into our adult years.
- When you enter a new environment, your task is to learn and absorb as much as possible. Try to revert to a childlike feeling of inferiority, the feeling that others know much more than you and that you are dependent upon them to learn.
- Placing yourself in circumstances that can make you feel uncertain help in becoming familiar with the situation and not being afraid. What was necessary was to trust the process and the results that would come from more practice.
- **What separates Masters from others: whenever we learn a skill, we frequently reach a point of frustration: what we are learning seems beyond our capabilities. Giving in to these feelings, we unconsciously quit on ourselves before we actually give up.**
-  ***Most of those who succeed in life have had the experience in their youth of having mastered some skill: a sport or game, a musical instrument, a foreign language, and so on. Buried in their minds is the sensation of overcoming their frustrations and entering the cycle of accelerated returns. In moments of doubt in the present, the memory of the past experience rises to the surface. Filled with trust in the process, they trudge on well past the point at which others slow down or mentally quit.***
- When it comes to mastering a skill, time is the magic ingredient. Assuming your practice proceeds at a steady level, over days and weeks, certain elements of the skill become hardwired.
  - The only real impediment is yourself and your emotions: your boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. You cannot suppress such emotions, and they are experienced by everyone, including Masters. Just have faith in the process.
- Move toward resistance and pain:
  - Practicing basketball, Bill Bradley set up chairs on the court to act as opponents. He would dribble around them, back and forth, for hours, until he could glide past them, quickly changing direction.
  - Developing peripheral vision: while walking, he would try to notice things on the other side of his eyes.
- To attain mastery, adopt what we call the Resistance Practice. Go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice.
  - Resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others.
  - Recognize your weaknesses and the elements you suck at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice.
  - Resist the lure of easing up on your focus. Train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two.
- Apprentice yourself in failure:
  - Henry Ford: a mechanical mind, but he needed an additional apprenticeship in becoming a businessman and entrepreneur. Fortunately, working on machines had developed in him a kind of practical intelligence, patience, and way of solving problems that could be applied to anything.
  - When a machine malfunctions, you do not take it personally, because it shows you inherent flaws and means of improvement. You just keep tinkering until you get it right.
  - **There are two kinds of failure: never trying out your ideas, because you're afraid or waiting for the perfect time, or having a bold spirit, failing, and just trying again.**
- Combining the "how" and the "what": we must make ourselves study as deeply as possible the technology we use, the functioning of the group we work in, the economics of our field, its lifeblood. Constantly ask questions: how do things work, how do decisions get made, how does the group interact? Rounding our knowledge in this way will give us a deeper feel for reality and the heightened power to alter it.
- Hacker: He could discover things on his own, without having to follow a rigid path set up by others. The better you get at programming, the more you can make it do. Paul Graham: Just studied what interested him the most.
- You want to learn as many skills as possible, following the direction that circumstances lead you to, but only if they are related to your deepest interests. **Like a hacker, you value the process of self-discovery and making things that are of the highest quality.** You see what kind of work suits you and what you want to avoid at all costs. You move by trial and error, and this is how you pass your twenties.
- You avoid the trap of following one set career path. You are not sure where this will all lead, but you are taking full advantage of the openness of information, all of the knowledge about the skills now at our disposal. You see what kind of work suits you and what you want to avoid at all cost. You're the programmer of this wide-ranging apprenticeship, within the loose constraints of your personal interests.
- At a certain point, when you're ready to settle on something, ideas and opportunities will inevitably present themselves to you. When that happens, all of the skills you have accumulated will prove invaluable.
- Einstein and Mozart: started thinking and practicing really, really young, like less than ten years old. There is no shortcut to bypass the Apprenticeship Phase. It's the nature of the human brain to require such lengthy exposure to a field, which allows for complex skills to become deeply embedded and frees the mind up for real creative activity. *The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited for any kind of mastery. There is no possible reversal to this process.*

# Absorb the Master's Power: The Mentor Dynamic

- The mentor-protege relationship is the most efficient and productive form of learning. The right mentors know where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and experience become yours. Choose the mentor who best fits your needs and connects to your Life's Task. Once you have internalized their knowledge, you must move on and never remain in their shadow. Your goal is always to surpass your mentors in mastery and brilliance.
- Faraday: Read "Improvement of the Mind", a self-help guide written by Reverend Isaac Watts, first published in 1741, which was a system for improving your lot in life, no matter your social class.
- Watts: learning had to be an active process. He recommended not just reading about scientific discoveries, but actually recreating the experiments that led to them. The importance of having teachers and not just learning from books.
- On mentors vs books: books are general, and are hit-and-miss. Mentors streamline the process.
- By nature, mentors feel emotionally invested in your education. This can be because they like you, or see in you a younger version of themselves, and can relive their own youth through you. When you admire people, you become more susceptible to absorbing and imitating everything they do.
- ***Masters are those who by nature have suffered to get to where they are. They have experienced endless criticisms of their work, doubts about their progress, setbacks along the way.*** As mentors, they can gauge the extent of our progress, the weaknesses in our character, the ordeals we must go through to advance. In this day and age, you must get the sharpest dose of reality that is possible from your mentor. You must go in search of it and welcome it. *If possible, choose a mentor who is known for supplying this form of tough love.*

# See People as They Are: Social Intelligence

- Benjamin Franklin: when it comes to work, he was rational and realistic, always looking to improve himself. When it comes to people, he can be swept up in his emotions and lose all contact with reality.
- In all of his future interactions with people, he would try to not get too emotional. He can then focus on the people he was dealing with, cutting off his own insecurities and desires from the equation.
- **It's like when you're writing a character and you're thinking inside the character you created. You can apply this in your life.**
- ***New philosophy: complete and radical acceptance of human nature. Some are frivolous, some are vindictive, and some are rigid. There are people like this everywhere, ever since the dawn of civilization. To get upset or try to alter them is futile, it will only make them bitter and resentful. Better to accept such people as one accepts the thorns on a rose.***
- Better to observe and accumulate knowledge on human nature, as one accumulates knowledge in the sciences.
- **Allow everyone the right to exist in accordance with the character he has, whatever it turns out to be: and all you should strive to do is to make use of this character in such a way as its kind of nature permits, rather than to hope for any alteration in it, or to condemn it offhand for what it is.** To become indignant at people's conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it rolls into your path. And with many people, the wisest thing you can do is to resolve to make use of those whom you cannot alter.

- Mirror neurons: humans could use those not only to imitate, but also to imagine what others might be thinking and feeling.
  - Compared to other animals, we humans enter the world weak and helpless. This period of immaturity gives us a chance to focus on developing our brain.
  - Social intelligence: focusing our attention outward instead of inward, moving past our tendency to idealize and demonize people, and seeing and accepting them as they are.
  - To be truly charming and socially effective, you have to understand people, and to understand them, you have to get outside yourself and immerse your mind in their world.
  - Instead of obsessing over himself and what other people were not giving him, he thought deeply of how they were experiencing the world, what they were feeling and missing. Emotions seen inside other people create empathy and bring a deep understanding of what makes them tick.
- Specific knowledge of human nature: the ability to read people, to get a feel for how they see the world, and to understand their individuality.
- General knowledge of human nature: understanding the overall patterns of human behavior that transcend us as individuals, including some of the darker qualities we often disregard.
- Experiencing an uncanny connection with another person:
  - In our normal state, we are often nervous, defensive, and self-absorbed, but in those moments of connection, the internal monologue is shut off, and we pick up more cues and signals from the other person than usual.
  - When our ancestors needed to cooperate, but didn't have the interior monologue that comes with words, they had a powerful sensitivity to the moods and feeling of others within the group, bordering on telepathy.
  - Pay less attention to the words that people say and greater attention to their tone of voice, the look in their eye, and their body language, all signals that might reveal a nervousness or excitement that is not expressed verbally.
  - Emotional people reveal a lot more. Pay deep attention and pick up cues from them that will register with you as feelings or sensations.
- After you have known people for a while, try to imagine that you are experiencing the world from their point of view, placing yourself in their circumstances and feeling what they feel.
  - Look for any common emotional experiences.
  - The goal is not to literally inhabit their mind, but to gain a more realistic appraisal of their worldview. Think of people's actions and decisions. What are the hidden motives behind those?
- Take note of people's actions and decisions, which often revolve around power. People dress up things with their words, but their actions say much more about their character, about what's going on underneath the surface.
- ***When looking for cues to observe, be sensitive to extreme behavior: People usually wear this like a mask to hide the opposite, to distract others from the truth.*** They are blustery because they are inwardly very insecure, and they are overly friendly because they are secretly ambitious and aggressive, or they joke to hide a mean-spiritedness.
  - Decode every possible sign: small things like clothes they wear, how organized they are of their workspace, choice of mate or partner, especially if it seems slightly inconsistent with the character they try to project.
  - Little things like chronically being late, insufficient attention to detail, not returning favors on your part are signs of something deeper about their character. These are patterns you must pay attention to.
  - People have personas in public that act like a second skin to protect them. Unless you are incredibly perceptive, you will tend to mistake the mask for the reality.
  - What you want is a picture of a person's character over time, which will give you a far more accurate sense of their true character than any first impression could. So restrain yourself from the natural tendency to judge right away, and let the passing months reveal more and more about who people are, as you get better at reading them.
  - In the end, your goal is to identify and pierce through to what makes people unique, to understand the character and values that lie at their cores.

## General Knowledge: The Seven Deadly Realities

- Throughout recorded history, we can detect patterns of human behavior that transcend culture and time, indicating certain universal features that belong to us as a species.
  - ***Ex of negative ones: envy, conformism, rigidity, self-obsessiveness, laziness, flightiness, passive-aggression. People do not like to display these traits publicly because they are seen as ugly and undesirable.***

- ***Envy:*** It's our nature to constantly compare ourselves to others, in terms of money, looks, coolness, intelligence, popularity, or any number of categories. We often find a way to minimize it because it's an unpleasant emotion: we say it's because of luck, connections, or that it won't last.
  - If you detect unusual levels of insecurity, he/she will certainly be more prone to envy.
  - IF you have a gift for a certain skill, you should make a point of occasionally displaying some weakness in another area, avoiding the great danger of appearing too perfect/too talented.
  - Dealing with insecure types: show interest, turn to them for advice.
  - Don't boast of any success, ascribe it to just good luck on your part.
  - Intelligence is the most sensitive trigger point for envy: try your best to maintain a non-threatening exterior and to blend in well with the group, at least until you are so successful that it no longer matters.

- ***Conformism:*** The reality of things is that those who are markedly different makes them feel uncomfortable and insecure, calling the values of the dominant culture into question.
  - You can become aware of this by observing how much people feel the need to display certain opinions or ideas that conform to the standards. There will always be a few within the group who are the overseers of correctness and who can be quite dangerous.
  - When it come to matters of politics, morals, and values, make a show of adhering to the accepted standards of your environment.

- ***Rigidity:*** Whenever we humans face a situation that seems complicated, our response is to resort to a kind of artificial simplicity, to create habits and routines that gives us a sense of control.
  - People do not advertise their rigidity, you'll just see it when you try something new. Some in the group will become irritable, even panicky at the thought of any kind of change.
  - The strategy is to accept rigidity in others, outwardly displaying deference to their need for order. On your own, work to maintain your open spirit, letting go of ad habits and deliberately cultivating new ideas.

- ***Self-obsessiveness:*** In the work environment, we almost think first and foremost of ourselves.
  - Because being self-interested does not make us feel or appear noble, many people go out of their way to disguise their self-interest.
  - When it come to asking for a favor or help, think first of appealing to people's self-interest in some way. Look at the world through their eyes, getting a sense of their needs.

- ***Laziness:***
  - If you are not careful and talk too much, they will steal your best ideas and make them their own, saving themselves all of the mental effort that went into conceiving them.
  - The best defense: prudence. Keep your ideas to yourself, or conceal enough of the details so that it is not possible to steal them.

- ***Passive aggression.***
  - There is a human fear of direct confrontation, and the emotions that a conflict can churn up/loss of control that ensues. Making attacks subtle enough so that it's hard to figure out what's going on, while giving them control of the dynamic.
  - Best defense: call out, ignore, but there are some people out there seething with insecurities who are veritable passive-aggressive warriors and can literally ruin your life.

## Strategies for Acquiring Social Intelligence

- ***Speak through your work.*** Social intelligence matters. Scientists must also play the courtier. He involved others in his work, making them emotionally attached to his theory.
  - Your work is the single greatest means at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence. By being efficient and detail-oriented in what you do, you demonstrate that you are thinking of the group at large and advancing its cause. If you are experiencing the pressures of political maneuvering within the group, do not lose your head and become consumed with all of the pettiness.
- ***Craft the appropriate persona.*** The personality we project to the world plays a substantial role in our success and in our ascension to mastery. The public arena finds weaknesses in character to exploit.
  - *People will judge you based on your outward appearance.* If you are not careful and simply assume that it is best to be yourself, they will begin to ascribe to you all kinds of qualities that have little to do with what you are, but correspond to what they want to see.
  - You can mold these appearances, create the image that suits you, and control people's judgments.
  - Never settle on one image or give people the power to completely figure you out. Be one step ahead of the public.
  - This is a key element in social intelligence, not something evil. We all wear masks in the social arena. By creating a persona that is mysterious, intriguing, and masterful, you are playing to the public, giving them something compelling and pleasurable to witness.
- ***See yourself as others see you.***
  - You can make yourself so efficient in whatever job you have that your social handicap would not matter.
  - Do not make your coworkers feel insecure, useless, and inferior. Discuss ideas with engineers, involve them as much as possible in your work, and never directly criticize people for anything.
  - Bad feedback gives a clear and realistic picture of herself as others saw her, and that is all she ever needed for self-correction.
- ***Suffer fools gladly.***
  - When it comes to practical life, what should matter is getting long-term results, and getting the work done in as efficient and creative a manner as possible.
  - Fools place importance on short-term matters: grabbing immediate money, gaining attention from the public or media, and looking good.
  - The natural tendency with fools is to lower yourself to their level. Don't, you'll just waste valuable time and emotional energy.
  - Adopt this philosophy: it's just a part of life, like rocks or furniture. All of us have foolish sides anyway.

# Awaken the Dimensional Mind: The Creative-Active

- What impedes natural creative dynamics from flourishing is not a lack of talent, but your attitude. When you feel anxious and insecure, you will tend to turn conservative with your knowledge, preferring to fit into the group and sticking to the procedures you have learned.
- Instead of feeling complacent about what you know, you must expand your knowledge in related fields, giving your mind fuel to make new associations between different ideas.
  - We experience things so differently nowadays compared to how we experienced it back then. When we were younger, our minds were completely open, and we entertained all kinds of surprising, original ideas.
  - When we come to see the world through a screen of different words and opinions, and we no longer look at things as they are, and our minds tighten up, we begin to think in a conventional mind.
  - Sometimes, when we visit a different country, we cannot rely upon everything being familiar, so we become childlike again, struck by the oddness and newness of what we are seeing.
- ***Masters and those who display a high level of creative energy are people who manage to retain a sizeable portion of their childhood spirit despite the pressures and demands of adulthood.*** This spirit manifests itself in their work and in their ways of thinking: children are naturally creative, they actively transform everything around them, play with ideas and circumstances, and surprise us with the novel ideas they say or do.
  - Having a curious mind + adding years of apprenticeship + an ability to focus deeply on problems or ideas = high-level creativity. So you can have profound knowledge of a subject, and still be open to alternative ways of seeing and approaching problems.
  - Masters can combine both discipline and a childlike spirit together into what we call the "Dimensional Mind". This mind is not constricted by limited experience or habits. It can branch out into all directions and make deep contact with reality.
- Creative activity: Involves emotions, levels of energy, characters, and our minds. To make a discovery, to invent something that connects with the public, to fashion a work of art that is meaningful inevitably requires time and effort.
- Captain Ahab: Obsessed with hunting down Moby Dick, which can withstand the setbacks and failures, the days of drudgery, and the hard work that is always a part of any creative action.
- It's the choice of where to direct your creative energy that makes a master. Figuring out the electric light is not just a gimmick, but it's something that could eventually replace the gaslight, which required years of intense labor.
- Your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated directly into your work. IF you go at your work with half a heart, it will show in the lackluster results and in the laggard way in which you reach the end.
- ***If you're doing something primarily for money, it will translate into something that lacks a soul and has no connection to you. If your work comes from a place deep within, its authenticity will be communicated.***
- Think of the mind as a muscle that naturally tightens up over time unless it is consciously worked upon.
- Negative capability: enduring and embracing mysteries and uncertainties. Mozart: when he finally heard Bach's music, he didn't become defensive, he opened his mind up to new possibilities, studying Bach's use of counterpoint and absorbing it into its own vocabulary.
- Develop the habit of suspending the need to judge everything that crosses your path. Consider and entertain viewpoints opposite to your own, observe people/events for a length of time, and seek out what is unfamiliar.

- Adopting a kind of humility towards knowledge: scientific knowledge is constantly progressing. The greatest theories of the time are eventually disproven or altered at some future point. The human mind is simply too weak to have a clear and perfect vision of reality.
- Serendipity: increasing the odds of chance encounters.
- In the research stage of your project: look at more than what is generally required. The brain becomes increasingly excited and stimulated by the variety of information. Second step: maintaining an openness and looseness of spirit, doing activities outside your work, or think about something else, no matter how trivial.
- Random external stimuli lead us to associations we cannot come by on our own. Ex: choosing random words to start a novel.
- When weird shit happens, write them down. You keep the notebook wherever, and be careful to record ideas that come in moments of fringe awareness.
