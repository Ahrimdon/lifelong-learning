# The Essentialist

- Once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.
- Dieter Rams: Almost everything is noise, and very few things are essential. His job is to filter through that noise until he gets to the essence.
- "Less but better." This means pursuing what is important in a disciplined way. The way of the Essentialist is to pause constantly to ask, "Am I investing in the right activities?" There are far more activities and opportunities in the world than we have time and resources to invest in.
- *E is not about how to get more things done; it's about how to get the right things done. It doesn't mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It's about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.*
- E: living by design, not by default. Distinguish the vital few, remove obstacles.
- E thinks, does, and gets:
  - "I choose to, only a few things really matter, and what are the trade-offs?"
  - Pause to discern what really matters, says "no" to everything except the essential, and chooses carefully in order to do great work.
- How can we make the choices that allow us to tap into more of the potential inside ourselves, and in people everywhere?
- Problem: saying no is awkward, and saying yes is celebrated in the moment. This is the "paradox of success".
  - Clarity of purpose â†’ Enables us to succeed at whatever we're doing.
  - When we become successful, we gain a reputation as a "go to" person.
  - More demands for our time, which makes us get spread thinner and thinner, and we get distracted.
- Why? Too many choices, social pressure, "we can have it all".
- ***The top of the list of the most discussed regrets: "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."***
- Is there a chance I will wear this someday in the future? Do I love this? Do I look great in it? Do I wear this often? If the answer is no, then you know it's a candidate for elimination.

- What is the core mindset of an essentialist?
  - ***Individual choice: we can choose how to spend our energy and time.*** Without choice, there is no point in talking about trade-offs.
  - ***The prevalence of noise: almost everything is noise, and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.*** Because some things are so much more important, the effort in finding those things is worth it.
  - ***The reality of trade-offs.***

- ***Explore: What do I feel deeply inspired by? What am I particularly talented at? What meets a significant need in the world?***
- Eliminate.
- Execute.
- Push back vs time-wasting e-mail chains, sucky projects, unproductive meetings so they can be used at their highest level of contribution to their companies and in their careers?
- Stop celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance-celebrate how much time we spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives.
- Vision: people living a life true to themselves instead of the life others expect of them. People learning to better tap into more of their intelligence, capability, resourcefulness, and initiative to live more meaningful lives.
- ***Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?***
- ***Will you wake up one day and say, "I wish I had been less true to myself and had done all the non-essential things others expected of me?"***

# Chapter 1: Essence

- The deeply entrenched assumptions we must conquer to live the way of the E: "I have to", "it's all important", and "I can do both". To embrace the essence of E requires replacing these false assumptions with three core truths: "I choose to", "Only a few things really matter", and "I can do anything but not everything".

# Chapter 2: Choose

- If you could do only one thing with your life right now, what would you do?
- You have to emotionally know that you can do things. You might be sacrificing your power by choosing to make a bad choice.
- Learned helplessness: common with so many people.

# Chapter 3: Discern

- The unimportance of practically everything: Animal Farm/Boxer the horse. His answer to everything is: "I will work harder."
- Pareto principle/20% of the efforts produce 80% of the results.
- Distinguish: the "trivial many" from the "vital few".
- Warren Buffett: Just bet heavily on the right investments (90% of his wealth on 10 investments).
- Power law theory: certain efforts produce exponentially more results than others.
- An Essentialist discerns more so he can do less.

# Chapter 4: Trade-Off

- Southwest Airlines: Flying only point-to-point flights. No serving meals. No assigning seats in advance. Only offering coach, no first class. They were made by design.
- Southwest had a coherent strategy that made them not compromise the quality of their service.
- Instead of asking, "what do I give up", ask, "what do I want to go big on?"

# Escape

- People can't figure out what is essential if they're constantly on call. They need space to figure out what really matters.
- Hiding places: No tech. Just a place for people to think and focus.
- Isaac Newton: 2 years of solitary confinement to make Principia Mathematica.
- CEO of LinkedIn: 2 hours of blank space on the calendar each day to think.

# Look

- Journalism is not about regurgitating the facts, but figuring out the point.
- Keep a journal: think of this as a storage device for backing up our brains' faulty hard drive. I suggest reading about your writing every few months to see how the trend of your writing has changed.

# Select

- If you rate something less than 90%, reject it.
