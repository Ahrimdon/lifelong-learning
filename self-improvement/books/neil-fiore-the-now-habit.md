# The Now Habit

- Procrastination is a habit you develop to cope with anxiety about starting or completing a task.
- It is your attempted solution to cope with tasks that are boring or overwhelming.
- When you use the Now Habit strategies to lower your anxiety, fears, and self-doubts, you can stop using procrastination as an escape and can double your productivity and, often, double your income.
- When you learn to work efficiently—in the Flow State or Zone, using more of your brain-cell power—you have less reason to avoid important, top-priority tasks.

## INTRODUCTION

- The typical procrastinator completes most assignments on time, but the pressure of doing work at the last minute causes unnecessary anxiety and diminishes the quality of the end result.
- ***The procrastination habit catches people in a vicious cycle: get overwhelmed, feel pressured, fear failure, try harder, work longer, feel resentful, lose motivation, and then procrastinate. The cycle starts with the pressure of being overwhelmed and ends with an attempt to escape through procrastination.***
  - As long as you're caught in the cycle, there is no escape.
  - You can't even enjoy the recuperative and creative benefits of guilt-free leisure time.
  - Suddenly, any time spent on play—and even time spent on more enjoyable work—feels like an uneasy shirking from what you should be doing.
  - By negatively affecting the way you think and feel about work, leisure, yourself, and your chances for success, procrastination becomes a part of your identity.
- ***Instead, you can cultivate the Now Habit: the ability to put aside the fear of failure, the terror of feeling overwhelmed, and low self-esteem, and focus your mind on what you can start now. The skills and strategies of the Now Habit program will let you think of yourself as a producer, feel like a producer, and act like a producer.***

## A NEW DEFINITION OF PROCRASTINATION

- People don't procrastinate just to be ornery or because they're irrational. They procrastinate because it makes sense, given how vulnerable they feel to criticism, failure, and their own perfectionism.
- To overcome procrastination you need a positive attitude about the human spirit.
- ***This spirit's inherent motivation and curiosity has gotten us out of our caves and into condos, up from the comfort of crawling to the risks of standing and walking. The human spirit drives us to what Maslow calls our "need for meaningful work, for responsibility, and for creativeness." If we can harness it, it will ease the fears that cause procrastination and open entirely new horizons for human achievement.***
- ***The Now Habit is based on the fact that somewhere in your life there are leisure activities and forms of work that you choose to do without hesitation. You are more than "a procrastinator." You do not procrastinate twenty-four hours a day. When you turn your attention toward what you love to do—activities that foster your spontaneity, motivation, and curiosity—you know that you are more than a procrastinator, more than just lazy. With these experiences you can begin to shed your identity as a procrastinator and reconnect with your innate human drive to produce and make a contribution.***
- Your work should not be associated with pain and humiliation. When pain, pain, resentment, hurt, and fear of failure have become associated with certain kinds of tasks, it's easy to lose motivation. At this point, your self-criticism seems justified.
- ***Procrastination is not the cause of our problems with accomplishing tasks; it is an attempt to resolve a variety of underlying issues, including low self-esteem, perfectionism, fear of failure and of success, indecisiveness, an imbalance between work and play, ineffective goal-setting, and negative concepts about work and yourself.***

### The Now Habit's definition of procrastination: Procrastination is a mechanism for coping with the anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or decision.

- Those most vulnerable to procrastination: those who feel the most threatened by difficulty in starting a project, criticism, failure, and the loss of other opportunities that may result from committing to one project.

### THE NOW HABIT

- Advice such as "just do it," "try harder," and "get organized" is based on the old definition: "Your problem is procrastination. If only you weren't so lazy you could do it."
- Other advice: "This is a really tough job. You're going to have to work really hard."
- ***The Now Habit program emphasizes healing the underlying self-alienation—the working against yourself—that results from early training and cultural conditioning.***
  - It cuts through the crippling assumptions of the Puritan work ethic—that your production determines your worth—and the negative Freudian views of human drives—that a "lower self" must be subdued and disciplined by society.
  - Guilt-free play: attacks the underlying causes of work by lowering resentment towards work, making it easier to start working.

### Ten Tools

1. Creating safety will show you how to put a psychological safety net under your high-wire act so that you can lessen your fear of failure and learn how to bounce back from mistakes with renewed purpose.
2. Reprogramming negative attitudes through positive self-talk will help you to identify your negative messages to yourself and discover how they adversely affect you, while replacing them with positive phrasing that directs your energy toward task-oriented thoughts and rapid solutions.
3. Using the symptom to trigger the cure will show you how to use old habits to evoke and strengthen the formation of new, positive habits.
4. Guilt-free play will teach you how to strategically schedule your leisure time in order to shift your focus from work to play, thereby creating a subconscious urge to return to work.
5. Three-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar will show you how to control the terror of being overwhelmed by important tasks by creating a step-by-step calendar of your path to achievement, with adequate time to rest and to fully appreciate your accomplishments.
6. Making worry work for you will show you how developing plans for coping with distractions will help you achieve your goals and strengthen your ability to face the worst that could happen.
7. The Unschedule will let you see the freedom awaiting you through prescheduled guilt-free play, will create a realistic image of the amount of time available, and will give you a built-in time clock for recording quality time on projects to let you see how much you've accomplished.
8. Setting realistic goals will help you to clear your mind of guilt-producing goals that cannot be worked on in the present, and will direct your energies toward the few worthwhile goals that deserve your attention now.
9. Working in the flow state will bring you beyond stress and low motivation to a state of focused energy, interest, and concentration within two minutes or less—letting you know that regardless of how you feel about your project, within moments you will be working at your most productive and creative levels.
10. Controlled setbacks will prepare you for setbacks so that you quickly turn them into opportunities, anticipate the temptation to procrastinate, and build persistence into your overall plan for achievement.


## 1. WHY WE PROCRASTINATE

"The healthy individual has an appetite for fruitful activity and for a high quality of life." - GEORGE BERNARD SHAW

- ***Your strategic program begins with identifying your procrastination patterns so you can apply the appropriate techniques for replacing them with the effective work patterns of producers.***

### WARNING SIGNS OF PROCRASTINATION

- ***Does life feel like a long series of obligations that cannot be met? Do you- keep an impossibly long "to do" list?***
  - Do you talk to yourself in "have to's" and "should's"?
  - feel powerless, with no sense of choice?
  - feel agitated, pressured, continually fearful of being caught procrastinating?
  - suffer from insomnia and have difficulty unwinding at night, on weekends, and on vacations (if in fact you take vacations)?

- ***Are you unrealistic about time? Do you- talk about starting on projects in vague terms such as "sometime next week" or "in the fall"?***
  - lose track of how you spend your time?
  - have an empty schedule without a clear sense of commitments, plans, sub-goals, and deadlines?
  - chronically arrive late at meetings and dinners?
  - fail to take into account the actual time it takes to drive across town during rush hour?

- ***Are you vague about your goals and values? Do you- find it difficult to stay committed to any one person or project?***
  - have difficulty knowing what you really want for yourself, but are clear about what you should want?
  - get easily distracted from a goal by another plan that seems to be free of problems and obstacles?
  - lack the ability to distinguish between what's the most important use of your time and what's not?

- ***Are you unfulfilled, frustrated, depressed? Do you- have life goals that you've never completed or even attempted?***
  - fear always being a procrastinator?
  - find that you're never satisfied with what you accomplish?
  - feel deprived—always working or feeling guilty about not working?
  - continually wonder "Why did I do that?" or "What's wrong with me?"

- ***Are you indecisive and afraid of being criticized for making a mistake? Do you- delay completing projects because you try to make them perfect?***
  - fear taking responsibility for decisions because you're afraid of being blamed if something goes wrong?
  - demand perfection even on low-priority work?
  - expect to be above mistakes and criticism?
  - worry endlessly about "what if something goes wrong"?

- ***Are low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness holding you back from becoming productive? Do you- blame outside events for your failures because you're afraid to admit to any deficiencies?***
  - believe "I am what I do" or "I am my net worth"?
  - feel ineffective in controlling your life?
  - fear being judged and found wanting?

- The fact is that most of us who consider ourselves procrastinators meet deadlines and avoid serious penalties.
- But we feel so rushed, so pressured, and so unhappy with the results that we have to admit we have inordinate difficulties with any frightening or unpleasant task.
- Our real distress comes from the constant anxiety of delaying, from guilt about the inferior quality of projects completed at the last minute, and from deep regrets about life's missed opportunities.

### A POSITIVE VIEW OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT

- "Why do you procrastinate?" We say we are "lazy", but every one of us has motivations for other parts of our lives.
- Suzanne Kobasa: Her research on "The Hardy Personality" tells us that the more optimistic interpretations of human functioning are often left out of theories about how people cope.
- Norman Cousins: Anatomy of an Illness and The Healing Heart, the body has a resilient healing system.
- Denis Waitley: "Psychology of Winning and The Joy of Working" ***"We procrastinate when we fear a threat to our sense of worth and independence. No one does it to feel bad, but to temporarily relieve deep inner fears."***
- Theodore Rubin, "Compassion and Self-Hate", re deep inner fears:
  - Fear of failure.
  - Fear of being imperfect.
  - Fear of impossible expectations.
- **Procrastination is not a character defect; rather, it is an attempt at coping with the incapacitating fear of having our worth held up for judgment.**
- ***The fear of judgment is the key fear that stems from over-identifying who you are, your worth as a person, with your work. From this fear follows the counterproductive drive toward perfectionism, severe self-criticism, and the fear that you must deprive yourself of leisure time in order to satisfy some unseen judge.***

### OUR WORST CRITIC: OURSELVES

- This early family pattern is typical of many procrastinators. Praise is often withheld because "it might go to your head," leaving the child with a sense that their efforts are never good enough.
  - Early in life they learn that all they can expect from finishing a project is criticism or so-called constructive feedback on how it might be improved.
  - What's clearly being communicated is: "There's no rest for you.
  - You'll always need to keep trying.
- Her early training taught Clare that part of her was lazy and that this part would need discipline, pressure, and threats in order to do all the hard work that awaited her.

- Alice Miller, For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence:
  - Poisonous pedagogy teaches the child low self-esteem and negative attitudes toward work.
  - Clare had learned her attitudes about work and her abilities when she was too young to think for herself. Now that she was an adult, I wanted her to decide consciously which attitudes and assumptions made sense to her.

- Keep track of when and why you procrastinate to make you more aware of when the old vies were most likely to lead her into negative patterns.
- From those entries, make a list of the most frequent negative self-statements. Develop positive challenges to replace them and to redirect her focus towards the task at hand.

### PROCRASTINATION IS REWARDING

- It rewards us with temporary relief from stress.
- Procrastination to lessen our fear of being judged.
- Drs. Frederick Kanfer/Jeanne Phillips, Learning Foundations of Behavior Therapy:
  - A reward usually follows procrastination.
  - This reduces tension by taking us away from something we view as painful or threatening.
  - ***The more painful work is for you, the more you will try to seek relief through avoidance or through involvement in more pleasurable activities. The more you feel that endless work deprives you of the pleasure of leisure time, the more you will avoid work.***

### Examples of Reward

- It gets done by someone else.
- The thing you wanted to buy goes on sale.
- Procrastination often goes unpunished. Ex, classes getting suspended.
- When you took some time to cool down, you were able to avoid serious arguments with parents, teachers, bosses, and friends.
- Difficult decisions will eventually resolve themselves if you wait for additional information or allow the opportunities to pass.

- ***Generally we are taught that procrastination is the problem, rather than a symptom of other problems. This diagnosis, instead of directing your efforts toward ending the cycle of pressure, fear, and procrastination, unfortunately makes matters worse by blaming you for choosing such an awful habit.***
  - ***When we identify our worth with our work ("I am what I do") we naturally are reluctant to face challenges and take risks without self-protective defenses. If you believe that a judgment of your work is a judgment of yourself, then perfectionism, self-criticism, and procrastination are necessary forms of protection.***

### Cycle of fuck

- Perfectionistic demands lead to → fear of failure → PROCRASTINATION → self-criticism → anxiety and depression → loss of confidence → greater fear of failure which leads to → stronger need to use PROCRASTINATION as a temporary escape.
- We then use it to:
  - as an indirect way of resisting pressure from authorities;
  - as a way of lessening fear of failure by providing an excuse for a disappointing, less-than-perfect performance;
  - and as a defense against fear of success by keeping us from doing our best.

### Procrastination Is Often Used Against Fear of Failure

- But a failure to a perfectionist is like a small cut to a hemophiliac.
- It doesn't seem like much to a robust person, but it can be fatal to someone whose system is overly sensitive.
- And a perfectionist is even more sensitive to failure because having his or her work judged "average" is tantamount to being considered "a failure as a person."

-*** Those who gain their sense of identity from many areas are more resilient when failing in any one area. The more complex and varied your sense of self, the less likely you are to become depressed over stress in one area."***
- The person vulnerable to stress and procrastination is saying: "This project is me. My boss or client must love it, or I'll feel rejected as a person."
- With your work bearing a weight as enormous as the determination of your worth and your future happiness, stress is inevitable.
- To avoid procrastination, she would need to create a contract with herself that whenever she made a mistake, she would remind herself of her worth, quickly forgive herself for not being perfect, and rapidly start over. In other words, Elaine learned to accept herself as being perfectly human.

### Procrastination Is Often Used to Keep You from Facing Your Fear of Success

- You find yourself in conflict over the awful choice between advancement and friends;
- Success in completing a project means facing some painful disincentives to success, such as moving, looking for a new job, or paying back student loans; and
- Success means advancement to increasing demands and a fear of ultimate failure sometime in the future.

- ***When success in our career causes conflict in our relationships, procrastination can serve as an attempt to maintain contact with two worlds that seem diametrically opposed.***
- In one of its more insidious forms, fear of success can express itself through unconscious self-defeating behavior.
- ***The drive for success involves setting a goal, making it a high priority, and then investing time and energy toward its achievement. As the demands on your time and attention become greater, friends and family may come to resent your ambitions and your success.***
- "I learned that you'll have more friends if you don't give them a reason to be jealous."
- If you find yourself in conflict between the support of friends and family or personal success, you have a terrible dilemma.
- Fear of success can be seen as a fear of delayed failure: if you succeed in one task you're sure to be moved right on to a new competitive arena where failure is even more likely.
- ***Procrastination has been learned, and it can be unlearned. Until now it's been a rewarding and necessary tool for escaping tasks that seem painful and depriving.***

## 2.HOW WE PROCRASTINATE

We all need an occasional whack on the side of the head to shake us out of routine patterns, to force us to rethink our problems, and to stimulate us to ask new questions that may lead to other right answers.

—ROGER VON OECH A WHACK ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD

- Knowing how you procrastinate is even more important than knowing why.
- You can use your awareness of negative patterns to redirect your energy toward forming positive habits.
- Identifying how you go about doing anything is essential to improving your performance.

### KNOWING HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME

- Simply procrastinate at your normal level for another week.
- Observe where your time is going. What are you doing when you're really productive?
  - Difficulties in gauging how much time it takes to complete a project, to travel across town, or to make it to a meeting on time are often part of procrastination.
  - If you find yourself chronically late, overwhelmed with details, surprised by deadlines, procrastinating on dozens of projects, and with insufficient time for recreation and relationships, you have a time-management problem.
- ***Keeping an inventory for three days of every waking activity is a way to gain control over where your time goes. Notice the total time spent on each activity.***
-  Alan Lakein, in How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, suggests using categories of most important (A), important (B), and least important (C). Certain "B" or "C" jobs, such as urgent tasks or committee work, can be used as a break from the more intense and usually more valuable "A priority" activities.
  - This system of categories and priorities lets you know when you're making progress on what's really important and when you're just putting out fires without making much progress.

- Figure out the "A" priority activities, so you can actually rewire your goals to have more time for reading and recreation.
- Maintaining your own record for a few days will give you a pretty good estimate of how you spend your time.
- As you review a typical week's activities you can total the amount of time spent on the phone, reading the mail, eating, socializing, working, and so forth.
- This will reveal patterns that you may wish to change and others that you wish to encourage or start earlier in your day.
- Or you may find that, like many people, you take more than an hour to "settle in" before really getting started.
  - To make changes, you'll need to break out of automatic pilot and start making conscious choices when you first enter your office in the morning.
  - ***Use your record to identify the events that precede procrastination or low-priority work. Knowing which events trigger negative habits will help you switch to more productive activities.***
- ***You may also discover that recording the amount of time spent on priority projects gives you greater control over where your time goes, makes it easier for you to enjoy leisure time free of guilt, and encourages you to do quality, concentrated work whenever you can.***

### THE PROCRASTINATION LOG

- Procrastination log: this allows you to get the cues to avoid falling back into your old patterns. Avoided activity -> specific thought, justification, attempted solution, and resultant thought.
- ***Think back to last week. Do you know what you did, how much time was lost, and what you were feeling that led you to procrastinate? Probably not. A log provides a system to make it easier for you to gain control of your time and your behavior patterns.***
- Ex: Maybe if the desk was too full, the guy feels overwhelmed and the guy does other things. His desk also becomes a painful reminder of all the people to whom he owed letters. Solution: replace self-criticism with a commitment to start now on accomplishing one task for a short period of time.
- ***Frank chose three times a week when he would spend at least one-half hour organizing and filing incoming mail, bills, and letters. This may sound too easy. The fact is that it is easy—after you've used the procrastination log to identify the attitudes and self-talk that are keeping you from getting started and then replaced them with a focus on one small step.***
- You will want to include as basic information the day and time that you procrastinated, the activity you postponed and its priority, your thoughts and feelings about the task, your reason for procrastinating, the type of procrastination you used, your attempts at reducing anxiety, and your resultant thoughts and feelings.
- After a few days of recording your procrastination patterns, you'll be able to identify which thoughts and feelings lead toward achievement and which ones lead toward further delay and self-rebuke.
- By breaking down your procrastination patterns in this way you equip yourself to target the thoughts and feelings that need to be guided toward production.
- You'll realize that the absurd lengths taken to procrastinate indicate how much pain you've trained yourself to associate with the task.
- You know how monumental the deprivation, self-criticism, and perfectionism have become if you find yourself compelled to clean the grout in your shower or organize your closets.
  - When high-priority projects get replaced by low-priority items on your to-do list, you can take some solace in knowing that at least you're completing a chore.
  - But you are only accomplishing low-priority tasks that offer only partial satisfaction. You will continue to procrastinate until you adopt a strategy that allows you to find full satisfaction in starting on your high-priority projects.

- Becoming aware of the specific types of tasks that give you the most trouble will prepare you to focus on the task at hand.
- Under the "thoughts and feelings" category of your procrastination log, note any underlying negative attitudes and beliefs that lead to feelings of victimhood, deprivation, pressure to be perfect, or fear of failure.

- For example, notice how you might be mentally complicating a task so that it appears overwhelming.
  - Be especially aware of how you talk to yourself and how your language leads to procrastination or production.
  - Your procrastination log will alert you to your inner dialogue and how it is helping or hindering your goal achievement.
  - The first major step out of procrastination is to become aware of how fear leads to your old patterns and how creating safety leads to productivity.

### CREATING SAFETY: THE FIRST MAJOR STEP OUT OF PROCRASTINATION

- Situation A. The task before you is to walk a solid board that is thirty feet long, four inches thick, and one foot wide.
  - You have all the physical, mental, and emotional abilities necessary to perform this task. You can do it. No problem.
  - Take a minute to close your eyes, relax, and imagine yourself in that situation. Notice how you feel about this task.
  - Are you scared or blocked in any way? Do you feel any need to procrastinate?
  - Fear of failing or making a mistake cannot be an issue here, but you might find that you delay starting out of a need to assert your independence and to resist being asked to do even a simple task such as walking a board.

- Situation B. Now imagine that the task is just the same, to walk a board thirty feet long and one foot wide, and you have the same abilities; only now the board is suspended between two buildings 100 feet above the pavement. Look across to the other end of the board and contemplate beginning your assignment.
  - What do you feel? What are you thinking about? What are you saying to yourself? Take a moment to notice how your reactions in this situation differ from those you had in situation A.
  - Notice how rapidly your feelings about the task change when the height of the board changes and the consequences of falling are greater.
- ***Of course, while you are focusing only on the danger of falling you are losing sight of the simplicity of the task and forgetting that just a moment ago you had all the ability to do it with no problem. The danger of a mistake is now so great that you must stop to consider this threat to your life. It's no longer just a job, a test, a project; it's your life, your future that's at stake.***

- Situation C. In this scene you are still on the board suspended between two buildings, 100 feet above the ground, but the building you are on is on fire!
  - What are your thoughts now? How have you changed your focus from the previous situation?
  - Remember, just a moment ago you were frozen in fright about the possibility of falling 100 feet. Do you find yourself thinking, "I've got to get across the board. No time to worry about falling or doing it perfectly, I'll do it any old way I can. Dignity and embarrassment are no longer important."
  - Most people start thinking creatively about getting across that board by whatever imperfect means they can.
  - Making a mistake and doing the job perfectly are quickly forgotten and workshop participants often say, "I'd scoot across that board on my bottom—on my hands and knees if I had to."
  - It is only the dread of something worse that gets us beyond our dread of being less than perfect and being judged.

- Notice how quickly your feelings change when you know there is a more immediate and real danger than the possibility of falling.
  - How did you do that? Are you surprised to find yourself creatively solving the problem of crossing the board, with little consideration of your fear of falling?
  - A moment ago, the mere image of a life-threatening situation may have caused you stress.
  - But notice how quickly your mind and body redirect your energy away from worry, ambivalence, and procrastination toward productive action once you've made a decision.
  - (If the image of the fire was not a great motivator for you, see how your worries about being perfect and of falling diminish when you imagine that a small child is on the other side crying for your help. Notice that human compassion and courage are additional ways in which you can overcome your fears and your habit of procrastination.)
  - Now that you have an immediate time pressure, a real deadline—the fire—you jump into the task with both feet, doing it any old way you can. You're no longer just facing a possibility or fear of pain and death, now you're confronting real pain and certain death. Now you find yourself unstuck and motivated to start moving.

### Procrastination and Anxiety Work in Five Stages

- ***You give a task or a goal the power to determine your worth and happiness.***
  - You think, "Getting this job, passing this test, dating this person will change my life and make me happy."
  - When a perfect performance or the achievement of a specific goal becomes the sole measure of your self-worth, too much is at stake to just start working without some leverage, such as procrastination, to break the equation of self-worth = performance.
  - You therefore use procrastination to protect your worth from being judged.
- ***Second, you use perfectionism to raise the task 100 feet above the ground, so that any mistakes would be tantamount to death, and any failure or rejection would be intolerable.***
  - You demand that you do it perfectly—without anxiety, with complete acceptance from your audience, with no criticism.
  - For example, many of us feel that our performance measures not only our ability but also our value as a human being.
  - If we work hard and our work isn't brilliant we feel devastated, as if we're inadequate.
  - We tell ourselves, "I don't think I'd forgive myself if I went all out and my performance, my book, or my work still wasn't good enough."
  - So we procrastinate to avoid doing our best work and to avoid our own self-criticism.
- ***Third, you find yourself frozen with anxiety as your natural stress response produces adrenaline to deal with threats to your survival.***
- ***Fourth, you then use procrastination to escape your dilemma, which brings the deadline closer, creating time pressure, a higher level of anxiety, and a more immediate and frightening threat than even your fear of failure or of criticism for imperfect work.***
- ***Fifth and last stage, you then use a real threat, such as a fire or a deadline, to release yourself from perfectionism and to act as a motivator .***

- Situation D. You're back on the board again, 100 feet above the ground, and you're still frozen by procrastination. But there's no fire this time, only a strong, supportive net, just three feet beneath the board.
  - You now know that if you fall the worst that could happen is that you might feel a little embarrassed. Falling no longer means death.
  - A mistake does not mean the end of the world. You can recover from any fall. No single mistake would mean the end for you.
- But maybe your job, your relationship, or your home is so important to you that losing it would feel like the end of the world.
  - "Whatever happens I will survive. I will find a way to carry on. I will not let this be the end of the world for me. I will find a way to lessen the pain in my life and maximize the joy."

- ***In order to maximize your performance in a stressful world, you must create a protected and indisputable sense of worth for yourself. Until you do, energy and concentration will be drained from work and put into preparing for imagined threats to your survival, and into procrastination as a means of coping.***
  - It's interesting to note how many times successful people suffer through catastrophes and bankruptcies.
  - The successful person fails many times and bounces back; but "The Failure" fails once, letting that one failure become a judgment of his or her worth, and thus, his or her identity.
  - Following the example of most successful people, you could fall many times, repeatedly using your net to bounce back in order to work for another success. With a safety net to catch you, failure and mistakes can't stop you because you won't let them take away your inner worth and drive.
- ***No book can teach you self-worth. It can only show you how to act as if you have self-worth.***

- ***You will make significant progress in your ability to work with concentration, serenity, and creativity by creating safety and compassion for your human imperfection with your guarantee to yourself: "Whatever happens, my self-worth will survive. I make myself safe."***

## 3. HOW TO TALK TO YOURSELF

It is not discipline, willpower, or pressure from others that facilitates adherence to a challenging course of action. Rather, it is the freedom to choose among alternatives, the personal commitment to a mission, and the willingness to take responsibility for the consequences of our decisions that steels the will and emboldens the spirit.

—NEIL A. FIORE THE ROAD BACK TO HEALTH

- The Now Habit system focuses on language, not because a change in language alone will change procrastination, but because how you talk to yourself represents the attitudes and beliefs that determine how you feel and act.
- ***The self-talk of procrastinators often unconsciously suggests and reinforces feelings of victimhood, burden, and resistance to authority.***
  - The images and feelings created by such language almost always result in procrastination as an act of assertiveness and rebellion.
  - By learning to challenge and replace your negative internal dialogue, you will free yourself from attitudes about your worth and abilities that are inappropriate for your current age, intellect, and power.

### COUNTERPRODUCTIVE MESSAGES

- Through a language of choice and commitment you'll learn to direct your energy toward a goal, feeling empowered rather than victimized.

- We often get caught in the trap of talking to ourselves in a self-pitying "have to" way about going to see the dentist, sending cards to friends, paying taxes, working, or facing the boss.
- These statements confirm the belief that others are making us do something against our will. The effect is to create an image of ourselves as defeated by small tasks in life, overburdened, working hard, and without joy.
- Repeated over and over again, a "have to" statement communicates to your subconscious mind- I don't want to do it.

- These messages create enormous feelings of outside pressure and of being a helpless victim—conditions ripe for the defensive use of procrastination.
- Given your healthy need to protect yourself, there will inevitably be ambivalence, resentment, and resistance to tasks that commence with "I have to."
- Attempting to deal with all the messages implicit in "I have to," your brain must simultaneously tackle two conflicting situations: providing the energy needed for the imposed task, and providing the energy to resist threats to the integrity of the self—threats to survival.
- And your body, being a faithful servant, reacts to this "damned if I do, damned if I don't" message with either the stress response (by providing high energy for "fight or flight") or the depressive response (by conserving energy for survival).
- ***The next day, Betty chose to work on a part of the annual report she hated the least and asked her boss for help with parts she found more difficult. She also promised herself that if she chose to do this report it would be her last.***

- ***As you begin to speak to yourself in a language that focuses on results rather than blame, on choice rather than have to, on what is rather than what you think should be, you will find that your body and mind cooperate by providing a level of positive energy free from the unnecessary struggles of the past and negative comparisons with the future.***

- Unfortunately, while he loved art, Don hated the management and detail side of his business.
  - When he came to me, Don had to learn to let go of the "I should have's" of the past by accepting that those things were now beyond his control.
  - I taught him how to catch the early signs of depression about lost opportunities, reminding himself to say, "Yes, they're in the past.
  - Too bad; nothing I can do now about that. But what can I do now?" He then practiced rapidly turning his attention toward one, small corrective step he could take in the present moment.
  - Don also learned to turn the stuck energy and worry about future "should's" into constructive effort by asking himself, "When is the next time I can start working toward that goal?"
  - By talking to himself in ways that disrupted his old patterns, Don became very efficient in diverting self-criticism and depression about the impossible toward something constructive that he could accomplish.
  - To avoid getting stuck in thoughts about the past or the future, you'll want to start changing your inner dialogue. To become more productive and efficient, you'll want to clearly communicate to yourself what you choose to do, and when and where you will carry out your commitment to start.

### THE POWER OF CHOICE

- Jumping out of an airplane: Watching those men who showed ambivalence on leaving the plane and hearing their bodies thump against the bulkhead helped me make my first choice: "I'm not leaving the plane that way," I said to myself.
  - I'm not going to be kicked out of this plane.
  - If I'm going to leave this plane, it will be under my own power.
  - I'm going to maximize my chances of a safe exit. The change in my feelings at that moment was quite dramatic. Stress was replaced with purposeful action; a sense of victimhood was transformed into empowerment.
- I intentionally placed my hands on the outside of the door frame to pull myself forward through that 150 mph wind and to remove any doubt about trying to stay inside.
- ***Since I was choosing to jump, I focused all my thoughts and behaviors on that act, fending aside any thoughts of not jumping or "having to" jump. I stepped up to the door with a single purpose.***
- The thrill of that first jump will always be with me, as will the memory of my joyful laughter as I safely touched down without a scratch. But what has become more important to me over the years is the lesson of empowerment that comes from changing a "have to" into a choice.

### From Resistance to Commitment

- Dieters and people who wish to quit smoking often experience a rapid shift from resistance to commitment when faced with a life-threatening situation or with pregnancy.
- In your everyday activities, listen to how images of passivity and powerlessness are created by your negative self-talk: "I have to work through lunch."
- Exercising your power of choice will give you the opportunity to redirect toward constructive effort the energy formerly blocked by feelings of victimhood and resistance.
- Are you willing to live with the consequences of not doing these things? How much freer would you feel if you made a clear decision about any of these tasks?
- Since you have made a mature commitment to the task, rather than arguing against it, you might as well be self-nurturing enough to make it as pleasant as possible.

### Learning How to Say No

- Children during their "terrible two's" learn to say no to almost everything. This is part of their cognitive and personality development—the development of a self separate from parents.
- It might also be thought of as an assertion of innate worth, a concise way of saying, "No, I don't have to do it.
- Saying no is an important practice for procrastinators. It lessens the likelihood that you'll rush into a task in order to make up for a perceived lack of worth.
- For procrastinators especially, the ability to say no is a powerful tool for exercising choice.
  - Saying no is another way of saying, "I may be imperfect, but I have enough self-respect to say, 'No, I don't have to.'"
  - It's also one way to avoid taking on too much and feeling overwhelmed. It's a way of asserting "I know you can pressure me, but you cannot threaten my sense of worth."
  - "No" can be used assertively and non-defensively, as in:- "No, I'll need time to think about that."
  - "No, I would rather have a contract with terms I know I can wholeheartedly embrace than endanger the quality of my work by compromising."
  - "No, I will not be paying that bill now, and I'm willing to pay for the privilege by incurring your interest charges."

### FIVE SELF-STATEMENTS THAT DISTINGUISH PROCRASTINATORS FROM PRODUCERS

1. ***Negative Thinking of "I have to."*** Repeated throughout your day, the phrase "I have to" will give you a sense of ambivalence and victimization that justifies procrastination.
  - Replace "I have to" with "I choose to."
  - At that moment of awareness, immediately choose to work or accept responsibility for choosing to delay.
  - Use your awareness of a negative thought or attitude to reflexively shift you to the producer's attitude of choice and power.
2. ***Negative Thinking of "I must finish."***
  - Telling yourself "I must finish" keeps you focused on the completed product somewhere in the future, without ever telling you where to start.
  - Replace "I must finish" with "When can I start?"
  - "When can I start?" is the catchphrase of the producer. And when it is impossible to start now, "When is the next time I can start?" works to preprogram you for a directed and easy start-up in the near future, with a clear picture of when, where, and on what you will be starting.
3. ***Negative Thinking of "This project is so big and important."***
  - The bigger and more overwhelming the project seems to you, the greater your tendency to procrastinate.
  - Anxiety will replace the natural tendency toward motivation and curiosity as you overwhelm yourself with all the steps involved and the image of all that's at stake on this one important project.
  - **Replace "This project is so big and important" with "I can take one small step."**

- One small step; one rough, rough draft; one imperfect sketch; one small hello. That's all I need to do now."
- You can never build a house all at once.
  - All you can do now is pour the concrete for the foundation; hammer one nail; raise a wall—one small step at a time.
  - You could never write an entire book now; you can only write one chapter, a few pages at a time.
  - A single, small step is something you know you can accomplish now.
  - When this one manageable step is compared with the colossal undertaking, it gives you time to learn, to relax, and to recuperate between a series of small steps.
  - With each step you will have time to appreciate your accomplishments, to gain perspective on your direction, and to recommit to your long-range goals.

4. ***Negative Thinking of "I must be perfect."***
  - Replace "I must be perfect" with "I can be perfectly human."
  - Accept so-called mistakes (really feedback) as part of a natural learning process.
  - You need self-compassion rather than self-criticism to support your courageous efforts at facing the unavoidable risks of doing real, imperfect work rather than dreaming of the perfect, completed project.
  - You'll want to be especially gentle with yourself as you recognize that, as a novice, you must go through awkward first steps before you achieve the assurance of a master.
  - As you learn to expect and accept imperfect early steps on your projects, you'll build in the persistence of a producer, and you'll be better prepared to bounce back because you'll have a safety net of compassion.
  - ***For procrastinators blocked by an addiction to perfectionism, I often recommend a direct attack to unlearn this insidious pattern. Try to be imperfect.*** Then watch your natural motivation for excellence take place as you appreciate the genius in your early steps and commit to the work of polishing the project.

5. ***Negative Thinking of "I don't have time to play."***
  - Replace "I don't have time to play" with "I must take time to play."
  - Knowing that you have something to look forward to in the near future—a firm commitment to recreation and time with friends—lessens the dread of difficult work.

- "I choose to start on one small step, knowing I have plenty of time for play."
  - Use your awareness of the old pattern to alert you to choose a more effective path.
  - Each time you choose to switch your energy from your procrastination self-talk to the language of the producer, you are wiring in a new track of brain cells—a new neural pathway in your brain.

## 4. GUILT-FREE PLAY, QUALITY WORK

One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon—instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our window today.

—DALE CARNEGIE

- One of the most devastating consequences of procrastination is that it leads to putting off living.
  - "Putting off living" is the most tragic form of procrastination we can engage in.
  - Both workaholics and chronic procrastinators are either working or feeling guilty about not working.
  - Marilyn Machlowitz, in her book Workaholics: Living with Them, Working with Them, and Dr. Alan A. McLean, the medical director for IBM, in his book Work Stress, indicate that many workaholics are in poor physical shape and suffer from stress, Type A behavior, and burnout.
  - Producers, on the other hand, tend to know the importance of play and the importance of enjoying it without guilt.

### THE IMPORTANCE OF PLAY

- When someone tells you their job really isn't work, they're telling you, "I don't have to force myself to come to work."
- Knowing that work will not deprive you of enjoying the good things of life, you can more easily tackle a large task without the fear of having it rule your life.
- Instead of a project being something that is too big to handle, planned, scheduled guilt-free play lets you know that now there'll be breaks and support along the way.
- One of the reasons we procrastinate is out of fear that once we start working there'll be no time for play, that work will deprive us of play and the enjoyment of life.
  - Guilt-free play offers you a way around this problem by insisting that you plan recreation in your weekly schedule. Making play a priority in your life is part of learning to overcome procrastination.
  - Adults usually think of play as being separate from learning and work.
  - But play is an essential part of every child's development and learning about work. Through play we learn the physical, mental, and social skills necessary for adult life.
  - With toys and imagination children create scenarios that prepare them for work, relationships, and conflict. Through play children express difficult feelings, negotiate and renegotiate promises, solve problems, and learn perseverance, absorption in work, and deep concentration. Some of the most essential and complex learning and "work" we ever do is achieved while playing.

- It's through play that we learn to work alone with deep concentration, having moved safely and gradually through the earlier steps of enjoying play with mother or father, to enjoying play with a toy in their presence, to playing alone with the confidence that we are loved.
  - Adults use these skills learned in childhood to work alone and sit still for hours in front of a computer terminal, a drafting desk, or an accounting ledger.
  - They call upon the mental and physical states of concentration and creativity that were learned decades earlier while playing in the security of the home.
  - Later in life they will need these experiences to face tasks that require persistent problem-solving and the risk of mistakes and rejection.

### THE PULL METHOD OF SELF-MOTIVATION

- ***When we approach a difficult project, we typically think of tackling it in big chunks that require long periods of work in isolation.***
  - But the anticipation of extended isolation from friends and recreation is likely to promote procrastination.
  - The effects of such work habits on your mind and body are similar to the experiences of prisoners in solitary confinement and subjects in sensory deprivation studies, who are wrapped like mummies to minimize sensation.
  - Each of these activities drastically reduces physical movement and visual stimulation, making the mind ripe for any anxiety created by self-criticism, fear of abandonment, and threats of failure.
- We are more likely to work productively when we can anticipate pleasure and success rather than isolation and anxiety.
  - Demanding twenty—or even four—hours of tedious work involving confinement and struggle is hardly calculated to get us motivated, especially when there are so many more pleasurable alternatives available.
  - Given the choice between completing your income taxes and seeing an old friend, the odds are strongly in favor of the old friend—unless you have a strategy.
  - ***When attempting to motivate yourself to start working on a goal, do you push yourself toward the goal with threats, or do you use your attraction to the goal to pull you forward? Unfortunately, most people use a "push method" of motivation and are unaware that there are alternatives.***

- The "push method" of management assumes that humans are basically lazy and that scaring the hell out of them will create motivation.
- The "pull method," on the other hand, assumes that we are naturally inquisitive, and if we are properly rewarded for our efforts we can persevere with even the most difficult of tasks.
  - The "pull method" recognizes that distant and indefinite rewards, such as a possible job after four years of training, have very little power to motivate a person to continually face difficult, overwhelming tasks.
  - The promise of future rewards for hard work has little control over what we choose to do now.
  - Instead, the more immediate and definite rewards of life, such as leisure, seeing friends, and eating ice cream, are immediately and definitely followed by tangible pleasures and have, therefore, a higher probability of occurring.

- This model of motivation indicates that there's a low chance that you'll start to work on a task whose immediate results are isolation and pain, and whose rewards are uncertain and in the distant future. It also indicates that the chances of choosing this kind of work over leisure activities are even slimmer.
  - ***If, therefore, you are interested in tackling a large task and minimizing procrastination, you must structure the rewards so as to increase the probability that you will start on the task each day.***
  - ***If you're a manager, you would also want to structure the work environment so that employees receive satisfaction from working together and having a common goal, from helping others, and from compliments for progress made each week, as well as from the certainty of the monthly paycheck.***

### FROM GUILT-FREE PLAY TO QUALITY WORK

- As you include guilt-free play among your tools for overcoming procrastination, you will find that insights come to you throughout your day.
  - Suddenly you find that playing golf, jogging, reading a novel, or talking to a friend provides rich metaphors for your sales program, for negotiating a contract, for your presentation to the board of directors, or for achieving your goal of quitting smoking.
- Carlos was a classic example of someone committed to guilt-free play and optimal performance at work. Not only was his recreation enjoyable, it was a source of some of his best ideas and most creative solutions.
- This emphasis on the importance of play is not meant to deny the need for work and perseverance.
  - It recognizes the importance of work, only it's not the traditional idea of "work."
  - The usual concept of work separates it from play and implies an inner conflict in which work is seen as something you must force yourself to do.
  - The type of work and commitment that is more compatible with the Now Habit is a commitment to a mission that focuses your energies and brings about inner harmony, a commitment that comes from a pull toward a goal and an excitement about the process of getting there.

## 5. OVERCOMING BLOCKS TO ACTION

- Procrastination, by enabling you to avoid what you fear, is a phobic response to work that is associated with worry, struggle, failure, and anxiety.
  - When it is your sole defense against something you fear, procrastination becomes a difficult habit to unlearn.
  - To cope effectively with these blocks to action, you'll need alternatives to the addictive and counterproductive solution offered you by procrastination.

### THREE MAJOR BLOCKS

- The terror of being overwhelmed.
- The fear of failure.
- The fear of not finishing.

###TOOL #1: THREE-DIMENSIONAL THINKING AND THE REVERSE CALENDAR

- When you survey the task before you, you will commonly experience a surge of energy (stress or anxiety) as your body tries to be in several places at once along the imagined course of your project.
  - Being overwhelmed by a large or important task is a form of psychological and physical terror.
  - Conquering the feeling of being overwhelmed starts with anticipating that it is natural to experience a certain amount of anxiety as you picture all the work involved in completing a large project.
  - It is important not to misinterpret this as a sign that you can't do it.

### The Reverse Calendar

- I call this the reverse calendar.
  - With your own personal deadlines stretched into the future, you've taken some control over the work and created some breathing space in between each step.
  - This revised image of your project enables you to use your other tools to focus in the present, where you can start on the first step.
  - That extra energy that you needed in your attempt to do it all at once couldn't be released into the imagined future, so you experienced it as anxiety and stress.
  - But with your mind focused on the here and now, where work can be started, your body provides the right level of energy to start and you experience it as excitement and effectiveness.

### TOOL #2: THE WORK OF WORRYING

- Once a threat is raised it must be dealt with to avoid worry and anxiety—that trapped energy that can't be used productively now.
- Until you reach a solution or cancel the threat, worrying can operate like a recurrent nightmare that repeats a puzzle or problem.
- Plans, action, and solutions are required to direct the energy and complete the work of worrying.
- ***Breaking through this block to action requires that you go beyond just scaring yourself with images of potential catastrophes. You need to do the work of worrying to direct the energy of worry and panic into plans to remove the threat.***

2. *What would I do if the worst really happened? Instead of just saying that it would be awful, I must consider: Where would I get help? What would I do to cope with getting upset and losing control? Then what would I do? And what would I do after that? I must continue to ask myself, "And then what would I do?" until I know that regardless of what happens, I will continue to do my best to carry on. I want to be able to say, "There's no event so terrible that it can stop me."*

3. *How would I lessen the pain and get on with as much happiness as possible if the worst did occur? I must remember those strengths I can build on, strengths that have gotten me through situations in the past that seemed impossible at first.*

4. *What alternatives would I have?* Have I limited my options by insisting on only one perfect job and by being dictatorial about how I think my life should be?

5. *What can I do now to lessen the probability of this dreaded event occurring?* Is there anything I have been procrastinating on—a telephone call, a letter, a meeting—that I need to face in order to lessen worry, create safety, and start me working?

6. *Is there anything I can do now to increase my chances of achieving my goal?*

- True confidence is knowing that whether you're calm or anxious, whether you succeed or fail, you'll do your best and, if necessary, be ready to pick yourself up to carry on and try again. True confidence is the ability to say, "I am prepared for the worst, now I can focus on the work that will lead to the best."

### TOOL #3: PERSISTENT STARTING

- Laura was a strong starter in every aspect of her life, including jogging.
- As it turns out, it was her commitment to jogging and the running of a marathon (guilt-free play) that brought home the attitude change and the motivation to complete her master's degree project.
- When, just beyond the nineteenth mile, Laura experienced the pain of her body screaming for nutrients, she knew she had hit her wall.
- ***"I'm in pain. It hurts to run and it hurts to just stand here. It hurts to walk and it would hurt to lie down. Regardless of what I do, it hurts, so I might as well run and get it over with as soon as possible."***
- *What Laura realized is that it takes work to procrastinate and it takes work to face your fear of finishing. There's really no escape from some form of work.*

### Prepare Challenges to Negative Statements and Attitudes

1. *"I need to do more preparation before I can start."*
  - To overcome this tendency, label as procrastination any tendency to run to the boss for advice or run to the library for outside solutions or further preparation.
  - Remind yourself, as Laura did, that there's no escape from work: there's work involved in doing more preparation; there's work involved in completing the project; and there's work involved in trying to escape through procrastination.
  - So why not choose the work of taking one more step forward?

2. *"At this rate I'll never finish."*
  - The rate of learning and accomplishment in the beginning of a project is often slower than you're accustomed to.
  - Remember that later on, when you are more familiar with the subject matter and more confident in your new situation, it will go faster.
  - As you climb a mountain you can see further.
  - Your learning curve can climb very rapidly, especially when you use positive self-statements to keep your attention focused on the task rather than on self-criticism.
  - Create a positive expectation that as you make progress on your project there will be large jumps in your learning and your ability.
  - You cannot judge your rate of progress by your current ability or knowledge. As you come closer to finishing your project you will see that your confidence and your ability have been transformed.
3. *"I should have started earlier."*
  - You got started and you need to appreciate that.
  - This project may be larger than you initially anticipated.
  - Break the project into sections interspersed with legitimate breaks and planned vacations.
  - Keep your commitment to guilt-free play.
  - This is not the time for criticism and images of deprivation.
  - Make sure you reward every step of progress, regardless of how small.
4. *"There's only more work after this."*
  - The incentive for completing your current project isn't going to be there if you envision "success" as tying you slavishly to future drudgery.
  - Keep this work separate from your decision about future projects.
  - Make a commitment to yourself that you will exercise as much choice as possible about future steps.
5. *"It's not working."*
  - Self-talk such as "I'm trying, but it's not working. What's wrong?" can indicate perfectionism and a failure to do the work of worrying to develop alternative plans to make this project succeed in spite of difficulties.
  - A certain amount of discomfort is natural in stretching beyond your comfort zone into a new level of skill.
6. *"I only need a little more time."*

### Keep On Starting

- The task of finishing has its own qualities of tying things up and polishing, but essentially, all large tasks are completed in a series of starts.
  - Your skills at overcoming the blocks to action will help you finish. Use these strategies and your recognition of negative self-talk to conquer your terror of being overwhelmed, fear of failure, and fear of finishing.
  - Keep on starting, and finishing will take care of itself. When you're afraid of finishing, keep asking, "When can I start?"

## 6. THE UNSCHEDULE

- Trying to escape work by procrastinating will only increase your anxiety; only work will diminish your anxiety.
- The Unschedule asks you to aim at starting for just thirty minutes. That's right.

### EVEN PRODUCERS NEED A SYSTEM

- In my search for a practical system, I discovered that B. F. Skinner, the founder of modern behaviorism, had a time clock connected to his chair.
  - Whenever he sat down to work, he "punched in."
  - Whenever he left his chair the clock stopped, as if he were "punching out"—as I did when I worked at a supermarket, and like the "billable hours" that lawyers and architects use to keep track of the time to charge their clients.
  - This very prolific writer used a time clock! He maintained flow charts that amounted to giving himself a gold star every time he completed a small segment of work! This amazed me. I said to myself, "If B. F. Skinner has to use a system, then so do I."
- Unschedule: keeping track of your time spent on doing meaningful things.
- Because the Unschedule gave me a clear picture of how I spent my time, I know that I averaged fifteen concentrated and productive hours of work a week for one year on that dissertation, with plenty of time for skiing, jogging, and socializing with friends.
- The Unschedule is a weekly calender of committed recreational activities that divides the week into manageable pieces with breaks, meals, scheduled socializing, and play.
  - In addition, it's a record of your productive, uninterrupted work.
  - It provides producers with a prescheduled commitment to guilt-free time for recreation, plus a realistic look at the actual time available for work.
  - This method of scheduling encourages you to start earlier on your project, because you now realize how little time is actually available for work after you deduct daily chores, meetings, commuting, meals, sleep, and leisure.
  - In addition, starting is easier because thirty minutes of work is too little to be intimidating, while it is enough to make a good start and to receive a break or reward.
  - Thirty minutes reduces work to small, manageable, rewardable chunks that lessen the likelihood that you will feel overwhelmed by the complexity and length of large or menacing projects.
- Schedule recreation, leisure quality times.
  - This avoids generating the image of a life devoid of fun and freedom.
  - This reverses the process, beginning with an image of play and a guarantee of your leisure time.
  - It gives you immediate and frequent rewards following short periods of work, rather than delaying a sense of accomplishment until the task is completed.
  - The habit of recording each period of work gives you a visible reward that allows you to see how much concentrated, uninterrupted work you have completed each day and each week.
  - ***Thirty minutes of steady work is enough to give you a sense of accomplishment without creating the fear of failure that often accompanies the scheduling of longer, less realistic periods of work that are seldom achieved or even started because they're so overwhelming.***

### REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY

- Among its other strategies, the Unschedule turns our natural resistance to structure and authority—one of the principle causes of procrastination—against itself and enlists it in the cause of productivity.
- The Unschedule and the guilt-free play system help you to put more time into your leisure and more quality into your work.
- It tells you to make sure you've scheduled enough time for high-quality, guilt-free play.

- Do not work more than twenty hours a week on this project.
- Do not work more than five hours a day on this project.
- You must exercise, play, or dance at least one hour a day.
- You must take at least one day a week off from any work.
- Aim for starting on thirty minutes of quality work.
- Work for an imperfect, perfectly human first effort.
- Start small.

- ***Our usual habit is to schedule our work time and to leave our play reasonably unstructured. By requiring you to schedule and stick to recreational time, and to limit your work activity at first to predetermined periods of thirty minutes, the Unschedule builds up a subconscious desire to work more and play less.***

### HOW TO USE THE UNSCHEDULE

1. ***Schedule only:***
  - previously committed time such as meals, sleep, meetings
  - free time, recreation, leisure reading
  - socializing, lunches and dinners with friends
  - health activities such as swimming, running, tennis, working out at the gym
  - routine structured events such as commuting time, classes, medical appointments
  - Fill it with as many non-work activities as possible, just so you know that you have the right amount of hours per day.
  - Do not schedule work on projects. Remember, first and foremost, that the Unschedule guarantees your guilt-free play and the legitimacy of your personal time.

2. ***Fill in your Unschedule with work on projects only after you have completed at least one-half hour.***
  - Think of the Unschedule as a time clock that you punch in as you start work and punch out when you take credit for your progress.
  - You want to maintain an excitement about how much you've accomplished in a short period of time rather than anxiety about how much more there is to do.
  - You can also use your thirty-minute commitment as your own deadline to motivate you to work more efficiently.

3. ***Take credit only for periods of work that represent at least thirty minutes of uninterrupted work.***
  - Do not record the time on your Unschedule if you stop before thirty minutes are up.
  - The discipline of staying with the task through the first few minutes of potential distractions and inertia is necessary to carry you through to involvement and interest in your work.
  - This mounting achievement will build your pride and confidence in yourself as a producer.

4. ***Reward yourself with a break or a change to a more enjoyable task after each period worked.***
  - You deserve it. You got started!
  - And by overcoming inertia, you have begun to build momentum that will make it easier to get started next time.
  - By rewarding yourself this way for each positive achievement, you are creating positive associations with your work instead of negative ones.

5. ***Keep track of the number of quality hours worked each day and each week. Total them up. Emphasize what you did accomplish. This is rewarding in itself and establishes a positive pattern by following work with a pat on the back.***
  - It also alerts you to those days—for example, Wednesdays—when you will want to start earlier on your high-priority projects to increase the number of hours worked in a particular day.

6. ***Always leave at least one full day a week for recreation and any small chores you wish to take care of. Avoid the feeling of resentment and the burnout that can come when there are no holidays because of work.***
  - Include family rituals of recreation and play in each week.
  - You will feel more motivated to return to your high-priority projects after resting.
  - Work will be less of a burden when you are experiencing the better parts of life now, and your life is not on hold because of work.

7. ***Before deciding to go to a recreational activity or social commitment, take time out for just thirty minutes of work on your project.***
  - Any pleasurable or frequent activity you engage in has the power to create motivation for the activity it follows.
  - By using this "Grandma's Principle"—you get your ice cream only after you eat your spinach—you can get started with less pain and foster the building of good habits.
  - Soon you'll find that work that previously was difficult or unpleasant is easier and more enjoyable.

8. ***Focus on starting.***
  - The advantage of this is that your "to do" list needs only one top priority item: "When is the next time I can start?".
  - Replace all thoughts about finishing with thoughts about when, where, and on what you can start.

9. ***Think small.***
  - Do not aim to finish a book, write letters, complete your income tax, or to work continuously for even four hours.
  - Aim for thirty minutes of quality, focused work.

10. ***Keep starting.***
  - When it is time to start the last thirty minutes that will finish the project, that too will be an act of starting—the start of the conclusion of your current project, as well as the beginning of your next.
  - So forget about finishing. If you must worry, worry about starting. In order to finish, all you have to do is to just keep starting!

11. ***Never end "down."***
  - That is, never stop work when you're blocked or at the end of a section. Remember "Grandma's Principle": to create good habits your breaks and treats must follow some work.
  - Never take a break (a reward) when you're at the end of a segment or when you're ready to give up.
  - Always stay with a tough spot for another five or ten minutes, trying to come up with at least a partial solution that you can pursue later.
  - You'll find that staying with a difficulty for a few more moments is often enough for your brain to creatively resolve it.
  - Gently pushing through a block or starting on the next section before you quit creates positive momentum, making it much easier to get started next time, thus eliminating the need to procrastinate.

### ADJUSTING YOUR UNSCHEDULE

- Within two weeks of using the Unschedule you can expect a broader awareness of your work patterns—their strengths and weaknesses—and of how you're spending your time.
- For example, you most likely will observe that as you structure more leisure activities into your schedule, these periods of guilt-free relaxation will lessen the terror of being overwhelmed by large work projects.
- You'll find that pre-scheduled breaks and commitments to lunch and exercise help you to see important projects in manageable parts, interspersed with adequate time to catch your breath.

- Over the years, I've found that there are three or four discoveries everyone seems to make when they begin to use the Unschedule:
  - You're probably busier than you thought.
  - You may need to set your own priorities, be more discriminating about urgent versus important tasks, drop or delegate some projects, and make more hours available for your primary goal.
  - Certain days are less productive than others.
    - Make note of the days on which you're losing time to activities such as watching TV or unscheduled visitors to your office.
    - Be especially alert to distractions on those days.
  - Other days are so busy that you need to lower your expectations about getting started on a big project.

- Even a half-hour of work on your project is enough to maintain momentum and avoid the extra burden of having to overcome inertia tomorrow.
- Without a record of your legitimate commitments to leisure, you're more apt to feel guilty about lost time or to feel depressed when you see blank spaces on your schedule and can't remember how you spent the time.
  - You may prefer to have a consistent time at which to start each day.
  - This can make it easier to create a healthy habit.
  - Schedule a specific half-hour for starting on your major project as early as possible in your day.
  - Use your most frequent, "high-occurrence" behaviors (generally your favorite activities) as motivation tools to increase and reinforce any positive habit you want to strengthen.
    - Conversely, if balancing the books, writing, or painting comes before watching TV, eating, or sleeping, a positive habit is formed.
    - As these achievements become associated with pleasure, you'll engage in them more easily and frequently.

- Using the Unschedule provides five major benefits that lead to greater enjoyment of guiltfree play and overcoming procrastination.

1. ***Realistic timekeeping.***
  - By first recording all your committed time—such as sleep, meals, exercise, classes, meetings, laundry, and reading—you become acutely aware of how much time is really left for working on your stated goals.
  - This rapidly cures the fantasy of "having all week" and the awful surprise of "I forgot that my parents were visiting."

2. ***Thirty minutes of quality time.***
  - By aiming at starting (rather than finishing) for just thirty minutes, there is a greater likelihood that you won't feel overwhelmed.
  - When you start on a different task one step at a time for short periods, you can achieve a sense of accomplishment sooner than if you set big goals with distant rewards.
  - Every half-hour can be used to get something done or at least something organized, so that starting is easier next time.
  - By starting small you will have more opportunities during your day to chip away at the big, long-term goals, participate fully in life, and experience the power of your creative faculty working in the background while you complete other tasks and enjoy your well-deserved recreation.

3. ***Experiencing success.***
  - By recording time worked, you see your progress rather than your failure to meet an unrealistic schedule.
  - By scheduling rewards or alternative activities, you lessen the deprivation associated with work and begin to experience it as something that gives you pride and allows you to fully enjoy your leisure time.

4. ***Self-imposed deadlines.***
  - Deadlines often create a certain amount of productive pressure, but they're usually too late to allow for quality work.
  - Any student knows the benefits of cramming under the gun of the deadline: studying or writing must be efficient, to the point; work is done with full attention and the excitement of being creative under pressure.
  - The deadline not only clarifies the time frame, it indicates when you will be rewarded for your efforts or punished for your failure.
  - *And with the Unschedule system, the consequence of completing one-half hour or more of quality work is that you get to maintain your commitment to your health, your friends, or other "to-do" list items—without guilt.*
  - Getting a reward after a short period of work greatly increases your positive associations with work and increases the tendency to return to the work project—that is, it helps you form a positive habit.

5. ***Newfound "free time."*** One of the many fringe benefits of pre-scheduling your leisure activities is that, when one of them is canceled, you can suddenly find yourself thinking with relief, "I have free time; I can work."
  - Previously, trying to make yourself work during that time would have been very difficult.
  - But now whenever you unexpectedly find yourself with time on your hands, you'll be reaping the benefits of reverse psychology; you'll experience that wonderful and often surprising sense of motivation to get something started.
  - When you've lived as a chronic procrastinator (telling yourself that you're lazy and, perhaps, worthless), it is quite a pleasant shock to discover that you actually want to do some work with your newfound free time.


## 7. WORKING IN THE FLOW STATE

New research is leading to the conclusion that these instances of . . . [being fully absorbed in a challenging task] are, in effect, altered states in which the mind functions at its peak, time is often distorted, and a sense of happiness seems to pervade the moment.

—DANIEL GOLEMAN THE NEW YORK TIMES

- Learning to work creatively and knowing that you can tap into creative states at will can lessen the drudgery of work and increase your excitement about how you work.
- Peak performers in sports, music, medicine, and business have these experiences when they are fully absorbed with almost effortless attention in a challenging task.
- Psychological and physical health benefits, invigoration, and relaxed alertness have been attributed to these states.

### USING MORE OF YOUR BRAIN

- Getting into the flow state as a precondition for work helps you to bridge the gap between the linear and the creative functions of your brain.
- *This process is as natural as the "willing suspension of disbelief" (temporarily putting aside the critical faculty of your logical mind) that lets you enjoy a movie or book without continually being reminded that what's happening is not real.*
- I don't envy the job of film critics who, while trying to get lost in a delightful film, must constantly retrieve their critical faculty to evaluate the lighting, acting, music, and camera angles.

You can tell that your critical functions are getting in the way of your creative side if you hear yourself saying:

- "But is this the right direction?"
- "Will it be good enough?"
- "What if the boss/teacher/audience isn't happy with it?"
- "Can I do it?"
- "I have to finish soon."
- "When will I ever learn to start earlier?"
- "There's so much to do."

- For you to work creatively, and very rapidly, the critical and logical functions of your brain must be temporarily suspended to allow the creative functions to start the flow of ideas and inspiration that you need.
  - Later, the left side can organize them to fit the requirements of the project or customer.
  - In order for this shift to take place, concerns about perfection, accuracy, and acceptance must be put aside temporarily.
  - The procrastination mind-set, with its threatening images of potential failure and loss of approval, will halt creativity and impede access to the higher, most recently developed functions of the brain, turning the potential joy of the creative process into frustration.
  - Trying to be creative (or to relax and concentrate) can become almost impossible if the so-called practical part of your brain is attempting to supervise, criticize, and fix every possible error before your intuitive side has had a chance to gain confidence at an awkward or unpleasant task.
  - Yet, if properly used, the creative, right hemisphere of your cerebral cortex in just seconds can provide more than enough ideas and images to fill a book or make a movie.

### IT'S ONLY YOUR FIRST DRAFT

The pleasure of creativity is the greatest pleasure in the world. —SAMMY KAHN ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING SONGWRITER

- ***In occupations that rely heavily on creativity, the early renderings of a project must be protected from overly critical comparison with the ideal and ultimate goal.***
- The early drafts and sketches of great writers and artists reflect the same nonlinear, seemingly disorganized creative process we all experience when we start a new project.
- Their initial offerings, like our own, require progressive polishings and reordering before the work reaches its final form.
- By observing how the geniuses struggle with early versions of their work, we can speed up our progress through the awkward beginning stages of overcoming procrastination and blocks in our work.
- *Students entering Harvard, for example, are brought to a special section of the library where the rough drafts of famous authors are kept. This exercise has quite an impact on young writers who previously thought that the work of geniuses arrived complete and leather-bound in a single stroke of inspiration.*
  - Here, the freshmen can examine how a successful writer often starts with an apparently random series of ideas centered around a theme; many of these ideas later proved superfluous to the final design, but were essential to the process of developing a new concept.
  - That is, the early drafts are not discarded like mistakes, but are viewed as the initial steps in unfolding the idea.
  - The linear ordering of ideas comes later, as a second process, to communicate the original experience in a sequence that can be appreciated by the reader. In the first draft, the last part completed often becomes the introduction of the final version, and the initial concepts of the draft become the conclusion.

### LEARNING TO FOCUS

- Focusing is a two-minute procedure for shifting rapidly to the flow state by replacing guilt and stress with a stress-free focus on the present.
- If you are new to relaxation techniques, you will gain more from this two-minute procedure after first experiencing profound relaxation through the use of a longer exercise, such as the one on page 155.
- Meditation drill.
  - With each breath I become more alert, curious, and interested.
  - I'll be going beyond discomfort and worry to starting with purpose and commitment in just a few seconds of clock time.
  - Becoming more and more alert and ready to begin as I tap into the inner wisdom of my mind and many alternative solutions
  - Coming all the way up to full alertness, operating at a genius level with the support of my entire brain and my creative faculty, ready and eager to begin.

- With each breath I am tapping into my creative self, opening more and more of my brain power to my task.
- My conscious mind may not know yet what to do, just as it doesn't know how a puzzle will look until it's finished.
- I may not know how I'm going to do this, but soon something will come to me and then a little bit more.
- And I will find that process very interesting, because while I don't know yet what the solution will be, I do know that I will do it and that part of me already knows how to do it.
- It will also be interesting to see how time feels different at this level of the mind, and to wonder about how much I will accomplish in such a short period of clock time.

- If you've been procrastinating out of fear of confronting a boss, employee, or loved one, the next version of the exercise will be valuable in getting unstuck from negative patterns of social interaction.
  - I create the feeling of a warm, golden glow around me, an atmosphere that protects me from any distracting words and attitudes of others, and even from any negative thoughts of my own.
  - I have all the time in the world to consider thoughts and remarks or to push them aside and to return my focus toward positive attitudes and my chosen goals. My thoughts and actions convey to others that I am their ally—not their enemy or problem. Others can only help me.

### RELAXATION EXERCISE

### INCORPORATING FLOW STATES INTO YOUR PROGRAM

- You know how to give yourself clear, resolute statements such as "I will be at my desk at 3:00 P.M. for thirty quality minutes, with great curiosity and interest," "I choose to start at 8:00 A.M. by writing one more letter," "At 10 I will find one file and stay with it for at least fifteen minutes," "I can start on a small part of the budget by 11:30 A.M., and really look forward to lunch."
- ***These statements combine the three elements of effective work imagery (when, where, and on what you will start) and imply choice, safety, and starting.***
- ***The fourth step necessary to complete the process and tap into the power of working in the flow state is one we discussed earlier in this chapter—focusing.***

## 8. FINE-TUNING YOUR PROGRESS

Great works are performed, not by strength, but perseverance. —SAMUEL JOHNSON

#### PLANNED SETBACKS

- Use planned setbacks to rehearse your reactions.
  - Watch yourself closely and make a mental record of the thoughts and anxieties that send you escaping to procrastination.
  - Go right ahead and use your preferred method of procrastinating, with full awareness that now you have the tools to control fear of work and to enhance your sense of achievement at starting.
  - Notice the warning signs of procrastination associated with this project.
  - Consciously choose to procrastinate for a few hours to observe the self-statements that lead to guilt and self-criticism.
  - Notice how this process of self-criticism leads to guilt, depression, and resentment while keeping you from paying just one bill, putting one stamp on an envelope, finding one file for your income tax.
- Your planned setback will point out when you are most likely to procrastinate. You now know where your former habits lead.
- Use your planned setback as an instant replay, observing your thoughts as if from a distance as you "wire in" the corrective Now Habit technique every time you spot a symptom of counterproductive thinking and action.

### RESILIENCE AND HARDINESS

- People who consider themselves failures have failed once and stay there.
  - A "failure" wants a guarantee before starting a project that everything will go perfectly, without any problems.
  - A successful person is willing to take reasonable risks, knowing that there are no guarantees except Murphy's Law that "if something can go wrong, it will."
  - Successful people fail many times and bounce back, refusing to let any one failure define their worth.
  - In spite of the difficulties and failures they face in life, successful people learn to be resilient and carry on.
  - They've developed a series of nets under their high-wire act that lets them know that "A mistake will not be the end of the world because I won't let it be. I will pick myself up and will try again—regardless of how embarrassed or hurt I feel."
- The possibility of setbacks is not an excuse to procrastinate. Setbacks are not another reason to worry about failure, and they certainly are not indicators of your worth as a person.
- ***You may not be responsible for causing what happens to you, but you are responsible for what you do to correct it. This powerful message contains a crucial concept that many people miss: let go of worrying about the initial cause of the problem so that you can direct your energies to where they can do the most good—on the solution.***
- First you must let go of what I call the "why-whine"—"Why did this happen to me?
  - Why am I always the one who gets the tough jobs?
  - Why can't I learn to do things right?
  - Why must I put up with so many jerks?
- What distinguishes a champion from others of comparable ability is the learned skill of bouncing back from disappointing performances.
  - Being a champion—a consistent producer—requires that you forgive yourself for errors and losing streaks while maintaining the sense of inner worth and safety necessary to solve problems and pursue your goals.

### Hardiness

- Suzanne Kobasa: Hardiness is a constellation of three personality characteristics: commitment, control, and challenge.
  - Hardy individuals, rather than feeling alienated from their work, powerless over events, or threatened by change, tend to "easily commit themselves to what they are doing," "believe that they can at least partially control events," and "regard change to be a normal challenge to development .
  - Hardy executives have an overall life plan, flexible goals, and the ability to turn stressful events into opportunities that mitigate the disruption caused by any single stressful event.
  - To build hardiness into the way you cope with work projects, you can practice attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge in leisure activities such as exercise.
  - You can use sports as a safe arena to try out building the habits of hardiness.
- Notice how much easier it is after you've completed your initial goal.
  - It won't seem as steep this time.
  - Why? Because you've already achieved your goal.
  - You don't have to walk the quarter-mile uphill; you're choosing to do it, and you're watching your energy level instead of your internal chatter about whether or not you can do it.
- ***Notice that you're not trying to trick yourself about the reality of the hill; you're just taking control over your attitude and how you talk to yourself, and that changes your experience of reality.***
  - Be aware of how difficult that last quarter-mile can be when you're thinking about finishing, knowing that it's literally an uphill battle.
  - Make note of any negative thoughts such as "I can't do it" or "This hurts too much."
  - Practice getting past these thoughts and notice how you accomplish the climb.
- ***Focusing solely on the goal is exhausting; maintaining inflexible goals makes it harder to proceed; and your energy level is affected by how you talk to yourself. You can go farther than you think you can.***
  - Whenever your thoughts about work or projects seem overwhelming or defeating ("I can't do it; I don't know how I can accomplish this task"), remember how you dealt with that same feeling when you faced the hill.
  - You really didn't know if you could do it, yet you persevered, focused on the small steps you could take, noticed a change in perspective and feeling, and completed the task of walking up the hill.
  - ***Whether it's a hill or the annual budget, how you persevere in one area will build confidence in your use of hardiness in the rest of your life.***
  - In discussing goal achievement and focusing techniques with marathon runners, I discovered that an essential part of their training as long-distance runners involves letting go of the goal and staying in the process—for over two hours.
  - Many times during the 26-mile course, runners think, "I can't do it.
  - " But they're used to this kind of distraction and have prepared themselves to use such thoughts to remind themselves to focus on what they can do now.
  - ***They are ready with a positive self-statement, such as: "I can take one more step. I'm going to finish even if I have to slow down and shuffle through the next few steps. Then I'll see if I can win."***

### CONCENTRATION: CONTROLLING DISTRACTIONS

- ***"When you can't concentrate, what are your distracted thoughts concentrating on?" The point is that you cannot not concentrate. Thus, the problem is not that you can't concentrate, but that your attention is drawn to something you'd rather not be concentrating on or worrying about.***
- Certain types of distractions, such as strong emotions, need to be dealt with immediately, but the large majority of distractions can be dealt with after you complete some quality work.
- If you are having extreme difficulty concentrating, quickly jot down any distractions on a separate pad. With the satisfaction of having started, you can—without guilt and under your own control—reward yourself by tackling those prior distractions you've written on your list.
- Listing your distracting thoughts will help you identify those that can be dismissed as simply creative ways to avoid something you're ambivalent about doing.
- For more serious distractions, it is important that you schedule a specific time to deal with them.
  - During these scheduled times you can give proper attention to the questions that have been begging for resolution.

### Types of Distractions

1. ***Strong Emotions. This deserves your immediate attention.***
  - You may be using work as an attempt to distract yourself from facing strong emotions regarding a loved one, confrontations with difficult people, or medical or financial concerns.
  - Allow yourself some time (it can be as brief as ten minutes) to think through and write down what you can do to cope with the situation or to change it.
2. ***Warnings of Danger. Real or imagined threats will interrupt your ability to concentrate by stimulating an adrenaline reaction.***
  - Remember that you have alternative ways of surviving even the worst that could happen.
  - Create a coping plan and safety net.
3. ***"To-Do" Reminders. While you're immersed in a difficult project, that quart of milk you have to buy or some other "to-do list" item will suddenly haunt you for no apparent reason.***
  - Write it down. Use these as rewards for completing your work instead of as reasons to procrastinate.
4. ***Escape Fantasies. If you anticipate long periods of deprivation, you can expect an increase in fantasies about food, sex, and vacations.***
  - Record this to plan your play..
  - Deciding to work on short, tolerable periods of work and making sure you have rewards and social events to look forward to.
5. ***UFOs—Unidentified Flights of Originality. Creative and often seductive thoughts that cannot be fathomed at this time may fly through your mind while you are working on a project.***
  - You can write them down.

## EFFECTIVE GOAL-SETTING

Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task.  —WILLIAM JAMES

- ***One of the best-kept secrets of successful producers is their ability to let go of goals that cannot be achieved or started in the near future.***
  - *If you cannot find the time or motivation to start working on that goal, let go of it, or it will keep haunting you, making you feel like a procrastinator—as if you'd failed to accomplish something important that you promised yourself you would achieve.*
- Don't let unrealistic goals be used as an occasion for self-criticism and for lapsing into identifying yourself as a procrastinator. As a producer you know which goals to wholeheartedly pursue and which ones to let go of.

### Avoiding Setbacks

- ***Step 1: Recognize the work of procrastinating.***
  - *Let go of the fantasy that you can escape work by procrastinating. There is no path in life that requires no effort.*
  - Prepare yourself for making a commitment to your goal by recognizing that there are costs involved in both working and trying to avoid work.
  - *When you commit to a goal, you're committing to a form of work that brings ongoing rewards. When you procrastinate, you're choosing a self-punishing form of work.*
  - *Clearly, work is required when you decide on a goal, commit to the path, and continually stretch beyond your current abilities toward the goal.*
  - But it also takes work to feel unfulfilled and to maintain a list of unachieved resolutions.

- ***Step 2: Freely choose the entire goal. State your goal in the form of a choice or decision: "I freely choose to work on so-and-so." or "I will work on so-and-so."***
  - If a goal is important to you, and you know you are going to accomplish it one way or another, it makes sense to freely choose all the work involved in reaching that goal—the tedious work as well as the fun parts.

- ***Step 3: Create functional, observable goals. Vague goals must be translated into something tangible you can do.***
  - A realistic goal includes an action verb, a deadline, and a cost component, usually time or money.
  - For example, "I will complete painting the house by June 1 by investing at least fifteen hours a week," or "I will lose ten pounds by December 31 by exercising thirty minutes a day and removing 300 calories a day from my meals."
  - Divide your goal into action-oriented, clearly observable subgoals. For example, "I will make fifteen calls by 1:00 P.M. Wednesday" is preferable to "Get finished by sometime next week."
  - You'll need a functional subgoal that tells you what to do today in order to get closer to that ultimate goal. Action-oriented subgoals will help you to visualize when, where, and on what you need to start each day to achieve your goal by a certain deadline.
  -* If you simply stay with your ultimate goal, as is typical of ineffective goal setting, you'll have only a vague sense of what you need to do, and there's a great danger that you will be overwhelmed by the amount of work involved.*

## 9. THE PROCRASTINATOR IN YOUR LIFE

### MANAGING PEOPLE WHO PROCRASTINATE

- Procrastination causes companies billions of dollars in lost hours of productive work and millions in training new employees to replace those who could not achieve their potential.
  - To be effective in managing people who procrastinate, you must direct them toward choice, safety, and acknowledgment for what they can do, and you must avoid making those critical statements with which procrastinators are all too familiar.
- Remember that the procrastinator's poor self-image and ineffective attempts at motivation result in a continual internal dialogue such as "I have to finish something important and do it perfectly while enduring long periods of isolation from the people and things I love."
- *To work effectively with procrastinators—and that means most people—managers must keep in mind the three main issues that are at the bottom of most procrastination problems: feeling like a victim; being overwhelmed; and fear of failure.*
- Their management style creates a pull toward the goal, focuses on starting each step, and provides adequate safety and rewards.

### COMMITMENT VS. COMPLIANCE

- Injunctions of "have to" and "should" imply a threat from an outside authority that is forcing a victim to do something against his or her will.
  - These demand messages result in feelings of powerlessness, ambivalence, resentment, and resistance that frequently find expression through procrastination.
  - Procrastination can be drastically reduced by offering employees legitimate outlets to express their power and control over work projects rather than the passive resistance of procrastination.
- Allowing employees to participate in decisions that affect their work and giving them choices over how they carry out orders creates a sense of commitment.
  - This leads to a greater sense of personal responsibility for quality work than a "take it or leave it" attitude that demands only compliance.
  - When employees can be more than victims, passively complying with demands and threats, they can drop resistance to authority and commit their motivation and creativity to getting the job done rather than avoiding punishment.

#### Inviting Commitment

- "What can you get to me in rough form by noon?"
- "I've placed you in a responsible position, and I'm depending on you to be here at nine o'clock."
- "We need to be able to trust each other's work, so I need you to follow the guidelines precisely. Let me know if you have any problems with them."
- "I have responsibility for this unit, but there are things I don't see—blind spots in my way of working—so I need your help in keeping me informed if I miss some things."

### FOCUSING ON STARTING VS. FINISHING

- They also leave the procrastinator focused on the finishing point as the goal, somewhere in the distant future, without an agreed-upon starting point.
  - With such vague commands, you could propel the perfectionist into creating a much more elaborate and expensive project than is necessary to meet your needs.
  - Effective managers understand the importance of communicating to their employees the specific action steps required to begin the task.
    - They also understand that overcoming inertia is half the battle.
    - With employees who have difficulty starting, effective managers take time to ascertain the possible causes of blocks.
    - With a three-dimensional picture of the subgoals and subdeadlines, both you and the procrastinators you supervise will know what work is due when.

#### Being Clear About Where to Start

- "When can you start on a very rough draft?"
- "I need this by next Friday. Plan to have a rough sketch to me in time for our meeting on Tuesday at ten o'clock so we can go over it together."
- "Would you draw up a rough agenda of the necessary steps for closing the Jones account, and have it for me by three o'clock? Then we can set a realistic time frame for its completion."
- "If we're going to meet that deadline of two months on the Smith case, I'll need to see at least an outline by Friday. Do you need someone to take over your other responsibilities while you get started?"

### GETTING RESULTS OR GIVING CRITICISM

- When managers criticize employees or threaten their job security in order to vent anger or in vain attempts at motivation, they are likely to impose blocks to productivity and contribute to procrastination.
- Employees who must constantly wonder, "Will this be good enough to avoid being called on the carpet again? Will I be fired if I fail?" cannot use their full capacity for productive work, because their attention is compromised by necessary worries about surviving the boss's rages and maintaining their own self-respect.

#### Needs Improvement

- "I really liked what you did with the Jones account. And I think you can achieve even better results—and avoid some tension on your next project—if you follow the usual deadlines for informing the central office."
- "Your write-up was terrific. It was clear, concise, and on target. With some minor work on the last section, it will be excellent."
- "You maintained good follow-through on the phone with Mr. Jones. And I'd like you to really cement that contact by a personal visit to his plant. Next time when you're assigned a new account, set up a site visit as soon as possible."
- "You did a good job handling the customer service problems, and I'd like to see if more can be done to prevent those complaints."

- The point of combining constructive recommendations for improvement with praise is that it tells workers more clearly which actions are correct and which ones need further effort, without causing undo stress that disrupts their ability to learn.

#### Be Decisive

- Don't be like the general who repeatedly changes his mind about where the foxholes should be dug and thus encourages malingering among his troops.
- Asking your workers to repeat difficult and complex tasks wastes their efforts and reinforces procrastination.

#### Be Fair and Frequent in Your Rewards

- William James, Harvard's and America's first professor of psychology, said that the craving to be appreciated is a deep need in human nature.
  - Use subgoals and subdeadlines to give a greater sense of achievement and as an opportunity to offer rewards or direction along the way to the completion of the big task.
  - Use scheduled meetings as opportunities to reward progress and to give constructive feedback on any movement in the desired direction: "Adams, I'm really impressed with what you have accomplished so far.
  -With a bit of polishing and the addition of some graphs, it will be an outstanding presentation. When would you like to schedule our next meeting to discuss these changes?"

### LIVING WITH A PROCRASTINATOR

- Couples have been known to fight over such issues for years, and some even split up because of missed parties and chronic procrastination.
- Being put in the role of the one who feels responsible for nagging is almost as bad as being nagged.
  - Nagging only creates resentment in both parties: a feeling of pressure from an outside authority that must be rebelled against, on the one hand, and a feeling of being manipulated into playing cop or parent on the other.
  - Being nagged often places procrastinators in the position of children, who feel diminished by being told what to do.
  - Though the procrastination patterns of a loved one may directly affect you, it is important that you not take them as personal affronts.
- ***Remember, this whole issue of being on time is your problem. Blaming the procrastinator is both ineffective and inappropriate. You will be more effective if you confess your little quirk about being on time: "I am not as adaptable and spontaneous as you are and therefore feel compelled to start now preparing for upcoming deadlines."***
