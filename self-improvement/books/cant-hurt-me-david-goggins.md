# Introduction

- Do you know how you really are and what you're capable of?
- Denial is the ultimate comfort zone.
- We make habitual, self-limiting choices. It's how our brains are wired, which is why motivation is crap.
- ***So I sought out pain, fell in love with suffering, and eventually transformed myself from the weakest piece of shit on the planet into the hardest man God ever created, or so I tell myself.***
- Heraclitus: "Out of every one hundred men, ten shouldn't even be there, eighty are just targets, nine are the real fighters, but the one, one is a warrior."
- From the time you take your first breath, you become eligible to die. You also become eligible to find your greatness and become the One Warrior. But it is up to you to equip yourself for the battle ahead. Only you can master your mind, which is what it takes to live a bold life filled with accomplishments most people consider beyond their capability.

# I Should Have Been a Statistic

- What are the current factors limiting your growth and success? Write it down.

# Truth Hurts

- You are giving up instead of getting hard. Tell the truth about the real reasons for your limitations and you will turn that negativity, which is real, into jet fuel.
- It's okay to be cruel to yourself as long as you realize you're doing it to become better. We all need thicker skin to improve in life.
- *From then on, I brainwashed myself into craving discomfort. If it was raining, I would go run. Whenever it started snowing, my mind would say, "Get your fucking running shoes on." Facing that mirror, facing myself, motivated me to fight through uncomfortable experiences, and become tougher.*
- I knew that the confidence I'd managed to develop didn't come from a perfect family or God-given talent. It came from personal accountability which brought me self-respect, and self-respect will always light a way forward.
- Remind yourself: work harder. Own it. You need thick skin to improve in life. Be truthful with yourself about where you are and the necessary steps it will take to achieve those goals, day by day.

# The Impossible Task

- *In a society where mediocrity is too often the standard and too often rewarded, there is intense fascination with men who detest mediocrity, who refuse to define themselves in conventional terms, and who seek to transcend traditionally recognized human capabilities. This is the type of person we are meant to find. The man who finds a way to complete each and every task to the best of his ability. The man who will adapt and overcome any and all obstacles.*
- The first step on the journey towards a calloused mind is stepping outside your comfort zone on a regular basis.
- Write down all the things you don't like to do or that make your uncomfortable, especially the things you know are good for you.

# Taking Souls

- Hell Week was a mind game. The instructors used our suffering to pick and peel away our layers, not to find the fittest athletes. It's to find the strongest minds. That's something the quitters didn't understand until it was too late.
- *Everything in life is a mind game. Whenever we get swept under by life's dramas, we are forgetting that no matter how bad the pain gets, all bad things end.*
- Taking souls: life is all about looking for tactical advantages. Take inventory of your mind and body. List out your insecurities and weaknesses, as well as your opponent's. Laugh at yourself along with them, which disempowers them. Feelings are just feelings. People who are secure with themselves don't bully other people. They look out for other people, so if you're getting bullied, you know you're dealing with someone who has problem areas you can exploit or soothe.
- *Choose any competitive situation: is your opponent your teacher, your coach, your boss, an unruly client? No matter how they're treating you, there is only one way to not only earn their respect, but turn the tables. Excellence.*
- Do everything exactly as they ask, and whatever standard they set as an ideal outcome, you should be aiming to surpass that.
- Dominate practice. Check the best guy on your squad and show the fuck out. That means putting time in off the field.
- Teacher: start doing work of high quality. Write papers that she didn't even assign!
- Come early to class. Ask questions. Pay attention. Show here who you are and want to be.
- Boss: work around the clock. Surpass their maximum expectations.
- **Whoever you're dealing with, your goal is to make them watch you achieve what they could never have done themselves. You want them thinking about how amazing you are. Take their negativity and use it to dominate their task with everything you've got. Take their motherfucking soul!**

# Armored Mind

- My disadvantages had been callousing my mind all along and had prepared me for that moment in that pool with Psycho Pete.
- Remembering what you've been through and how that has strengthened your mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those weak, one-second impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles.
- Whenever you decide to follow a dream, you are likely to come up with all the reasons why the likelihood of success is low. Don't let doubt into the cockpit. Tolerate doubt as a backseat driver, but if you put doubt in the pilot's seat, defeat is guaranteed.
- *Physical training is the perfect crucible to learn how to manage your thought process because when you're working out, your focus is more likely to be single pointed, and your response to stress and pain is immediate and measurable.*
- The reason it's important to push hardest when you want to quit the most is because it helps you callous your mind.
- Your character is your foundation, and when you build a bunch of successes and failures on a fucked-up foundation, the structure that is the self won't be sound. To develop an armored mind, you need to go to the source of all your fears and insecurities.
- Only when you identify and accept your weaknesses will you finally stop running from the past. Then, these incidents can be used more efficiently as fuel to become better and grow stronger.
- Visualize overcoming or achieving an obstacle. What does success look like? I'll think about it every day and that feeling propels me forward when I'm training, competing, or taking on any task I choose.
- The simple things: why are you doing this? What is driving you toward this achievement? Where does the darkness you're using as fuel come from? What has calloused your mind?
- Visualization will never compensate for work undone. You cannot visualize lies. It takes relentless self-discipline to schedule suffering into your day, every day, but if you do, you'll find that at the other end of that suffering is a whole other life just waiting for you.

# It's Not About a Trophy

- Cookie jar - your small victories are your cookies to savor, and make sure you do savor them. Celebrate your successes.
- When sit gets real, we need to draw inspiration to push through our own exhaustion, depression, pain, and misery. We need to spark a bunch of small fires to become the motherfucking inferno.
- If I could run 101 miles with zero training, imagine what I could do with a little preparation.
- Cookie jar: not just the good parts, but the life obstacles you've overcome as well. Feel what it was like to overcome those struggles, those opponents, and win. Then get to work.

# The Most Powerful Weapon

- Remember that your initial blast of pain and fatigue is the governor talking. Once you do that, you are in control of the dialogue in your mind, and you can remind yourself that you are not as drained as you think. That you' haven't given it your all.
- Goggins' laws of nature:
  - You will be made fun of.
  - You will feel insecure.
  - You may not be the best all the time.
  - You may be the only so-and-so in a given situation.
  - There will be times when you feel alone.
- Get over it. Our minds are strong, they are our most powerful weapon. If you want to be one of the few to defy the trend of being less capable than someone before us, you have to be willing to go to war with yourself and create a whole new identity, which requires an open mind.
