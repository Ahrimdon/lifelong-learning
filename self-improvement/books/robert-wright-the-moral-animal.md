# The Moral Animal

## Introduction: Darwin and Us

- The doctrine: biology doesn't much matter. Mind + culture means there is no human nature.
  - Emile Durkheim: "Human nature is merely the indeterminate material that the social factor molds and transforms."
    - The mind is passive/emotions like a father or child's love are far from being inherent in nature.
  - Behaviorism: People tend habitually do what they are rewarded for doing, and not do what they are punished for doing.
  - B.F. Skinner's Utopian novel Walden II: envy, jealousy, and other antisocial impulses were being eliminated via a regime of positive/negative reinforcements.

## Chapter 1: Darwin Comes of Age

- Victorian period: sexual repression.
- Darwin: Had a high moral code. "The highest stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control our thoughts."
- Marcus Aurelius: "Habitual thoughts become the character of the mind."
