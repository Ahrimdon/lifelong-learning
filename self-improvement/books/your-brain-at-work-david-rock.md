## Your Brain at Work, David Rock

### Scene 1

- Epidemic of overwhelm: having too much to do.
- Making decisions = prefrontal cortex.
  - Without this, you wouldn't be able to set any type of goal, control impulses, solve problems, think creatively.
  - This is the seat of all conscious interactions with the world. This makes you think things through, instead of being on "autopilot" as you go about your life.
  - It can only process so many things.
- The metaphor is that it's a stage, and to understand a new idea, you have to put the ideas for a specific amount of time to see how they'd connect to audience members. To make decisions, you hold actors onstage and compare them to one another, making judgments.
- Functions:
  - Understanding
  - Deciding
  - Recalling
  - Memorizing
  - Inhibiting (keeping actors off).
- Mental abilities consume energy too, there are some questions you can't answer while walking up a hill.
- Basal ganglia
  - Older part of the brain, highly energy efficient, and it functions beneath conscious awareness, so if you're a good driver, you can drive + think about something else.
  - Making a difficult decision can be made easier by drinking a glucose drink.
- When you're tired or hungry, it's so easy to get distracted.
- Since you have an allocated number of brain functions per day, you should allocate it well in the same way that you allocate your money. Each time you use your mental stage, allocate it to something important.

#### Prioritize Prioritizing

- Picturing solutions (something you haven't seen yet) take a lot more energy than picturing problems (because they've happened already). This is why setting goals seems so hard. People base their feelings on the future according to how they feel today, instead of assessing their mental state at the future date.
- This is also why prioritizing is hard, it involves imagining and then moving around concepts of which you have no direct experience.
- Visual constructs: more information efficient, and the brain history is good at mental imagery.
- That's why you make the prioritization.
- Change tasks not according to topic, but according to type of cognitive load required. It's like lift, then cardio, then stretching.
- Need to learn to say no to tasks that re not among your priorities.
- Ex:
  - Audio recorder to remember things.
  - Recognize what's the hardest thing to do, and do that first.

- Conscious thinking involves deeply complex biological interactions in the brain among billions of neurons.
- The most important mental processes, such as prioritizing, often take the most effort.
- Visual stuff: easier to remember.
- Schedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking.

#### Scene 2

- You have about 4 words to remember, but it has to be in a pattern that you understand. "hello world" is easier to remember than "`cqwce adszc`" even though they have the same number of letters in them.
- Relational complexity: the fewer variables you have to hold in your mind, the more effective you are at making decisions.
- The brain doesn't like it when it has to think of multiple things at once.
- Simplifying complicated ideas into core elements. "Jaws in space".
- It's actually easier to memorize things when you chunk them together (5 pairs rather than 10 numbers).

#### Scene 3

- It's easy to drive and chat with a friend on a well-traveled route, not so much if it's a new destination. Same with changing your keyboard layout.
- ***Understanding:*** creating maps in the prefrontal cortex that represent new, incoming information, and connecting these maps to existing maps in the rest of the brain.
- ***Making a decision:*** activating a series of maps in the prefrontal cortex and making a choice between those maps.
- ***Recalling:*** involves searching through the maps and bringing just the right ones into the prefrontal cortex.
- ***Memorizing:*** holding maps in attention long enough to embed them in long-term memory.
- ***Inhibiting.*** Trying not to activate certain maps.
- Constant emailing and text-messaging reduces mental capability by ten points per IQ test.
- Solution:
  - Automate as much as possible. Keyboard keystrokes.
  - Get information onstage in the best possible order.
  - Mix up your attention.
- Basal ganglia: loves patterns. Only three repetitions of a routine is enough to begin long-term potentiation (hardwiring). This is why if you drive it long enough, you free the stage up for new functions.
- Replying to the email with a smiley face. :)
- Constantly decide how long you will split your attention, then go back to focusing on one ting.

- You can only multitask easily if you are executing embedded routines.
- Catch yourself trying to do two things at once and slow down instead.
- Embed repetitive tasks where you can.

#### Scene 4

- 11 minutes on a project before being distracted (October 2005). People switch activities every 3 minutes.
- Bigger computer screen = clear winner in becoming more efficient.
- Switch off all communication devices during any thinking work.
- Internal distractions: randomly daydreaming. Ambient neural activity.
- We are the descendants of people who paid a lot of attention when there was a rustle in the bushes.
- Why people do not prefer change: because big changes have too much novelty. If the error-detection circuitry fires too often, it brings on a state of anxiety or fear.
- Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is in charge of inhibition.
- The braking system is the most fragile, temperamental, and energy-hungry region of the brain. So it works only every now and then.
- Your brain will think of things, but you always have a veto.

- When we get distracted, it's often a result of thinking about ourselves, which activates the default network in the brain.
- Being "always on" (connected to others via technology) can drop your IQ significantly, as much as losing a night's sleep.
- All times you used willpower, your brain uses the same brakes. So you can improve your mental braking system that way.

#### Scene 5

- A certain level of arousal is required for the prefrontal cortex to work at its best.
- Eustress: positive stress. You need that to get out of bed in the morning.
- If you walk in front of a bus, you will probably be more awake the rest of the afternoon. If you go to the forest, you will be calmer.
- Increase adrenaline to bring urgency to a task. ***Visualizing an activity generates a similar metabolic response to actually doing it.***
- To get interested: try out something new. Change perspectives, chat with other people. He could speak out loud about his project, listen to some jokes, call a friend he like to have a laugh with.
- Positive event: food, sex, money, positive social interactions.
- He could have focused on the possible rewards of his doing a great job on this proposal, the money he could win, and the future rewards that would come his way.
- When you don't feel that things are urgent, you don't act on it.
- Estrogen promotes the stress response, and so women are better at getting things done.
- Over-arousal:

#### Scene 6

- Impasse: you want to make a connection but you can't.
- Insight experience: lack of logical progression, instead, you ave a sudden knowing regarding the answer.
- A-duh moment: when someone is told an answer to a problem they've already solved, they read that answer faster.
- A-ha moment: solving a problem with insight yourself.
- Taking a walk: clearing your mind so you have no carry over memory from thinking. When you take a break, the active ways of thinking diminish. This is why people can see answers to problems that you can't. They aren't locked into your way of thinking yet.
- Right anterior temporal lobe: allows you to pull together distantly related information.
- Increasing happiness increases the likelihood of insight, while increasing anxiety decreases it. More anxious means its harder for you to perceive subtle signals. This is why companies such as Google create work environments that allow for fun and play.
- People who are more insightful have more awareness of their internal experience. They can observe their own thinking, and thus can change how they think.
- ARIA: awareness, reflection, insight, control.
  - Awareness: focus lightly. Put the problem on the stage, but ensure it takes up as little space as possible. Don't focus too hard.
  - Reflection: focus on your thinking process, rather than the content of thoughts. If none of your strategies are working, you can allow new strategies to emerge into awareness. Make sure your impasse sees things from a high level.
  - Insight: burst of gamma band brain waves. ***People in deep meditation have a lot of gamma waves, and people with learning difficulties have fewer ones. Someone who is unconscious has almost none.***
  - Action: The high of figuring things out.

- Hitting a mental wall:
  - Do something fun, reduce anxiety.
  - Take a break and do something light/interesting to see if an answer emerges.
  - Quiet your mind and see what is there in the subtle connections.
  - Focus on the connections between information rather than drilling down into a problem.

#### Intermission

- Self awareness: looking at yourself from another person's perspective.
- Meta-perspective: like interacting with a different person.
- Technical term: mindfulness. Ex: "I should probably stop emailing."
- Mindful Awareness Attention Scale.
  - High scores have high physical/mental health, as well as quality of their relationships.
  - Recurrence of depression could be decreased by 75% with mindfulness training.
  - Default network: when you're not thinking about anything. Planning, daydreaming. This is involved in narratives.
  - Direct experience: you are not thinking intently about the past or future, rather you are experiencing information coming into your senses in real time.
- When you focus your attention on incoming data, it reduces activation of the narrative circuitry.
- When you want to focus on your current experience, you'll find out that it's actually hard to do. Your attention keeps on wanting to drift away.
- When you get better at meditation, you get better at noticing the difference between directly experiencing something and the interpretation added by the brain.
- People high on mindfulness are more aware of their unconscious processes. By understanding your brain, you increase the capacity to change your brain.

### Act 2

#### Scene 7: Derailed by Drama

- Limbic system: tracks your emotional relationship to thoughts, objects, people, and events. It determines how you feel about the world, moment to moment.
- It unconsciously drives your behavior. Without a complete limbic system, it'd be hard for you to make decisions.
- Everything you do in life is based on your brain's determination to minimize danger and maximize reward.
- Primary threat: anything that can endanger your life. Even with words that sound pleasant or unpleasant.
- Good for us evolutionarily to be hyper vigilant. A stimulated amygdala = emotions such as anxiety.
- Limbic system fires more often when it perceives a danger compared to when it senses a reward.
- Lust (strongest toward emotion), is unlikely to make you run, but fear can do so in an instant.
- This is why positive emotional spirals are less common than downward ones, because humans walk towards, but run away.
- Things that trigger limbic system arousal: hot spots/patterns of experience stored in your limbic system and tagged as dangerous.
- Increased adrenaline when you experience fear might make you feel focused and more confident in your decisions, when your ability to make the best decisions has actually been reduced.
- When your limbic system is aroused, it reduces the resources available for prefrontal cortex functions. With arousal, it might take you longer to recall names.
- Better to have smiling faces rather than frowning ones. Your cognitive functions get worse when you have strong emotions.
- Problems with limbic system arousal:
  - When there are not enough resources for conscious processing, the brain becomes more "automatic".
  - Hard for you to think, director is gone.
  - More likely to respond negatively to situations. Because you are superconscious of the dangerous side of life, you look out for even more danger when aroused by threats.
  - Higher chance to make links where there may not be any.
- When you experience over-arousal over a long period of time, your level of markers (cortisol, adrenaline) become high.
- Before an emotion arises, you can do:
  - Situation selection: don't pitch if you suck at pitching.
  - Expressive suppression: holding your feelings down.
  - Cognitive change: phrasing it/labeling it differently. Reappraise your interpretation of an event.
- Suppressing the expression of an emotion: their memory of events is impaired, as if they are consciously focusing their attention elsewhere.
- When the participants labeled the emotional faces using words, less activity occurred in the amygdala.
- It's almost always better to express your feelings (study) if you want to decrease emotional arousal. Describe an emotion in just a word or two, and it helps reduce the emotion. Describe your emotion to reduce it.
- People who are more mindful are better re: the brain being a part of the inhibition process.
- Successful people can harness deep stress and turn it into eustress. Naming!

- Once an emotion kicks in, trying to suppress it doesn't work or makes it worse.
- Suppressing an emotion makes other people feel uncomfortable.
- Label the emotion. Symbolic, not a long dialogue, for it to reduce arousal.
- Practice noticing emotions as they arise, to get better at sensing their presence earlier.

### Scene 8

- The brain is a prediction machine. Massive resources are devoted to predicting what will happen each moment.
- Prediction is the primary function of your neocortex, and the foundation of intelligence.
- You hear + predict what you should hear, you see + predict what you should see.
- When the craving for certainty is met, there is a sensation of reward.
- Things like Sudoku and crossword are enjoyable because they give you a little rush from creating more certainty in the world, in a safe way.
- Industries devoted to resolving uncertainties: palm readers, prediction engines, forecasters.
- Uncertainty: you'll feel different when you know what a person looks like.
- Emotional regulation techniques to manage uncertainty.
- Stress from recognizing that her level of control over her work has decreased.
- The degree of control that organisms can exert over something that creates stress determines whether that stressor alters the organism's functioning.
- ***The perception of control over a stressor alters a stressor's impact.***
- Work-life balance as the main reason people start their own small businesses. Though business owners make more hours, they are able to make more of their choices.
- Finding that you have choices in a situation reduces the threats from both autonomy and uncertainty. Emily could reduce here stress over a proposal's being approved by remembering she could choose to reschedule here meeting.
- Even the smallest perception of choice can impact limbic system arousal.
- Finding a way to make a choice shifts yourself from an "away" response to a "toward" response.
- ***Decide to be responsible for your mental state rather than feel grumpy.***
- Responsibility: an ability to respond. Generate a toward response by making an active choice.
- People have to control your interpretation of the meaning of the situation, and that's what reappraisal is all about.
- Conscious control over the limbic system is possible, not by suppressing a feeling, but rather by changing the interpretation that creates the feeling in the first place.
- Reappraisals:
  - Recognize that the threatening event is no longer a threat. When you see the people in a queue, you'll realize that you aren't going to miss the flight.
  - Normalizing: when you don't have complete mental maps for things yet, you use your stage a lot. ***This is why doing change is so hard: doing things differently can bring about a negative spiral that can feel overwhelming.*** Just tell yourself that it's normal to feel overwhelmed in the first few weeks of a new job.
  - Reordering information: you can put on a positive spin on things by reconfiguring what's going on.
  - Repositioning: taking another person's perspective and changing the context through which you view a situation.
  - Someone who could not regulate his emotions well would last about an hour in most jobs. You can be calm in any situation, as long as you can reappraise.
  - Almost always, you can reposition things with appraisal.
- Is success at work based on the ability to make up false interpretations of the world instead of dealing with reality?
- Apparently, happy people perform better at many type of work. So, basically, yes?
- ***All the brain can know, it knows from inside itself.*** - Walter Freeman. All the interpretations of the world are just that, interpretations your brain has made, and ultimately just yours--then having a choice about which interpretation you might use at any moment makes more sense.
- Problem with reappraisal: expensive. You have to generate alternate modes of thinking and hold those things in your mind. Then you choose the alternative interpretation that makes the most sense, and keep focused on that.
- ***This is why it's easier to reappraise with someone else (a mentor, coach, career counselor).***
- Humor = reappraisal. It's much easier to see options when you laugh at an otherwise tough situation.
- ***It's not you, it's your brain. You can't think of a complex work situation and walk around the house at the same time. It's not you, it's your brain. You can't learn to do anything new and complex without your limbic system firing up from uncertainty. It's not you, it's your brain. You can't go into a meeting at four o'clock and expect yourself and everyone else to come up with brilliant ideas, it's not you or them, it's your brain.***

- Certainty is a primary reward or threat for the brain.
- Autonomy, the feeling of control, is another primary reward or threat for the brain.
- People who reappraise more appear to live better lives.

- Find ways to create choice and a perception of autonomy whenever you can.
- Practice reappraisal early when you feel a strong emotion coming on. You can reappraise by reinterpreting an event, reordering your values, or normalizing an event, or repositioning your perspective.
- When you're at the point of managing internal stressors, just think, "That's just my brain."

### Scene 9: When Expectations Get Out of Control

- The excitement about potentially winning creates arousal in your limbic system.
- The expectation of reward has an impact on your brain.
- Your brain orients toward events, people, and information that connects to what you have valued positively.
- Expectations alter perception. People see what they expect to see, and not see what they are not expecting.
- The brain is built to avoid threat, and so people tend to work hard to reinterpret events to meet their expectations.
- Positive expectations produce a reduction in perceived pain that rivals the effects of an analgesic dose of morphine.
- Underpromising: unexpected rewards release more dopamine than expected ones. What's bad is expecting a reward and not getting it.
- When dopamine levels are too low, the number of connections per second in the brain fails.
- You need a good level of dopamine to hold an idea in your prefrontal cortex. Obviously you need to be interested in something to learn it.
- The best way to manage your expectations is to start to pay attention to them.
- Unmet expectations: bad.
- Pay additional attention to positive expectations you know will be met for sure.
- Great athletes don't get overexcited about winning, as this ruins their concentration.

- Expectations are the experience of the brain paying attention to a possible reward or threat.
- It's common to fit incoming data into expectations and ignore data that don't fit.
- Exceeded expectations generate a strong increase in dopamine, and a strong reward response. Unmet expectations generate a large drop in dopamine level, and a strong threat response.
- A general feeling of expecting good things generates a healthy level of dopamine, and may be the neurochemical marker of feeling happy.
- Practice setting expectations a little lower.
- To stay in a positive state of mind, find ways to keep coming out ahead of your expectations over and again, even in small ways.
- ***When a positive expectation is not being met, practice reappraising the situation by remember it's your brain doing something odd with dopamine.***

## Act III: Collaborate with Others

### Chapter 10:

- The social world is deeply important to our moment-to-moment existence. A lot of background processes involve thinking about other people and yourself.
- Common mode of human interaction: distrusting others. Every little thing in this state escalates.
- As a human, you get your resources not from the wild, but from other people. So large amounts of human "real estate" are devoted to the social world.
- Her conference call went wrong because people made mistakes about the mental state of the others on the call. Without a face and body language visible, everyone misread his intent.
- Mirror neurons: work only if the person they're watching has an intent.
- People with autism are considered "mind blind." They don't accurately decipher what other people are thinking, feeling, or intending, which results in social blunders.
- On a conference call, without faces to see, the group couldn't read one another's emotions.
- If people don't have social cues to pay attention to, they can't connect with other people's emotional state.
- An abundance of social cues makes people connect more richly, perhaps in challenging ways at times. The strongest emotion in a team can ripple out and drive everyone to resonate with the same emotion, without anyone consciously knowing this is happening. The strong emotion gets attention, and what people pay attention to will activate their mirror neurons.
- If you want to collaborate well with others, you have to understand what kind of state others are in.
- People naturally tend to form safe tribes with close colleagues, because collaborating with people you don't know well is a threat for the brain. The automatic response to strangers is "don't trust them". Tendency for people to be classified as foe until proven, otherwise.
- ***When you interconnect your thoughts, emotions, and goals with other people, you release oxytocin.*** Just a spray of oxytocin increased their level of trust. This is why facilitators and trainers insist on icebreakers at the start of workshops, and why establish rapport is the first step in consulting/customer service/sales training.
- The one thing that makes people happy is the quality and quantity of their social connections.
- 30 point difference in blood pressure between those who experienced loneliness and those with healthy social connections. Loneliness could increase the risk of death from stroke and heart disease. Having friends around you reduces a deeply ingrained biological threat response.
- Having people you trust around can help you bring about insights, by broadening thinking and helping you to see your own thinking. Having friends helps you change your brain, because you get to speak out loud more often. When you speak to someone about an idea, many more parts of your brain are activated in just thinking about the idea, including memory regions, language regions, and motor centers.
- Thinking someone is a foe can even make you less smart, because you constantly get distracted by how they would think, instead of dealing with the business at hand.
- A handshake, swapping names, and discussing something in common can increase feelings of closeness by causing oxytocin to be released.
- Companies that encourage water-cooler conversations exhibit greater productivity. Increasing the quality and quantity of social connections is likely to improve productivity.

- Anytime you meet someone new, make an effort to connect on a human level as early as possible to reduce the threat response.
- Become friends with people you work with by sharing personal experiences.

### Scene 11: When Everything Seems Unfair

- Once you prime your prefrontal cortex to look out for fairness issues, they start to appear everywhere.
- Ultimatum gain: people would sort of rather prefer a fair situation rather than financial reward?
- Anterior insula = associated with disgust, and it gets activated when you feel something is unfair.
- Fairness = the need to trade efficiently?
- Unfairness packs a hefty punch, so it's easy to get upset by small injustices when you're tired, or when your limbic system already has a strong base load of arousal.
- **Because of poor emotion-regulation capacity, teens feel the threats and rewards arising from fairness very intensely.**
- Fairness is hedonically rewarding. The feeling you get from a sense of fairness is one of connecting safely with others, so it's linked to relatedness.
- Giving to others activates a greater reward response than receiving gifts of similar value.
- Fairness/expectations helps explain the delight of the kindness of strangers, as well as the intense emotions of betrayal from people close to you.
- Men don't experience empathy with someone who is in pain who has been unfair, whereas women do.
- Be open and transparent about your dealings with people, remembering that unfairness is easy to trigger.
- Find ways to sense increasing fairness around you, perhaps by volunteering or donating money or resources regularly.

### The Battle for Status

- You don't have to be best friends with people to do good work.
- Status is another major driver of social behavior. Status is another primary reward or threat.
- **Reward circuits were activated when people saw others as worse off than they.**
- Status explains why people love to win arguments, even pointless ones.
- This sort of explains why people play video games with no benefits except for points to raise their status compared to that of others.
- Being left out, being classes as "less than" others, is a universally painful experience.
- Exclusion and rejection is physiologically painful. Five different pain points in the brain when social pain is experienced.
- The reaction is to a status issue could be attacking the status back.
- People don't like to be wrong because being wrong drops your status, in a way that feels dangerous and unnerving.
- Higher-status monkeys have reduced day-to-day cortisol levels, are healthier, and live longer. Status is a significant determinant of human longevity, even controlling for education and income.
- We're wired to feel rewarded by any incremental increase in status.
- Recurring themes/narratives: ordinary people doing extraordinary things, or extraordinary people doing ordinary things.
- The feeling of high status helps you process more information with less effort.
- With the reduced threat response from the increase in positive emotions, you have plenty of resources for the prefrontal cortex to help you think on multiple levels.
- ***Help someone else feel that her status has gone up.*** Giving positive feedback, pointing out what they do well gives others a sense of increasing status, especially when done publicly.
- ***Playing against yourself.*** This makes you feel good about yourself. You can harness the power of beating the other guy without hurting anyone in the process.

#### SCARF

- Status
- Certainty
- Autonomy
- Relatedness
- Fairness
