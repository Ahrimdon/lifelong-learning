## Your Brain at Work, David Rock

### Scene 1

- Epidemic of overwhelm: having too much to do.
- Making decisions = prefrontal cortex.
  - Without this, you wouldn't be able to set any type of goal, control impulses, solve problems, think creatively.
  - This is the seat of all conscious interactions with the world. This makes you think things through, instead of being on "autopilot" as you go about your life.
  - It can only process so many things.
- The metaphor is that it's a stage, and to understand a new idea, you have to put the ideas for a specific amount of time to see how they'd connect to audience members. To make decisions, you hold actors onstage and compare them to one another, making judgments.
- Functions:
  - Understanding
  - Deciding
  - Recalling
  - Memorizing
  - Inhibiting (keeping actors off).
- Mental abilities consume energy too, there are some questions you can't answer while walking up a hill.
- Basal ganglia
  - Older part of the brain, highly energy efficient, and it functions beneath conscious awareness, so if you're a good driver, you can drive + think about something else.
  - Making a difficult decision can be made easier by drinking a glucose drink.
- When you're tired or hungry, it's so easy to get distracted.
- Since you have an allocated number of brain functions per day, you should allocate it well in the same way that you allocate your money. Each time you use your mental stage, allocate it to something important.

#### Prioritize Prioritizing

- Picturing solutions (something you haven't seen yet) take a lot more energy than picturing problems (because they've happened already). This is why setting goals seems so hard. People base their feelings on the future according to how they feel today, instead of assessing their mental state at the future date.
- This is also why prioritizing is hard, it involves imagining and then moving around concepts of which you have no direct experience.
- Visual constructs: more information efficient, and the brain history is good at mental imagery.
- That's why you make the prioritization.
- Change tasks not according to topic, but according to type of cognitive load required. It's like lift, then cardio, then stretching.
- Need to learn to say no to tasks that re not among your priorities.
- Ex:
  - Audio recorder to remember things.
  - Recognize what's the hardest thing to do, and do that first.

- Conscious thinking involves deeply complex biological interactions in the brain among billions of neurons.
- The most important mental processes, such as prioritizing, often take the most effort.
- Visual stuff: easier to remember.
- Schedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking.

### Scene 2

- You have about 4 words to remember, but it has to be in a pattern that you understand. "hello world" is easier to remember than "`cqwce adszc`" even though they have the same number of letters in them.
- Relational complexity: the fewer variables you have to hold in your mind, the more effective you are at making decisions.
- The brain doesn't like it when it has to think of multiple things at once.
- Simplifying complicated ideas into core elements. "Jaws in space".
- It's actually easier to memorize things when you chunk them together (5 pairs rather than 10 numbers).

### Scene 3

- It's easy to drive and chat with a friend on a well-traveled route, not so much if it's a new destination. Same with changing your keyboard layout.
- ***Understanding:*** creating maps in the prefrontal cortex that represent new, incoming information, and connecting these maps to existing maps in the rest of the brain.
- ***Making a decision:*** activating a series of maps in the prefrontal cortex and making a choice between those maps.
- ***Recalling:*** involves searching through the maps and bringing just the right ones into the prefrontal cortex.
- ***Memorizing:*** holding maps in attention long enough to embed them in long-term memory.
- ***Inhibiting.*** Trying not to activate certain maps.
- Constant emailing and text-messaging reduces mental capability by ten points per IQ test.
- Solution:
  - Automate as much as possible. Keyboard keystrokes.
  - Get information onstage in the best possible order.
  - Mix up your attention.
- Basal ganglia: loves patterns. Only three repetitions of a routine is enough to begin long-term potentiation (hardwiring). This is why if you drive it long enough, you free the stage up for new functions.
- Replying to the email with a smiley face. :)
- Constantly decide how long you will split your attention, then go back to focusing on one ting.

- You can only multitask easily if you are executing embedded routines.
- Catch yourself trying to do two things at once and slow down instead.
- Embed repetitive tasks where you can.
