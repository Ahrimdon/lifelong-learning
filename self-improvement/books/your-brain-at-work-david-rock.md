## Your Brain at Work, David Rock

#### Scene 1

- Epidemic of overwhelm: having too much to do.
- Making decisions = prefrontal cortex.
  - Without this, you wouldn't be able to set any type of goal, control impulses, solve problems, think creatively.
  - This is the seat of all conscious interactions with the world. This makes you think things through, instead of being on "autopilot" as you go about your life.
  - It can only process so many things.
- The metaphor is that it's a stage, and to understand a new idea, you have to put the ideas for a specific amount of time to see how they'd connect to audience members. To make decisions, you hold actors onstage and compare them to one another, making judgments.
- Functions:
  - Understanding
  - Deciding
  - Recalling
  - Memorizing
  - Inhibiting (keeping actors off).
- Mental abilities consume energy too, there are some questions you can't answer while walking up a hill.
- Basal ganglia
  - Older part of the brain, highly energy efficient, and it functions beneath conscious awareness, so if you're a good driver, you can drive + think about something else.
  - Making a difficult decision can be made easier by drinking a glucose drink.
- When you're tired or hungry, it's so easy to get distracted.
- Since you have an allocated number of brain functions per day, you should allocate it well in the same way that you allocate your money. Each time you use your mental stage, allocate it to something important.

#### Prioritize Prioritizing

- Picturing solutions (something you haven't seen yet) take a lot more energy than picturing problems (because they've happened already). This is why setting goals seems so hard. People base their feelings on the future according to how they feel today, instead of assessing their mental state at the future date.
- This is also why prioritizing is hard, it involves imagining and then moving around concepts of which you have no direct experience.
- Visual constructs: more information efficient, and the brain history is good at mental imagery.
- That's why you make the prioritization.
- Change tasks not according to topic, but according to type of cognitive load required. It's like lift, then cardio, then stretching.
- Need to learn to say no to tasks that re not among your priorities.
- Ex:
  - Audio recorder to remember things.
  - Recognize what's the hardest thing to do, and do that first.

- Conscious thinking involves deeply complex biological interactions in the brain among billions of neurons.
- The most important mental processes, such as prioritizing, often take the most effort.
- Visual stuff: easier to remember.
- Schedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking.

#### Scene 2

- You have about 4 words to remember, but it has to be in a pattern that you understand. "hello world" is easier to remember than "`cqwce adszc`" even though they have the same number of letters in them.
- Relational complexity: the fewer variables you have to hold in your mind, the more effective you are at making decisions.
- The brain doesn't like it when it has to think of multiple things at once.
- Simplifying complicated ideas into core elements. "Jaws in space".
- It's actually easier to memorize things when you chunk them together (5 pairs rather than 10 numbers).

#### Scene 3

- It's easy to drive and chat with a friend on a well-traveled route, not so much if it's a new destination. Same with changing your keyboard layout.
- ***Understanding:*** creating maps in the prefrontal cortex that represent new, incoming information, and connecting these maps to existing maps in the rest of the brain.
- ***Making a decision:*** activating a series of maps in the prefrontal cortex and making a choice between those maps.
- ***Recalling:*** involves searching through the maps and bringing just the right ones into the prefrontal cortex.
- ***Memorizing:*** holding maps in attention long enough to embed them in long-term memory.
- ***Inhibiting.*** Trying not to activate certain maps.
- Constant emailing and text-messaging reduces mental capability by ten points per IQ test.
- Solution:
  - Automate as much as possible. Keyboard keystrokes.
  - Get information onstage in the best possible order.
  - Mix up your attention.
- Basal ganglia: loves patterns. Only three repetitions of a routine is enough to begin long-term potentiation (hardwiring). This is why if you drive it long enough, you free the stage up for new functions.
- Replying to the email with a smiley face. :)
- Constantly decide how long you will split your attention, then go back to focusing on one ting.

- You can only multitask easily if you are executing embedded routines.
- Catch yourself trying to do two things at once and slow down instead.
- Embed repetitive tasks where you can.

#### Scene 4

- 11 minutes on a project before being distracted (October 2005). People switch activities every 3 minutes.
- Bigger computer screen = clear winner in becoming more efficient.
- Switch off all communication devices during any thinking work.
- Internal distractions: randomly daydreaming. Ambient neural activity.
- We are the descendants of people who paid a lot of attention when there was a rustle in the bushes.
- Why people do not prefer change: because big changes have too much novelty. If the error-detection circuitry fires too often, it brings on a state of anxiety or fear.
- Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is in charge of inhibition.
- The braking system is the most fragile, temperamental, and energy-hungry region of the brain. So it works only every now and then.
- Your brain will think of things, but you always have a veto.

- When we get distracted, it's often a result of thinking about ourselves, which activates the default network in the brain.
- Being "always on" (connected to others via technology) can drop your IQ significantly, as much as losing a night's sleep.
- All times you used willpower, your brain uses the same brakes. So you can improve your mental braking system that way.

#### Scene 5

- A certain level of arousal is required for the prefrontal cortex to work at its best.
- Eustress: positive stress. You need that to get out of bed in the morning.
- If you walk in front of a bus, you will probably be more awake the rest of the afternoon. If you go to the forest, you will be calmer.
- Increase adrenaline to bring urgency to a task. ***Visualizing an activity generates a similar metabolic response to actually doing it.***
- To get interested: try out something new. Change perspectives, chat with other people. He could speak out loud about his project, listen to some jokes, call a friend he like to have a laugh with.
- Positive event: food, sex, money, positive social interactions.
- He could have focused on the possible rewards of his doing a great job on this proposal, the money he could win, and the future rewards that would come his way.
- When you don't feel that things are urgent, you don't act on it.
- Estrogen promotes the stress response, and so women are better at getting things done.
- Over-arousal:

#### Scene 6

- Impasse: you want to make a connection but you can't.
- Insight experience: lack of logical progression, instead, you ave a sudden knowing regarding the answer.
- A-duh moment: when someone is told an answer to a problem they've already solved, they read that answer faster.
- A-ha moment: solving a problem with insight yourself.
- Taking a walk: clearing your mind so you have no carry over memory from thinking. When you take a break, the active ways of thinking diminish. This is why people can see answers to problems that you can't. They aren't locked into your way of thinking yet.
- Right anterior temporal lobe: allows you to pull together distantly related information.
- Increasing happiness increases the likelihood of insight, while increasing anxiety decreases it. More anxious means its harder for you to perceive subtle signals. This is why companies such as Google create work environments that allow for fun and play.
- People who are more insightful have more awareness of their internal experience. They can observe their own thinking, and thus can change how they think.
- ARIA: awareness, reflection, insight, control.
  - Awareness: focus lightly. Put the problem on the stage, but ensure it takes up as little space as possible. Don't focus too hard.
  - Reflection: focus on your thinking process, rather than the content of thoughts. If none of your strategies are working, you can allow new strategies to emerge into awareness. Make sure your impasse sees things from a high level.
  - Insight: burst of gamma band brain waves. ***People in deep meditation have a lot of gamma waves, and people with learning difficulties have fewer ones. Someone who is unconscious has almost none.***
  - Action: The high of figuring things out.

- Hitting a mental wall:
  - Do something fun, reduce anxiety.
  - Take a break and do something light/interesting to see if an answer emerges.
  - Quiet your mind and see what is there in the subtle connections.
  - Focus on the connections between information rather than drilling down into a problem.

#### Intermission

- Self awareness: looking at yourself from another person's perspective.
- Meta-perspective: like interacting with a different person.
- Technical term: mindfulness. Ex: "I should probably stop emailing."
- Mindful Awareness Attention Scale.
  - High scores have high physical/mental health, as well as quality of their relationships.
  - Recurrence of depression could be decreased by 75% with mindfulness training.
  - Default network: when you're not thinking about anything. Planning, daydreaming. This is involved in narratives.
  - Direct experience: you are not thinking intently about the past or future, rather you are experiencing information coming into your senses in real time.
- When you focus your attention on incoming data, it reduces activation of the narrative circuitry.
- When you want to focus on your current experience, you'll find out that it's actually hard to do. Your attention keeps on wanting to drift away.
- When you get better at meditation, you get better at noticing the difference between directly experiencing something and the interpretation added by the brain.
- People high on mindfulness are more aware of their unconscious processes. By understanding your brain, you increase the capacity to change your brain.

### Act 2

#### Scene 7: Derailed by Drama

- Limbic system: tracks your emotional relationship to thoughts, objects, people, and events. It determines how you feel about the world, moment to moment.
- It unconsciously drives your behavior. Without a complete limbic system, it'd be hard for you to make decisions.
- Everything you do in life is based on your brain's determination to minimize danger and maximize reward.
- Primary threat: anything that can endanger your life. Even with words that sound pleasant or unpleasant.
- Good for us evolutionarily to be hyper vigilant. A stimulated amygdala = emotions such as anxiety.
- Limbic system fires more often when it perceives a danger compared to when it senses a reward.
- Lust (strongest toward emotion), is unlikely to make you run, but fear can do so in an instant.
- This is why positive emotional spirals are less common than downward ones, because humans walk towards, but run away.
- Things that trigger limbic system arousal: hot spots/patterns of experience stored in your limbic system and tagged as dangerous.
- Increased adrenaline when you experience fear might make you feel focused and more confident in your decisions, when your ability to make the best decisions has actually been reduced.
- When your limbic system is aroused, it reduces the resources available for prefrontal cortex functions. With arousal, it might take you longer to recall names.
- Better to have smiling faces rather than frowning ones. Your cognitive functions get worse when you have strong emotions.
- Problems with limbic system arousal:
  - When there are not enough resources for conscious processing, the brain becomes more "automatic".
  - Hard for you to think, director is gone.
  - More likely to respond negatively to situations. Because you are superconscious of the dangerous side of life, you look out for even more danger when aroused by threats.
  - Higher chance to make links where there may not be any.
- When you experience over-arousal over a long period of time, your level of markers (cortisol, adrenaline) become high.
- Before an emotion arises, you can do:
  - Situation selection: don't pitch if you suck at pitching.
  - Expressive suppression: holding your feelings down.
  - Cognitive change: phrasing it/labeling it differently. Reappraise your interpretation of an event.
- Suppressing the expression of an emotion: their memory of events is impaired, as if they are consciously focusing their attention elsewhere.
- When the participants labeled the emotional faces using words, less activity occurred in the amygdala.
- It's almost always better to express your feelings (study) if you want to decrease emotional arousal. Describe an emotion in just a word or two, and it helps reduce the emotion. Describe your emotion to reduce it.
- People who are more mindful are better re: the brain being a part of the inhibition process.
- Successful people can harness deep stress and turn it into eustress. Naming!

- Once an emotion kicks in, trying to suppress it doesn't work or makes it worse.
- Suppressing an emotion makes other people feel uncomfortable.
- Label the emotion. Symbolic, not a long dialogue, for it to reduce arousal.
- Practice noticing emotions as they arise, to get better at sensing their presence earlier.
