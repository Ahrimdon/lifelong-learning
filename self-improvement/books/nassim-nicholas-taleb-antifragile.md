# Prologue

## I. HOW TO LOVE THE WIND

- *Likewise with randomness, uncertainty, chaos: you want to use them, not hide from them. You want to be the fire and wish for the wind. This summarizes this author's non-meek attitude to randomness and uncertainty.*
- *We just don't want to just survive uncertainty, to just about make it. We want to survive uncertainty and, in addition—like a certain class of aggressive Roman Stoics—have the last word. The mission is how to domesticate, even dominate, even conquer, the unseen, the opaque, and the inexplicable.*

## II. THE ANTIFRAGILE

- Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty.
- Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile.
- The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.
  - This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance … even our own existence as a species on this planet.
  - And antifragility determines the boundary between what is living and organic (or complex), say, the human body, and what is inert, say, a physical object like the stapler on your desk.
- *The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means—crucially—a love of errors, a certain class of errors. Antifragility has a singular property of allowing us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them—and do them well. Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I'd rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time.*

### Non-prediction

- In every domain or area of application, we propose rules for moving from the fragile toward the antifragile, through reduction of fragility or harnessing antifragility.
- And we can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.

### Deprivation of Antifragility

- Crucially, if antifragility is the property of all those natural (and complex) systems that have survived, depriving these systems of volatility, randomness, and stressors will harm them.
- Just as spending a month in bed (preferably with an unabridged version of War and Peace and access to The Sopranos' entire eighty-six episodes) leads to muscle atrophy, complex systems are weakened, even killed, when deprived of stressors.
- Much of our modern, structured, world has been harming us with top-down policies and contraptions which do precisely this: an insult to the antifragility of systems.
- This is the tragedy of modernity: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most.

### Upside at the Expense of Others

- ***Which brings us to the largest fragilizer of society, and greatest generator of crises, absence of "skin in the game." Some become antifragile at the expense of others by getting the upside (or gains) from volatility, variations, and disorder and exposing others to the downside risks of losses or harm.***
- 2008: these blowup risks-to-others are easily concealed owing to the growing complexity of modern institutions and political affairs. While in the past people of rank or status were those and only those who took risks, who had the downside for their actions, and heroes were those who did so for the sake of others, today the exact reverse is taking place.
- *We are witnessing the rise of a new class of inverse heroes, that is, bureaucrats, bankers, Davos-attending members of the I.A.N.D. (International Association of Name Droppers), and academics with too much power and no real downside and/or accountability. They game the system while citizens pay the price.*
- At no point in history have so many non-risk-takers, that is, those with no personal exposure, exerted so much control.
- The chief ethical rule is the following: Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of the fragility of others.

## III. THE ANTIDOTE TO THE BLACK SWAN

- I want to live happily in a world I don't understand.
- Black Swans (capitalized) are large-scale unpredictable and irregular events of massive consequence—unpredicted by a certain observer, and such unpredictor is generally called the "turkey" when he is both surprised and harmed by these events.
- I have made the claim that most of history comes from Black Swan events, while we worry about fine-tuning our understanding of the ordinary, and hence develop models, theories, or representations that cannot possibly track them or measure the possibility of these shocks.
- Life is more, a lot more, labyrinthine than shown in our memory—our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear, which makes us underestimate randomness.
  - But when we see it, we fear it and overreact.
  - Because of this fear and thirst for order, some human systems, by disrupting the invisible or not so visible logic of things, tend to be exposed to harm from Black Swans and almost never get any benefit.
  - You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness.

- Complex systems are full of interdependencies—hard to detect—and nonlinear responses.
  - "Nonlinear" means that when you double the dose of, say, a medication, or when you double the number of employees in a factory, you don't get twice the initial effect, but rather a lot more or a lot less.
  - Two weekends in Philadelphia are not twice as pleasant as a single one—I've tried.

- Man-made complex systems tend to develop cascades and runaway chains of reactions that decrease, even eliminate, predictability and cause outsized events.
  - So the modern world may be increasing in technological knowledge, but, paradoxically, it is making things a lot more unpredictable.
  - An annoying aspect of the Black Swan problem—in fact the central, and largely missed, point—is that the odds of rare events are simply not computable.
  - We know a lot less about hundred-year floods than five-year floods—model error swells when it comes to small probabilities.

### Robust Is Not Robust Enough

- Consider that Mother Nature is not just "safe."
- It is aggressive in destroying and replacing, in selecting and reshuffling.
- When it comes to random events, "robust" is certainly not good enough. In the long run everything with the most minute vulnerability breaks, given the ruthlessness of time—yet our planet has been around for perhaps four billion years and, convincingly, robustness can't just be it: you need perfect robustness for a crack not to end up crashing the system.
- The antifragile gains from prediction errors, in the long run. If you follow this idea to its conclusion, then many things that gain from randomness should be dominating the world today—and things that are hurt by it should be gone.

- We have the illusion that the world functions thanks to programmed design, university research, and bureaucratic funding, but there is compelling—very compelling—evidence to show that this is an illusion.
  - Technology is the result of antifragility, exploited by risk-takers in the form of tinkering and trial and error, with nerd-driven design confined to the backstage.
  - ***Engineers and tinkerers develop things while history books are written by academics; we will have to refine historical interpretations of growth, innovation, and many such things.***

### On the Measurability of (Some) Things

- Fragility is quite measurable, risk not so at all, particularly risk associated with rare events.
- I said that we can estimate, even measure, fragility and antifragility, while we cannot calculate risks and probabilities of shocks and rare events, no matter how sophisticated we get.

- Risk management as practiced is the study of an event taking place in the future, and only some economists and other lunatics can claim—against experience—to "measure" the future incidence of these rare events, with suckers listening to them—against experience and the track record of such claims.
- But fragility and antifragility are part of the current property of an object, a coffee table, a company, an industry, a country, a political system.
  - We can detect fragility, see it, even in many cases measure it, or at least measure comparative fragility with a small error while comparisons of risk have been (so far) unreliable.
  - You cannot say with any reliability that a certain remote event or shock is more likely than another (unless you enjoy deceiving yourself), but you can state with a lot more confidence that an object or a structure is more fragile than another should a certain event happen.
  - Instead of a discussion of risk (which is both predictive and sissy) I advocate the notion of fragility, which is not predictive—and, unlike risk, has an interesting word that can describe its functional opposite, the non-sissy concept of antifragility.

### The Fragilista

- ***Our idea is to avoid interference with things we don't understand. Well, some people are prone to the opposite.***
  - The fragilista falls for the Soviet-Harvard delusion, the (unscientific) overestimation of the reach of scientific knowledge.
  - Because of such delusion, he is what is called a naive rationalist, a rationalizer, or sometimes just a rationalist, in the sense that he believes that the reasons behind things are automatically accessible to him. And let us not confuse rationalizing with rational—the two are almost always exact opposites.
  - Outside of physics, and generally in complex domains, the reasons behind things have had a tendency to make themselves less obvious to us, and even less to the fragilista.
  - This property of natural things not to advertise themselves in a user's manual is, alas, not much of a hindrance: some fragilistas will get together to write the user's manual themselves, thanks to their definition of "science."

- In short, the fragilista (medical, economic, social planning) is one who makes you engage in policies and actions, all artificial, in which the benefits are small and visible, and the side effects potentially severe and invisible.
  - There is the medical fragilista who overintervenes in denying the body's natural ability to heal and gives you medications with potentially very severe side effects.
  - The policy fragilista (the interventionist social planner) who mistakes the economy for a washing machine that continuously needs fixing (by him) and blows it up.
  - The psychiatric fragilista who medicates children to "improve" their intellectual and emotional life.
  - The soccer-mom fragilista;
  - The financial fragilista who makes people use "risk" models that destroy the banking system (then uses them again); the military fragilista who disturbs complex systems; the predictor fragilista who encourages you to take more risks; and many more.

- Indeed, the political discourse is lacking a concept. Politicians in their speeches, goals, and promises aim at the timid concepts of "resilience," "solidity," not antifragility, and in the process are stifling the mechanisms of growth and evolution.
  - ***We didn't get where we are thanks to the sissy notion of resilience. And, what's worse, we didn't get where we are today thanks to policy makers—but thanks to the appetite for risks and errors of a certain class of people we need to encourage, protect, and respect.***

### Where Simple Is More Sophisticated

- A complex system, contrary to what people believe, does not require complicated systems and regulations and intricate policies.
  - The simpler, the better.
  - Complications: intervention -> unforeseen consequences, then "apologies", then another intervention, etc...
  - ***Yet simplicity has been difficult to implement in modern life because it is against the spirit of a certain brand of people who seek sophistication so they can justify their profession.***
  - *Thus I will produce a small number of tricks, directives, and interdicts—how to live in a world we don't understand, or, rather, how to not be afraid to work with things we patently don't understand, and, more principally, in what manner we should work with these.* Or, even better, how to dare to look our ignorance in the face and not be ashamed of being human—be aggressively and proudly human. But that may require some structural changes.

## IV. THIS BOOK

- I suddenly realized one day that fragility—which had been lacking a technical definition—could be expressed as what does not like volatility, and that what does not like volatility does not like randomness, uncertainty, disorder, errors, stressors, etc.
  - Think of anything fragile, say, objects in your living room such as the glass frame, the television set, or, even better, the china in the cupboards.
  - If you label them "fragile," then you necessarily want them to be left alone in peace, quiet, order, and predictability.
  - A fragile object would not possibly benefit from an earthquake or the visit of your hyperactive nephew. Further, everything that does not like volatility does not like stressors, harm, chaos, events, disorder, "unforeseen" consequences, uncertainty, and, critically, time.

- And antifragility flows—sort of—from this explicit definition of fragility. It likes volatility et al. It also likes time.
  - And there is a powerful and helpful link to nonlinearity: everything nonlinear in response is either fragile or antifragile to a certain source of randomness.
- And in that strange profession of people who work with volatility, there were two types.
  - First category, academics, report-writers, and commentators who study future events and write books and papers.
  - Those who, Instead of studying future events, try to understand how things react to volatility (but practitioners are usually too busy practitioning to write books, articles, papers, speeches, equations, theories and get honored by Highly Constipated and Honorable Members of Academies).
  - It is much easier to understand if something is harmed by volatility—hence fragile—than try to forecast harmful events, such as these oversized Black Swans. But only practitioners (or people who do things) tend to spontaneously get the point.

### The (Rather Happy) Disorder Family

- Why item (ix), time? Time is functionally similar to volatility: the more time, the more events, the more disorder.
  - Consider that if you can suffer limited harm and are antifragile to small errors, time brings the kind of errors or reverse errors that end up benefiting you. This is simply what your grandmother calls experience. The fragile breaks with time.

### No Guts, No Belief

- To accord with the practitioner's ethos, the rule in this book is as follows: I eat my own cooking.
- I have only written, in every line I have composed in my professional life, about things I have done, and the risks I have recommended that others take or avoid were risks I have been taking or avoiding myself.
- I will be the first to be hurt if I am wrong.
- When I warned about the fragility of the banking system in The Black Swan, I was betting on its collapse (particularly when my message went unheeded); otherwise I felt it would not have been ethical to write about it.


- That personal stricture applies to every domain, including medicine, technical innovation, and simple matters in life.
- *It does not mean that one's personal experiences constitute a sufficient sample to derive a conclusion about an idea; it is just that one's personal experience gives the stamp of authenticity and sincerity of opinion.*
- *Experience is devoid of the cherry-picking that we find in studies, particularly those called "observational," ones in which the researcher finds past patterns, and, thanks to the sheer amount of data, can therefore fall into the trap of an invented narrative.*

- ***Further, in writing, I feel corrupt and unethical if I have to look up a subject in a library as part of the writing itself. This acts as a filter—it is the only filter. If the subject is not interesting enough for me to look it up independently, for my own curiosity or purposes, and I have not done so before, then I should not be writing about it at all, period.***

### If You See Something

- Modernity has replaced ethics with legalese, and the law can be gamed with a good lawyer.
- So I will expose the transfer of fragility, or rather the theft of antifragility, by people "arbitraging" the system. These people will be named by name. Poets and painters are free, liberi poetae et pictores, and there are severe moral imperatives that come with such freedom. First ethical rule:

- ***If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.***
  - Calling people and institutions fraudulent in print when they are not (yet) called so by others carries a cost, but is too small to be a deterrent.
  - ***Compromising is condoning. The only modern dictum I follow is one by George Santayana: A man is morally free when … he judges the world, and judges other men, with uncompromising sincerity. This is not just an aim but an obligation.***


### De-fossilizing Things

- ***I am obligated to submit myself to the scientific process simply because I require it from others, but no more than that.***
  - When I read empirical claims in medicine or other sciences, I like these claims to go through the peer-review mechanism, a fact-checking of sorts, an examination of the rigor of the approach.
  - Logical statements, or those backed by mathematical reasoning, on the other hand, do not require such a mechanism: they can and must stand on their own legs.
- -My experience is that money and transactions purify relations; ideas and abstract matters like "recognition" and "credit" warp them, creating an atmosphere of perpetual rivalry. I grew to find people greedy for credentials nauseating, repulsive, and untrustworthy.
- *Commerce, business, Levantine souks (though not large-scale markets and corporations) are activities and places that bring out the best in people, making most of them forgiving, honest, loving, trusting, and open-minded.*
  - As a member of the Christian minority in the Near East, I can vouch that commerce, particularly small commerce, is the door to tolerance—the only door, in my opinion, to any form of tolerance. It beats rationalizations and lectures. Like antifragile tinkering, mistakes are small and rapidly forgotten.
- I want to be happy to be human and be in an environment in which other people are in love with their fate—and never, until my brush with academia, did I think that that environment was a certain form of commerce.

## V. ORGANIZATION

Book I, The Antifragile: An Introduction, presents the new property and discusses evolution and the organic as the typical antifragile system. It also looks at the tradeoff between the antifragility of the collective and the fragility of the individual.

Book II, Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility, describes what happens when we starve systems—mostly political systems—of volatility. It discusses this invention called the nation-state, as well as the idea of harm done by the healer, someone who tries to help you and ends up harming you very badly.

Book III, A Nonpredictive View of the World, introduces Fat Tony and his intuitive detection of fragility and presents the foundational asymmetry of things grounded in the writings of Seneca, the Roman philosopher and doer.

Book IV, Optionality, Technology, and the Intelligence of Antifragility, presents the mysterious property of the world, by which a certain asymmetry is behind things, rather than human "intelligence," and how optionality drove us here. It is opposed to what I call the Soviet-Harvard method. And Fat Tony argues with Socrates about how we do things one cannot quite explain.

Book V, The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear (sic), is about the philosopher's stone and its opposite: how to turn lead into gold, and gold into lead. Two chapters constitute the central technical section—the plumbing of the book—mapping fragility (as nonlinearity, more specifically, convexity effects) and showing the edge coming from a certain class of convex strategies.

Book VI, Via Negativa, shows the wisdom and effectiveness of subtraction over addition (acts of omission over acts of commission). This section introduces the notion of convexity effects. Of course the first application is to medicine. I look at medicine only from an epistemological, risk-management approach—and it looks different from there.

Book VII, The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility, grounds ethics in transfers of fragility, with one party getting the benefits and the other one the harm, and points out problems arising from absence of skin in the game.

## APPENDIX: THE TRIAD, OR A MAP OF THE WORLD AND THINGS ALONG THE THREE PROPERTIES

- Note that fragile and antifragile here are relative terms, not quite absolute properties: one item to the right of the Triad is more antifragile than another to the left.
  - For instance, artisans are more antifragile than small businesses, but a rock star will be more antifragile than any artisan.
  - Debt always puts you on the left, fragilizes economic systems.
  - And things are antifragile up to a certain level of stress.
  - Your body benefits from some amount of mishandling, but up to a point—it would not benefit too much from being thrown down from the top of the Tower of Babel.
- The Golden Robust: Further, the robust here in the middle column is not equivalent to Aristotle's "golden middle" (commonly mislabeled the "golden mean"), in the way that, say, generosity is the middle between profligacy and stinginess—it can be, but it is not necessarily so. Antifragility is desirable in general, but not always, as there are cases in which antifragility will be costly, extremely so. Further, it is hard to consider robustness as always desirable—to quote Nietzsche, one can die from being immortal.

- If the designation antifragile is rather vague and limited to specific sources of harm or volatility, and up to a certain range of exposure, it is no more and no less so than the designation fragile.
  - Antifragility is relative to a given situation.
  - A boxer might be robust, hale when it comes to his physical condition, and might improve from fight to fight, but he can easily be emotionally fragile and break into tears when dumped by his girlfriend.
  - Your grandmother might have opposite qualities, fragile in build but equipped with a strong personality.

# BOOK I The Antifragile: An Introduction

## CHAPTER 1 Between Damocles and Hydra

- Almost all people answer that the opposite of "fragile" is "robust," "resilient," "solid," or something of the sort.
  - But the resilient, robust (and company) are items that neither break nor improve, so you would not need to write anything on them—have you ever seen a package with "robust" in thick green letters stamped on it?
  - Antifragile: Its contents would not just be unbreakable, but would benefit from shocks and a wide array of trauma. "Please mishandle."
  This blind spot seems universal. There is no word for "antifragility" in the main known languages, modern, ancient, colloquial, or slang. Even Russian (Soviet version) and Standard Brooklyn English don't seem to have a designation for antifragility, conflating it with robustness.2
  - Half of life—the interesting half of life—we don't have a name for.

### PLEASE BEHEAD ME

- Damocles: fragile.
- Phoenix: rebuilt and is reborn to its initial state.
- Hydra: antifragile.
- As societies gain in complexity, they become increasingly vulnerable to collapse.
- Greeks didn't have a word for blue, so they referred to the sea as "wine-dark".

- "Mithridatization": the result of an exposure to a small dose of a substance that, over time, makes one immune to additional, larger quantities of it.
  - It is the sort of approach used in vaccination and allergy medicine.
  - It is not quite antifragility, still at the more modest level of robustness, but we are on our way.
- Hormesis, a word coined by pharmacologists, is when a small dose of a harmful substance is actually beneficial for the organism, acting as medicine.
  - A little bit of an otherwise offending substance, not too much, acts to benefit the organism and make it better overall as it triggers some overreaction.
  - *Many claim that caloric restriction (permanent or episodic) activates healthy reactions and switches that, among other benefits, lengthen life expectancy in laboratory animals. We humans live too long for researchers to test if such restriction increases our life expectancy (if the hypothesis is true, then the subjects of the test would outlive the researchers).*
  - But it looks like such restriction makes humans healthier (and may also improve their sense of humor). But since abundance would bring the opposite effect, this episodic caloric restriction can be also interpreted as follows: too much regular food is bad for you, and depriving humans of the stressor of hunger may make them live less than their full potential; so all hormesis seems to be doing is reestablishing the natural dosage for food and hunger in humans. In other words, hormesis is the norm, and its absence is what hurts us.
- ***But the larger point is that we can now see that depriving systems of stressors, vital stressors, is not necessarily a good thing, and can be downright harmful.***

### DOMAIN INDEPENDENCE IS DOMAIN DEPENDENT

- This idea that systems may need some stress and agitation has been missed by those who grasp it in one area and not in another.
  - Some people can understand an idea in one domain, say, medicine, and fail to recognize it in another, say, socioeconomic life.
  - Or they get it in the classroom, but not in the more complicated texture of the street. Humans somehow fail to recognize situations outside the contexts in which they usually learn about them.
  - I had a vivid illustration of domain dependence in the driveway of a hotel in the pseudocity of Dubai. A fellow who looked like a banker had a uniformed porter carry his luggage.
  - About fifteen minutes later I saw the banker lifting free weights at the gym, trying to replicate natural exercises using kettlebells as if he were swinging a suitcase. Domain dependence is pervasive.
- We are all, in a way, similarly handicapped, unable to recognize the same idea when it is presented in a different context.
- This lack of translation is a mental handicap that comes with being a human; and we will only start to attain wisdom or rationality when we make an effort to overcome and break through it.

## CHAPTER 2 Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere

- He informed me—in response to the idea of antifragility—of a phenomenon called post-traumatic growth, the opposite of post-traumatic stress syndrome, by which people harmed by past events surpass themselves.
  - Intellectuals tend to focus on negative responses from randomness (fragility) rather than the positive ones (antifragility). This is not just in psychology: it prevails across the board.
  - ***How do you innovate? First, try to get in trouble. I mean serious, but not terminal, trouble. The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!***

### HOW TO WIN A HORSE RACE

- It is said that the best horses lose when they compete with slower ones, and win against better rivals.
  - Undercompensation from the absence of a stressor, inverse hormesis, absence of challenge, degrades the best of the best.
  - In Baudelaire's poem, "The albatross's giant wings prevent him from walking"—many do better in Calculus 103 than Calculus 101.
  - If tired after an intercontinental flight, go to the gym for some exertion instead of resting. Also, it is a well-known trick that if you need something urgently done, give the task to the busiest (or second busiest) person in the office.
  - Most humans manage to squander their free time, as free time makes them dysfunctional, lazy, and unmotivated—the busier they get, the more active they are at other tasks. Overcompensation, here again.

- Some try sending authors to "speech school"—the first time it was suggested to me I walked out, resolved to change publishers on the spot.
  - I find it better to whisper, not shout. Better to be slightly inaudible, less clear.
  - One should have enough self-control to make the audience work hard to listen, which causes them to switch into intellectual overdrive.
  - This paradox of attention has been a little bit investigated: there is empirical evidence of the effect of "disfluency." Mental effort moves us into higher gear, activating more vigorous and more analytical brain machinery.
- The same or a similar mechanism of overcompensation makes us concentrate better in the presence of a modicum of background random noise, as if the act of countering such noise helps us hone our mental focus.
  - Consider this remarkable ability humans have to filter out noise at happy hour and distinguish the signal among so many other loud conversations.
  - So not only are we made to overcompensate, but we sometimes need the noise.
  - Like many writers, I like to sit in cafés, working, as they say, against resistance.

### Antifragile Responses as Redundancy

- Layers of redundancy are the central risk management property of natural systems.
  - Redundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens—usually.
  - Now, it turns out, the same, very same logic applies to overcompensation: it is just a form of redundancy.
  - An additional head for Hydra is no different from an extra—that is, seemingly redundant—kidney for humans, and no different from the additional capacity to withstand an extra stressor.
  - And to return to the drivers of innovation: the additional quantities of motivation and willpower, so to speak, stemming from setbacks can be also seen as extra capacity, no different from extra boxes of victuals.
- Indeed, our bodies discover probabilities in a very sophisticated manner and assess risks much better than our intellects do.

- We cannot think that the tallest mountain in the world is just the tallest we've seen. We can't just say, "It never happened before."
- Starting strength/strong lifts: I know that if I lift something to so-and-so pounds, the body will expect that I will build a certain amount of additional strength as my body predicts that next time, I may need to lift more.

### Please Ban My Book: The Antifragility of Information

- ***Information is antifragile; it feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it. For instance, many wreck their reputations merely by trying to defend it.***
  - *The wily Venetians knew how to spread information by disguising it as a secret. Try it out with the following experiment in spreading gossip: tell someone a secret and qualify it by insisting that it is a secret, begging your listener "not to tell anyone"; the more you insist that it remain a secret, the more it will spread.*
- Books and ideas are antifragile: when they get banned, they are more attractive. Criticism for a book is actually good, because this means it isn't boring, and being boring is the only bad thing for a book. Ex: Ayn Rand books.
- Criticism itself can be antifragile to repression, when the fault finder wants to be attacked in return in order to get some validation. Smear campaigns, if you can survive them, help enormously.

### Get Another Job

- If the criticism harms you, get out. It is easier to change jobs than control your reputation or public perception.
- You do not want to "control" your reputation; you won't be able to do it by controlling information flow.
- Instead, focus on altering your exposure, say, by putting yourself in a position impervious to reputational damage.
- Ex: if the author beat up someone, it is very unlikely that it would hurt book sales.
- Someone with a high reputation would be very fragile, because of his dependence on his reputation.
- Information is merciless: one press conference "to tranquilize" and the investors will run away, causing a death spiral or a run on the bank.
- His stance vs government debt: if you don't have debt, then you don't care about your reputation in economics circles.

## CHAPTER 3 The Cat and the Washing Machine

- Everything that has life in it is to some extent antifragile (but not the reverse).
- Typically, the natural—the biological—is both antifragile and fragile, depending on the source (and the range) of variation. A human body can benefit from stressors (to get stronger), but only to a point.
  - Inanimate—that is, nonliving—material, typically, when subjected to stress, either undergoes material fatigue or breaks.
  - The fact that the artificial needs to be antifragile for us to be able to use it as tissue is quite a telling difference between the biological and the synthetic.
  - Your house, your food processor, and your computer desk eventually wear down and don't self-repair. They may look better with age (when artisanal), just as your jeans will look more fashionable with use, but eventually time will catch up with them and the hardest material will end up looking like Roman ruins.

- While humans self-repair, they eventually wear out (hopefully leaving their genes, books).
  - But the phenomenon of aging is misunderstood, largely fraught with mental biases and logical flaws.
  - We observe old people and see them age, so we associate aging with their loss of muscle mass, bone weakness, loss of mental function.
  - ***But these failures to self-repair come largely from maladjustment—either too few stressors or too little time for recovery between them—and maladjustment for this author is the mismatch between one's design and the structure of the randomness of the environment.***
  - What we observe in "aging" is a combination of maladjustment and senescence, and it appears that the two are separable—senescence might not be avoidable, and should not be avoided; maladjustment is avoidable.

### The Complex

- Many things such as society, economic activities and markets, and cultural behavior are apparently man-made but grow on their own to reach some kind of self-organization.
  - Artificial, man-made mechanical and engineering contraptions with simple responses are complicated, but not "complex," as they don't have interdependencies.
  - You push a button, say, a light switch, and get an exact response, with no possible ambiguity in the consequences, even in Russia.
  - With complex systems, interdependencies are severe: if you remove a specific animal you disrupt a food chain: its predators will starve and its prey will grow unchecked, causing complications and series of cascading side effects. If you shut down a bank in New York, it will cause ripple effects from Iceland to Mongolia.
- In the complex world, the notion of "cause" itself is suspect; it is either nearly impossible to detect or not really defined—another reason to ignore newspapers, with their constant supply of causes for things.

### STRESSORS ARE INFORMATION

- Your body gets information about the environment not through your logical apparatus, your intelligence and ability to reason, compute, and calculate, but through stress, via hormones or other messengers we haven't discovered yet.
- ***As we saw, your bones will get stronger when subjected to gravity, say, after your (short) employment with a piano moving company.***
- Errors and their consequences are information; for small children, pain is the only risk management information, as their logical faculties are not very developed.
- For complex systems are, well, all about information. And there are many more conveyors of information around us than meet the eye.

- Let us consider bones again. I have a thing for bones, and the idea I will discuss next made me focus on lifting heavy objects rather than using gym machines.
  - Aging causes bone weakness, but bone weakness also causes aging, diabetes, and, for males, loss of fertility and sexual function.
  - Ladies carrying jugs on their heads have outstanding health and excellent posture.
  - Such a stressor would be certainly better than the mild but continuous stress of a boss, mortgage, tax problems, guilt over procrastinating with one's tax return, exam pressures, chores, emails to answer, forms to complete, daily commutes—things that make you feel trapped in life.
  - Things that make you feel trapped in life: boss, mortgage, tax problems, guilt over procrastination, exam pressures, chores, emails, forms, daily commutes.

### CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN

- Not only are we averse to stressors, and don't understand them, but we are committing crimes against life, the living, science, and wisdom, for the sake of eliminating volatility and variation.
- On depressants: would somber things have been invented?
- There is another danger: in addition to harming children, we are harming society and our future. Measures that aim at reducing variability and swings in the lives of children are also reducing variability and differences within our said to be Great Culturally Globalized Society.
- Ex: language learning, you learn this best when you need to speak that language, not from a textbook. The best way to learn a language may be an episode of jail in a foreign country.
- Touristification: treating humans as washing machines, with a detailed user's manual. It is the removal of uncertainty and randomness from things, trying to make matters highly predictable in their smallest details.
- Ex: education system, gym machines, electronic calendar, scheduled parties, scheduled laughs.
- This "goal-driven" attitude hurts deeply inside my existential self.

### The Secret Thirst for Chance

- If you are not a washing machine or a cuckoo clock—in other words, if you are alive—something deep in your soul likes a certain measure of randomness and disorder.
- There is a titillating feeling associated with randomness: We like the moderate (and highly domesticated) world of games, from spectator sports to having our breathing suspended between crap shoots during the next visit to Las Vegas.
- If I could predict what my day would exactly look like, I would feel a little bit dead.

- Consider that all the wealth of the world can't buy a liquid more pleasurable than water after intense thirst.
  - Few objects bring more thrill than a recovered wallet (or laptop) lost on a train.
  - Further, in an ancestral habitat we humans were prompted by natural stimuli—fear, hunger, desire—that made us work out and become fit for our environment.
  - Consider how easy it is to find the energy to lift a car if a crying child is under it, or to run for your life if you see a wild animal crossing the street.
  - Compare this to the heaviness of the obligation to visit the gym at the planned 6 P.M. and be bullied there by some personal trainer—unless of course you are under the imperative to look like a bodyguard.

- ***There exist the kind of people for whom life is some kind of project. After talking to them, you stop feeling good for a few hours; life starts tasting like food cooked without salt.***
  - I, a thrill-seeking human, have a bullshit detector that seems to match my boredom detector, as if we were equipped with a naturalistic filter, dullness-aversion.
  - *Ancestral life had no homework, no boss, no civil servants, no academic grades, no conversation with the dean, no consultant with an MBA, no table of procedure, no application form, no trip to New Jersey, no grammatical stickler, no conversation with someone boring you: all life was random stimuli and nothing, good or bad, ever felt like work. Dangerous, yes, but boring, never.*
- Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury.

## CHAPTER 4 What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger

- Antifragility for one is fragility for someone else—Where we introduce the idea that we think too much, do very little—Fail for others to succeed—One day you may get a thank-you note.

### ANTIFRAGILITY BY LAYERS

- In a system, the sacrifices of some units—fragile units, that is, or people—are often necessary for the well-being of other units or the whole.
- ***The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that's what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate.***

- Restaurants are fragile; they compete with each other, but the collective of local restaurants is antifragile for that very reason.
  - Had restaurants been individually robust, hence immortal, the overall business would be either stagnant or weak, and would deliver nothing better than cafeteria food—and I mean Soviet-style cafeteria food.
  - Further, it would be marred with systemic shortages, with, once in a while, a complete crisis and government bailout.
  - All that quality, stability, and reliability are owed to the fragility of the restaurant itself.

- ***So some parts on the inside of a system may be required to be fragile in order to make the system antifragile as a result. Or the organism itself might be fragile, but the information encoded in the genes reproducing it will be antifragile.***

### Evolution and Unpredictability

- In fact, the most interesting aspect of evolution is that it only works because of its antifragility; it is in love with stressors, randomness, uncertainty, and disorder—while individual organisms are relatively fragile, the gene pool takes advantage of shocks to enhance its fitness.
- Everything alive or organic in nature has a finite life and dies eventually—even Methuselah lived less than a thousand years. But it usually dies after reproducing offspring with a genetic code in one way or another different from that of the parents, with their information modified.
- Nature prefers to let the game continue at the informational level, the genetic code. So organisms need to die for nature to be antifragile—nature is opportunistic, ruthless, and selfish.

- An immortal organism needs to be fit for all possible random events. It needs to be pre-adapted for everything.
- These organisms need to predict the future *perfectly*.
- If nature ran the economy, it would not continuously bail out its living members to make them live forever.
- If one looks at history as a complex system similar to nature, then, like nature, it won't let a single empire dominate the planet forever.
- Systems subjected to randomness—and unpredictability—build a mechanism beyond the robust to opportunistically reinvent themselves each generation, with a continuous change of population and species.
- Evolution benefits from randomness so that there's a chance to live even with unforeseen events. Up to some limit, because it cannot survive a planetary calamity.
- Ex: antibiotics, the harder you try to harm bacteria, the stronger the survivors will be.

### Organisms Are Populations and Populations Are Organisms

- A strengthening mechanism for the species comes at the expense of some organisms; in turn the organism strengthens at the expense of some cells, all the way down and all the way up as well.
- Depriving yourself of food means the bad proteins are broken down first and are recycled by your own body (autophagy).

### THANK YOU, ERRORS

- Now we get into errors and how the errors of some people carry benefits for others.
- When you are fragile, you depend on things following the exact planned course, with as little deviation as possible—for deviations are more harmful than helpful.
- If every trial provides you with information about what does not work, you start zooming in on a solution—so every attempt becomes more valuable, more like an expense than an error. And of course you make discoveries along the way.

### Learning from the Mistakes of Others

- So it is often the mistakes of others that benefit the rest of us—and, sadly, not them.
  - We saw that stressors are information, in the right context.
  - For the antifragile, harm from errors should be less than the benefits.
  - Had the Titanic not had that famous accident, as fatal as it was, we would have kept building larger and larger ocean liners and the next disaster would have been even more tragic. So the people who perished were sacrificed for the greater good; they unarguably saved more lives than were lost.
- Good systems such as airlines are set up to have small errors, independent from each other—or, in effect, negatively correlated to each other, since mistakes lower the odds of future mistakes.
- ***If every plane crash makes the next one less likely, every bank crash makes the next one more likely. We need to eliminate the second type of error—the one that produces contagion—in our construction of an ideal socioeconomic system.***

### How to Become Mother Teresa

- ***You may never know what type of person someone is unless they are given opportunities to violate moral or ethical codes.***
- ***A loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn't introspect, doesn't exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on.***
- These types often consider themselves the "victims" of some large plot, a bad boss, or bad weather.
- ***He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once. And someone who has made plenty of errors—though never the same error more than once—is more reliable than someone who has never made any.***

### WHY THE AGGREGATE HATES THE INDIVIDUAL

- For the economy to be antifragile and undergo what is called evolution, every single individual business must necessarily be fragile, exposed to breaking—evolution needs organisms (or their genes) to die when supplanted by others, in order to achieve improvement, or to avoid reproduction when they are not as fit as someone else.
- *Accordingly, the antifragility of the higher level may require the fragility—and sacrifice—of the lower one. Every time you use a coffeemaker for your morning cappuccino, you are benefiting from the fragility of the coffeemaking entrepreneur who failed. He failed in order to help put the superior merchandise on your kitchen counter.*
- While sacrifice as a modus is obvious in the case of ant colonies, I am certain that individual businessmen are not overly interested in hara-kiri for the greater good of the economy; they are therefore necessarily concerned in seeking antifragility or at least some level of robustness for themselves.
  - It is painful to think about ruthlessness as an engine of improvement.
  - People go to business school to learn how to do well while ensuring their survival—but what the economy, as a collective, wants them to do is to not survive, rather to take a lot, a lot of imprudent risks themselves and be blinded by the odds.
  - Their respective industries improve from failure to failure.
- We saw that the restaurant business is wonderfully efficient precisely because restaurants, being vulnerable, go bankrupt every minute, and entrepreneurs ignore such a possibility, as they think that they will beat the odds.
- ***Now, by disrupting the model, as we will see, with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other business. This is the opposite of healthy risk-taking; it is transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit.***
  - People have difficulty realizing that the solution is building a system in which nobody's fall can drag others down—for continuous failures work to preserve the system.
  - Paradoxically, many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established.

## WHAT DOES NOT KILL ME KILLS OTHERS

- Nietzsche's famous expression "what does not kill me makes me stronger" can be easily misinterpreted as meaning Mithridatization or hormesis.
- It may be one of these two phenomena, very possible, but it could as well mean "what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone."
- Soviet concentration camps: Someone paid a price for the system to improve.

### Me and Us

- This visible tension between individual and collective interests is new in history: in the past it was dealt with by the near irrelevance of individuals.
- Sacrifice for the sake of the group is behind the notion of heroism: it is good for the tribe, bad for those who perish under the fever of war.
- This instinct for heroism and the fading of individual interests in favor of the communal has become aberrant with suicide bombers.
- *It is a fallacy that suicide bombers are driven by the promise of a reward of some Islamic paradise with virgins and other entertainment, for, as the anthropologist Scott Atran has pointed out, the first suicide bombers in the Levant were revolutionaries of Greek Orthodox background—my tribe—not Islamists.*
- There is something like a switch in us that kills the individual in favor of the collective when people engage in communal dances, mass riots, or war. Your mood is now that of the herd. You are part of what Elias Canetti calls the rhythmic and throbbing crowd. You can also feel a different variety of crowd experience during your next street riot, when fear of authorities vanishes completely under group fever.

- Some of the ideas about fitness and selection here are not very comfortable to this author, which makes the writing of some sections rather painful—I detest the ruthlessness of selection, the inexorable disloyalty of Mother Nature.
  - I detest the notion of improvement thanks to harm to others.
  - As a humanist, I stand against the antifragility of systems at the expense of individuals, for if you follow the reasoning, this makes us humans individually irrelevant.
  - The unit in traditional cultures is the collective; and it could be perceived to be harmed by the behavior of an individual—ex: family honor.
- ***An economy cannot survive without breaking individual eggs; protection is harmful, and constraining the forces of evolution to benefit individuals does not seem required. But we can shield individuals from starvation, provide some social protection. And give them respect.***

### National Entrepreneur Day

- Entrepreneurship is a risky and heroic activity, necessary for growth or even the mere survival of the economy.
  - It is also necessarily collective on epistemological grounds—to facilitate the development of expertise.
  - Someone who did not find something is providing others with knowledge, the best knowledge, that of absence (what does not work)—yet he gets little or no credit for it.
  - He is a central part of the process with incentives going to others and, what is worse, gets no respect.5
- In order to progress, modern society should be treating ruined entrepreneurs in the same way we honor dead soldiers, perhaps not with as much honor, but using exactly the same logic (the entrepreneur is still alive, though perhaps morally broken and socially stigmatized).
  - For there is no such thing as a failed soldier, dead or alive (unless he acted in a cowardly manner)—likewise, there is no such thing as a failed entrepreneur or failed scientific researcher.
  - Compare entrepreneurs to the beancounting managers of companies who climb the ladder of hierarchy with hardly ever any real downside. Their cohort is rarely at risk.

- ***My dream—the solution—is that we would have a National Entrepreneur Day, with the following message: Most of you will fail, disrespected, impoverished, but we are grateful for the risks you are taking and the sacrifices you are making for the sake of the economic growth of the planet and pulling others out of poverty. You are at the source of our antifragility. Our nation thanks you.***

## BOOK II Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility

## CHAPTER 5 The Souk and the Office Building

- ***This is the central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that it is a bad thing—and that eliminating randomness is done by eliminating randomness.***
- Thanks to variability, these artisanal careers harbor a bit of antifragility: small variations make them adapt and change continuously by learning from the environment and being, sort of, continuously under pressure to be fit.
  - Remember that stressors are information; these careers face a continuous supply of these stressors that make them adjust opportunistically.
- Man-made smoothing of randomness produces the equivalent of John's income: smooth, steady, but fragile.
  - Such income is more vulnerable to large shocks that can make it go to zero.
  - Natural randomness presents itself more like George's income: smaller role for very large shocks, but daily variability. Further, such variability helps improve the system (hence the antifragility).
  - A week with declining earnings for a taxi driver or a prostitute provides information concerning the environment and intimates the need to find a new part of town where clients hang around; a month or so without earnings drives them to revise their skills.

### BOTTOM-UP VARIATIONS

- There is another issue with the abstract state, a psychological one. We humans scorn what is not concrete.
  - We are more easily swayed by a crying baby than by thousands of people dying elsewhere that do not make it to our living room through the TV set. The one case is a tragedy, the other a statistic.
  - Our emotional energy is blind to probability. The media make things worse as they play on our infatuation with anecdotes, our thirst for the sensational, and they cause a great deal of unfairness that way.
  - At the present time, one person is dying of diabetes every seven seconds, but the news can only talk about victims of hurricanes with houses flying in the air.

- ***The problem is that by creating bureaucracies, we put civil servants in a position to make decisions based on abstract and theoretical matters, with the illusion that they will be making them in a rational, accountable way.***
  - Also consider that lobbyists—this annoying race of lobbyists—cannot exist in a municipality or small region. The Europeans, thanks to the centralization of (some) power with the European Commission in Brussels, are quickly discovering the existence of these mutants coming to manipulate democracy for the sake of some large corporation.
  - By influencing one single decision or regulation in Brussels, a single lobbyist gets a large bang. It is a much larger payoff (at low cost) than with municipalities, which would require armies of lobbyists trying to convince people while embedded in their communities.
- ***Switzerland: it is perhaps the most successful country in history, yet it has traditionally had a very low level of university education compared to the rest of the rich nations. Its system, even in banking during my days, was based on apprenticeship models, nearly vocational rather than the theoretical ones. In other words, on techne (crafts and know how), not episteme (book knowledge, know what).***

### AWAY FROM EXTREMISTAN

- Mediocirstan: plenty of variations that might be scary, but cancel out in the long term.
- Extremistan: mostly stable but has errors with large consequences.
- A turkey is fed for a thousand days by a butcher; every day confirms to its staff of analysts that butchers love turkeys "with increased statistical confidence."
  - The butcher will keep feeding the turkey until a few days before Thanksgiving.
  - Then comes that day when it is really not a very good idea to be a turkey. So with the butcher surprising it, the turkey will have a revision of belief—right when its confidence in the statement that the butcher loves turkeys is maximal and "it is very quiet" and soothingly predictable in the life of the turkey.
- ***We can also see from the turkey story the mother of all harmful mistakes: mistaking absence of evidence (of harm) for evidence of absence, a mistake that we will see tends to prevail in intellectual circles and one that is grounded in the social sciences.***

- Economic life, too, seems to prefer war to prison.
- Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, citing him: "It seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger [and] its citizens infused with virtues.… A little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn't peace, but freedom."

## CHAPTER 6 Tell Them I Love (Some) Randomness

- When a currency never varies, a slight, very slight move makes people believe that the world is ending. Injecting some confusion stabilizes the system.
- Indeed, confusing people a little bit is beneficial—it is good for you and good for them.
- For an application of the point in daily life, imagine someone extremely punctual and predictable who comes home at exactly six o'clock every day for fifteen years.  The fellow will cause his family anxiety if he is barely a few minutes late. Someone with a slightly more volatile—hence unpredictable—schedule, with, say, a half-hour variation, won't do so.

### HUNGRY DONKEYS

- When some systems are stuck in a dangerous impasse, randomness and only randomness can unlock them and set them free. You can see here that absence of randomness equals guaranteed death.
- The idea of injecting random noise into a system to improve its functioning has been applied across fields.
- In a computer simulation, Alessandro Pluchino and his colleagues showed how adding a certain number of randomly selected politicians to the process can improve the functioning of the parliamentary system.
- Or sometimes the system benefits from a different type of stressors. For Voltaire, the best form of government was the one tempered with political assassination.
- Regicide is sort of the equivalent of tapping on the barometer to make it work better. That, too, creates some often-needed reshuffling, and one that would never have been done voluntarily.
- ***Unfortunately, you cannot randomize a political party out of existence. What is plaguing us in the United States is not the two-party system, but being stuck with the same two parties. Parties don't have organic built-in expiration dates.***

- One of the methods, called sortes virgilianae (fate as decided by the epic poet Virgil), involved opening Virgil's Aeneid at random and interpreting the line that presented itself as direction for the course of action. You should use such method for every sticky business decision. I will repeat until I get hoarse: the ancients evolved hidden and sophisticated ways and tricks to exploit randomness.
- Author picks random dishes in restaurants, with the peace of mind that someone else made the decision for him.

### THAT TIME BOMB CALLED STABILITY

- Conflicts strengthen countries?
- We know that pruning trees strengthens them.
- Extended, constrained, non-natural peace led toe WWI after a century of relative peace in Europe.
- We have vaccination (injecting ourselves with a bit of harm to build immunity) every year but don't do the same in political and economic domains.

### What to Tell the Foreign Policy Makers

- With artificially suppressed volatility, the system can become fragile (while not showing any visible risks.)
  - Volatility is information.
  - Although the stated intention of political leaders and economic policy makers is to stabilize the system by inhibiting fluctuations, the result tends to be the opposite.
  - These artificially constrained systems become prone to Black Swans.
  - Ex: Egypt was artificially stable by the US.
  - Ex: Saudi Arabia being a country that is enforced by a superpower at the expense of every single possible moral and ethical metric. How long would such a system exist?
  - Ex: Iran's resentment towards the US is because the US installed a monarch who pillaged the place but gave the US "stability" to access the Persian Gulf -> leads to theocracy.

### WHAT DO WE CALL HERE MODERNITY?

- Modernity: removing humans from the randomness-laden ecology. "Society can be understood", bell curve, "efficiency".
- Ex: lion in the zoo vs in the wild.
- ***We are moving into a phase of modernity marked by the lobbyist, the very, very limited liability corporation, the MBA, sucker problems, secularization (or rather reinvention of new sacred values like flags to replace altars), the tax man, fear of the boss, spending the weekend in interesting places and the workweek in a putatively less interesting one, the separation of "work" and "leisure" (though the two would look identical to someone from a wiser era), the retirement plan, argumentative intellectuals who would disagree with this definition of modernity, literal thinking, inductive inference, philosophy of science, the invention of social science, smooth surfaces, and egocentric architects. Violence is transferred from individuals to states. So is financial indiscipline. At the center of all this is the denial of antifragility.***
- Modernity widened the difference between the sensational and the relevant—in a natural environment the sensational is, well, sensational for a reason; today we depend on the press for such essentially human things as gossip and anecdotes and we care about the private lives of people in very remote places.
- Core of modernity:
  - Naive interventionism, with the costs associated with fixing things that should just be left alone.
  - Replacing God/gods with the unconditional belief in the idea of scientific prediction regardless of the domain.

## CHAPTER 7 Naive Intervention

### INTERVENTION AND IATROGENICS

- Tonsillectomy: chance to kill the child. Net loss caused by the healer.
- Possible that George Washington was killed by the doctors who did bloodletting.
- The evidence of increase in death rates is about as strong as they come, since all the victims were now gathered in one place: people were dying in these institutions who would have survived outside them.
- Medical error kills between 3x and 10x as many people as car accidents in the US.
- It is easy to assess iatrogenics when the surgeon amputates the wrong leg or operates on the wrong kidney, or when the patient dies of a drug reaction.
- But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.
- Iatrogenics:
  - Socioeconomic life.
  - The human body.
  - Errors in physics get smaller from theory to theory—so saying "Newton was wrong" is attention grabbing, good for lurid science journalism, but ultimately mendacious; it would be far more honest to say "Newton's theory is imprecise in some specific cases."
  - Predictions made by Newtonian mechanics are of astonishing precision except for items traveling close to the speed of light, something you don't expect to do on your next vacation.
- Physics vs social science:
  - Physics theories converge; social science theories diverge.

### Not Doing Nothing

-0 A main source of the economic crisis that started in 2007 lies in the iatrogenics of the attempt by Überfragilista Alan Greenspan—certainly the top economic iatrogenist of all time—to iron out the "boom-bust cycle" which caused risks to go hide under the carpet and accumulate there until they blew up the economy.
- Greenspan was actually a libertarian lol.
- *Just as a little bit of fire here and there gets rid of the flammable material in a forest, a little bit of harm here and there in an economy weeds out the vulnerable firms early enough to allow them to "fail early" (so they can start again) and minimize the long-term damage to the system.*
- If you supply a typical copy editor with a text, he will propose a certain number of edits, say about five changes per page.
  - Now accept his "corrections" and give this text to another copy editor who tends to have the same average rate of intervention (editors vary in interventionism), and you will see that he will suggest an equivalent number of edits, sometimes reversing changes made by the previous editor. Find a third editor, same.

### Non-Naive Interventionism

- ***The argument is not against the notion of intervention. We just need to avoid being blind to the natural antifragility of systems, their ability to take care of themselves, and fight our tendency to harm and fragilize them by not giving them a chance to do so.***
- Ex: Drachten, a town in the Netherlands: All street signs were removed, leading to an increase in safety.
- But you can't remove signs in a highway, because there is a different dynamic there.
- Problem with two-party system:
  - Democrats: hyper-intervention, unconditional regulation, large government.
  - Republicans: large corporations, unconditional deregulation, and militarism.
- ***To me it is mostly about having a systematic protocol to determine when to intervene and when to leave systems alone.***

### IN PRAISE OF PROCRASTINATION—THE FABIAN KIND

- ***There is an element of deceit associated with interventionism, accelerating in a professionalized society. It's much easier to sell "Look what I did for you" than "Look what I avoided for you."***
- Harder to reward people for not doing things (not doing a bad surgery, or not doing something which prevents a calamity from taking place).
- A very intelligent group of revolutionary fellows in the United Kingdom created a political movement called the Fabian Society, named after the Cunctator, based on opportunistically delaying the revolution. The society included George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, Ramsay MacDonald, and even Bertrand Russell for a moment.
- ***In retrospect, it turned out to be a very effective strategy, not so much as a way to achieve their objectives, but rather to accommodate the fact that these objectives are moving targets. Procrastination turned out to be a way to let events take their course and give the activists the chance to change their minds before committing to irreversible policies. And of course members did change their minds after seeing the failures and horrors of Stalinism and similar regimes.***
- There is a Latin expression festina lente, "make haste slowly." The Romans were not the only ancients to respect the act of voluntary omission. The Chinese thinker Lao Tzu coined the doctrine of wu-wei, "passive achievement."
- Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility; it results from some ecological or naturalistic wisdom, and is not always bad—at an existential level, it is my body rebelling against its entrapment.
- ***Psychologists and economists who study "irrationality" do not realize that humans may have an instinct to procrastinate only when no life is in danger. I do not procrastinate when I see a lion entering my bedroom or fire in my neighbor's library. I do not procrastinate after a severe injury. I do so with unnatural duties and procedures. I once procrastinated and kept delaying a spinal cord operation as a response to a back injury—and was completely cured of the back problem after a hiking vacation in the Alps, followed by weight-lifting sessions.***
- *Actually I select the writing of the passages of this book by means of procrastination. If I defer writing a section, it must be eliminated. This is simple ethics: Why should I try to fool people by writing about a subject for which I feel no natural drive?*
- In fact we humans are very bad at filtering information, particularly short-term information, and procrastination can be a way for us to filter better, to resist the consequences of jumping on information, as we discuss next.

## NEUROTICISM IN INDUSTRIAL PROPORTIONS

- Ex: think of a neurotic/paranoid person, compared to an imperturbable one.
- ***The supply of information to which we are exposed thanks to modernity is transforming humans from the equable second fellow into the neurotic first one. For the purpose of our discussion, the second fellow only reacts to real information, the first largely to noise.***
- If you want to accelerate someone's death, give him a personal doctor. This may be the only possible way to murder someone while staying squarely within the law.
  - ***Someone with a personal doctor on staff should be particularly vulnerable to naive interventionism, hence iatrogenics; doctors need to justify their salaries and prove to themselves that they have a modicum of work ethic, something that "doing nothing" doesn't satisfy.***
  - Did you ever wonder why heads of state and very rich people with access to all this medical care die just as easily as regular persons? Well, it looks like this is because of overmedication and excessive medical care.
- Newspapers and too much data.
- ***In medicine, we are discovering the healing powers of fasting, as the avoidance of the hormonal rushes that come with the ingestion of food. Same with data/information: too much information is harmful.***
- ***We are not made to understand the point, so we overreact emotionally to noise. The best solution is to only look at very large changes in data or conditions, never at small ones.***

### Media-Driven Neuroticism

- ***There is so much noise coming from the media's glorification of the anecdote. Thanks to this, we are living more and more in virtual reality, separated from the real world, a little bit more every day while realizing it less and less. Consider that every day, 6,200 persons die in the United States, many of preventable causes. But the media only report the most anecdotal and sensational cases (hurricanes, freak accidents, small plane crashes), giving us a more and more distorted map of real risks. In an ancestral environment, the anecdote, the "interesting," is information; today, no longer. Likewise, by presenting us with explanations and theories, the media induce an illusion of understanding the world.***
- *The best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information, as naturalistically as possible. This is hard to accept in the age of the Internet. It has been very hard for me to explain that the more data you get, the less you know what's going on, and the more iatrogenics you will cause.*

### THE STATE CAN HELP—WHEN INCOMPETENT

- China famine: more severe in areas with higher food production in the period before the famine began, meaning that it was government policy of food distribution that was behind much of the problem, owing to the inflexibility in the procurement system.
- France: as a country managed in a top-down manner by an oversized state, could fare so well in so many fields.
  - Indeed the current culture is ultra-interventionist, sort of "if it ain't broke, fix it."
  - France in 1863 did not speak French (only one in five persons could), but rather a variety of languages and dialects.
  - The lack of linguistic integration—like the variety in cheese —expresses the difficulties in centralizing the country.
  - There was nothing ethnic or linguistic to bind the place—it was just the property of a king and a weak aristocracy.
  - Tax collection was a dangerous profession, requiring tenacity and sagacity.
  - Paris itself was barely controlled by France—no more than the Rio slums called favelas are currently ruled by the Brazilian central state.
  - Louis XIV, the Sun King, had moved the government to Versailles to escape the Parisian crowd.
  - Effectively France was still Paris and "the desert," as Paris didn't care much about the rest of France.
  - The country was only centralized after long programs and "Five Year Plans" of roads, rail systems, public schools, and the spread of television—a Napoleonic dream of integration that, begun by De Gaulle after the war, was only completed during the reign of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in the late 1970s, at which point the decentralization started taking place.

### Sweden and the Large State

- Sweden/Nordics: government represents a large portion of the total economy.
  - How could we have the happiest nation in the world, Denmark, and a monstrously large state?
  - It was almost the same story as in Switzerland. The state exists as a tax collector, but the money is spent in the communes themselves, directed by the communes—for, say, skills training locally determined as deemed necessary by the community themselves, to respond to private demand for workers.
  - The economic elites have more freedom than in most other democracies—this is far from the statism one can assume from the outside.
  - Further, illustrating a case of gaining from disorder, Sweden and other Nordic countries experienced a severe recession at the end of the cold war, around 1990, to which they responded admirably with a policy of fiscal toughness, thus effectively shielding them from the severe financial crisis that took place about two decades later.

## CHAPTER 8 Prediction as a Child of Modernity

- Forecasting is not neutral. Forecasting can be downright injurious to risk-takers—no different from giving people snake oil medicine in place of cancer treatment, or bleeding, as in the story of George Washington.
  - There are ample empirical findings to the effect that providing someone with a random numerical forecast increases his risk taking, even if the person knows the projections are random.
- What makes life simple is that the robust and antifragile don't have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile—and they do not need forecasting.
- To see how redundancy is a nonpredictive, or rather a less predictive, mode of action, let us use the argument of Chapter 2: if you have extra cash in the bank (in addition to stockpiles of tradable goods such as cans of Spam and hummus and gold bars in the basement), you don't need to know with precision which event will cause potential difficulties.

### Plus or Minus Bad Teeth

- The mission what to do to minimize harm/maximize gain from forecasting errors/have things that don't fall apart when we make a mistake.
- We don't want to change the world for now; we should first make things more robust to defects/forecast errors.
- If history is in the business of making it out of lemons, antifragility is necessarily how things move forward under time.
- Instead of blaming the inability to see an event coming, why not blame the fact that we made something that is fragile to these type of events? You can excuse not seeing a tsunami, but building something fragile is not.
- We can't rely on rational elimination of greed and other human defects that fragilize society. Why not make things greed-proof, and hopefully make society benefit from the greed and other perceived defects of the human race.
- Ex: Fukushima, instead of predicting failure, they just focus on what happens if things are to fail. So smaller reactors and embedding them deep enough in the ground such that a failure would not affect us even if it happens.

### The Idea of Becoming a Non-Turkey

- Because of modernity, the share of Extremistan is increasing.
  - Winner-take-all effects are worsening: success for an author, a company, an idea, a musician, an athlete is planetary, or nothing.
  - These worsen predictability since almost everything in socioeconomic life now is dominated by Black Swans.
  - Our sophistication continuously puts us ahead of ourselves, creating things we are less and less capable of understanding.

### No More Black Swans

- ***From my experiences of the Lebanese war and a couple of storms with power outages in Westchester County, New York, I suggest stocking up on novels, as we tend to underestimate the boredom of these long hours waiting for the trouble to dissipate. And books, being robust, are immune to power outages.***

## BOOK III A Nonpredictive View of the World

### CHAPTER 9 Fat Tony and the Fragilistas

#### The Antifragility of Libraries

- Nero: ascetic, conducts activities by daylight, reads books, settles for a sedate life, post-adventure. Part of the aesthetic ailment that brings revulsion/phobia towards: people wearing flip-flops, TV, bankers, politicians, rich people who take cruises.
- Fat Tony: allergic to empty suits, and he can smell fragility.
- ***Alas, men of leisure become slaves to inner feelings of dissatisfaction and interests over which they have little control. The freer Nero's time, the more compelled he felt to compensate for lost time in filling gaps in his natural interests, things that he wanted to know a bit deeper. And, as he discovered, the worst thing one can do to feel one knows things a bit deeper is to try to go into them a bit deeper. The sea gets deeper as you go further into it, according to a Venetian proverb.***
- ***Curiosity is antifragile, like an addiction, and is magnified by attempts to satisfy it—books have a secret mission and ability to multiply, as everyone who has wall-to-wall bookshelves knows well. Nero lived, at the time of writing, among fifteen thousand books, with the stress of how to discard the empty boxes and wrapping material after the arrival of his daily shipment from the bookstore. One subject Nero read for pleasure, rather than the strange duty-to-read-to-become-more-learned, was medical texts, for which he had a natural curiosity. The curiosity came from having had two brushes with death, the first from a cancer and the second from a helicopter crash that alerted him to both the fragility of technology and the self-healing powers of the human body. So he spent a bit of his time reading textbooks (not papers—textbooks) in medicine, or professional texts.***
- Nero enjoyed taking long walks in old cities, without a map, and decided on his next destination only after he had spent time in the first one.

### ON SUCKERS AND NONSUCKERS

- Fat Tony: thinks nerds/admins/bankers were suckers. He derived his income from an activity while leading a life of leisure.
- Nero's interests were similar to Tony's, except dressed up in intellectual traditions. To Nero, a system built on illusions of understanding probability is bound to collapse.
- By betting against fragility, they were antifragile.
- ***Excess wealth, if you don't need it, is a heavy burden. Nothing was more hideous in his eyes than excessive refinement—in clothes, food, lifestyle, manners—and wealth was nonlinear. Beyond some level it forces people into endless complications of their lives, creating worries about whether the housekeeper in one of the country houses is scamming them while doing a poor job and similar headaches that multiply with money.***
- *There is another dimension to the need to focus on actions and avoid words: the health-eroding dependence on external recognition. People are cruel and unfair in the way they confer recognition, so it is best to stay out of that game. Stay robust to how others treat you.*
- *Nero learned that no matter how satisfied they could be with their work, these hotshots-who-depended-on-words were deprived of Tony's serenity; they remained fragile to the emotional toll from the compliments they did not get, the ones others got, and from what someone of lower intellect stole from them.*
- ***A man is honorable in proportion to the personal risks he takes for his opinion—in other words, the amount of downside he is exposed to. To sum him up, Nero believed in erudition, aesthetics, and risk taking—little else.***
- As to the funds, to avoid the charity trap, Nero followed Fat Tony's rule of systematically making donations, but not to those who directly asked for gifts. And he never, never gave a penny to any charitable organization, with the possible exception of those in which not a single person earned a salary.

### What the Nonpredictor Can Predict

- Fat Tony did not believe in predictions. But he made big bucks predicting that some people—the predictors—would go bust.
- ***You can't predict in general, but you can predict that those who rely on predictions are taking more risks, will have some trouble, perhaps even go bust. Why? Someone who predicts will be fragile to prediction errors. An overconfident pilot will eventually crash the plane. And numerical prediction leads people to take more risks.***
- Fat Tony is antifragile because he takes a mirror image of his fragile prey.
- Fat Tony's model is quite simple. He identifies fragilities, makes a bet on the collapse of the fragile unit, lectures Nero and trades insults with him about sociocultural matters, reacting to Nero's jabs at New Jersey life, collects big after the collapse. Then he has lunch.

## CHAPTER 10 Seneca's Upside and Downside

### Is This Really Serious?

- Seneca/Stoicism: how to take a trip, how to handle yourself when committing suicide, how to handle adversity, poverty, and wealth.
- Wisdom in decision making is vastly more important than knowledge.
- To be a successful philosopher king, it is much better to start as a king than a philosopher.
- Decision theory peeps: they gravitate to the most complicated but most inapplicable problems, calling the process "doing science."
  - People who talk about risk but do not actually encounter risk.
- Seneca: literally survived a shipwreck in which other family members perished.
  - Killed himself eventually.

### Less Downside from Life

- Seneca = fucking rich.
- Traditional understanding of Stoicism:
  - Indifference to fate.
  - Continuously degrading the value of earthly possessions.
  - "Nihil perditi": I lost nothing. Seneca
  - On luxury: "He is in debt whether he borrowed from another person or from fortune."
- ***Stoicism, seen this way, becomes pure robustness—for the attainment of a state of immunity from one's external circumstances, good or bad, and an absence of fragility to decisions made by fate, is robustness. Random events won't affect us either way (we are too strong to lose, and not greedy to enjoy the upside), so we stay in the middle column of the Triad.***
- What we learn from reading Seneca directly, rather than through the commentators, is a different story. Seneca's version of that Stoicism is antifragility from fate. No downside from luck, plenty of upside.
- Stoicism was not supposed to be about gains and benefits, so on paper it was not at the level of antifragility, just about a sense of control over one's fate and the reduction of psychological fragility. If wealth is a burden, what's the point of having it?

### Stoicism's Emotional Robustification

- When you become successful, you have more to lose than to gain, and you become fragile.
  - A rich person becomes trapped by belongings that take control of him.
  - If the things you would gain would not benefit you, and you would feel harm from the loss of the same amount, then there is an asymmetry. You are fragile.
- Seneca's method to counter fragility: go through mental exercises to write off possessions, so when losses occurred, he would not feel the sting.
- He started his journeys with almost the same belongings that he would have if he were shipwrecked, which included a blanket to sleep on the ground.
- On employment: author has always hated the associated dependence on someone else's arbitrary opinion, especially when the things done in a large corporation violates his sense of ethics.
- On trading: what would happen if the worst trades happened today?
- The method of mentally adjusting "to the worst" had advantages way beyond the therapeutic, as it made my take a certain class of risks for which the worst case is clear and unambiguous, with limited and known downside.
- Good discipline to have this mental write-off thing.
- ***An intelligent life is all about such emotional positioning to eliminate the sting of harm, which as we saw is done by mentally writing off belongings so one does not feel any pain from losses. The volatility of the world no longer affects you negatively.***

### The Domestication of Emotions

- ***Stoicism is about the domestication, not necessarily the elimination, of emotions. My idea of the modern Stoic sage is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.***
- Seneca: wait a day before beating up a servant who committed a violation.
- ***Seneca also provides us a catalogue of social deeds: invest in good actions. Things can be taken away from us—not good deeds and acts of virtue.***
- Keep the wealth. Keep the good and ditch the bad parts of it.

### The Foundational Asymmetry

- ***Let us put together Seneca's asymmetry in a single rule. The concept I used earlier is more to lose from adversity. If you have more to lose than to benefit from events of fate, there is an asymmetry, and not a good one.***
- ***Antifragility implies more to gain than to lose, equals more upside than downside, equals (favorable) asymmetry.***
- A Stoic is a Buddhist with attitude, one who says "fuck you" to fate.

## CHAPTER 11 Never Marry the Rock Star

### ON THE IRREVERSIBILITY OF BROKEN PACKAGES

- Path dependence: the difference between eating dessert first vs last.
- Ex: speed/growth without accounting for fragility, you can drive at a high speed but you won't get anywhere if there's traffic.
- If something is fragile, its risk of breaking makes anything you do to improve it or make it efficient inconsequential.
- Ex: You can increase GDP by borrowing money.

### SENECA'S BARBELL

- Barbell: a combination of both extremes kept separate, with avoidance of the middle.
- Playing it safe and taking a lot of small risks in others.
- Extreme risk aversion/extreme risk loving.
- Ex: hanging out with janitors and scholars, rarely with middlebrows.

### The Accountant and the Rock Star

- Females tend to marry the "someone stable who can provide", but once in a while, they cheat with the aggressive alpha.
  - This cheating occurs in periods with high chances of pregnancy.
  - They want stable life and good genes.
- People need to experience some stress to wake them up a bit.
- *"Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself."*

### Away from the Golden Middle

- European writers: tendency to look for the job, civil servant (few intellectual demands, high job security, ends when you go home).
  - American writers: tend to become members of the media, academics. They write according to someone else's standards.
  - Kafka: worked in an insurance company. Spinoza: lens maker. Taleb: trader (did writing on his own time and his own terms). After his office job, he can do whatever he wanted.
- Pure action, then pure reflection.
- Seneca: had a very active, adventurous life, followed by a philosophical withdrawal to write and meditate.
- Work intensely, then do nothing, until you recover.
- ***The most prolific writers of the 20th century wrote only sixty days a year.***

### The Domestication of Uncertainty

- We will see many barbells in the rest of this book that share exactly the same asymmetry and somehow, when it comes to risk, produce the same type of protection and help in the harnessing of antifragility. They all look remarkably similar.
- Taleb's rules:
  - No smoking.
  - No sugar.
  - No motorcycles.
  - No bicycles in town.
  - No getting in a plane not flown by a professional pilot.
  - Everything else: GO.
- Old UK/empire: adventurers + aristocracy + tinkerers at home.
- Taleb's writing approach: either essays that can be grasped by anyone or technical papers.
- Do crazy things once in a while, and stay rational in larger decisions. Either trashy shit or sophisticated works. Talk to the best in your field. If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him.
- ***The mitigation of fragility: clip downside risks while keep the benefits of potential gains.***
- Barbell = the domestication of uncertainty.

## BOOK IV Optionality, Technology, and the Intelligence of Antifragility

### DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING?

The Teleological Fallacy

- "Agents are supposed to know where they are going."
- Fallacy: you know where you are going, you knew were going in the past, and that others have succeeded in the past by knowing where they were going.
- Modify your targets while you acquire information.
- The opposite of opportunism in human relations is loyalty.
- Steve Jobs: he distrusted market research and focus groups and followed his own imagination.
- America: no shame in failing, starting again, and repeating failure. Compare to Japan.

## CHAPTER 12 Thales' Sweet Grapes

- Thales of Miletus: philosopher who figured out a way to get fuck you money (a sum large enough to get the advantage of wealth (independence/the ability to occupy your mind with things that interest you), but not its side effects.
- The worst side effect of wealth: having to socialize with certain types of people.

### OPTION AND ASYMMETRY

- The best thing about financial independence: freedom.
- You'll also get to know yourself (your real preferences) when you have options and choices.
- Do you actually not like the pursuit of money, or are you just rationalizing it?
- Thales: because he funded his own philosophy, he was being both independent and intellectually productive. No need for him to tell others where he was going, because he didn't know where he was heading, and thanks to his options (due to wealth), he didn't have to.
- Better if your supporters are enthusiastic and influential. Same for your work, ideas, politics, arts.
- Luxury goods: those businesses only care about the pool of funds available to the very rich. They need inequality.
- Male population: has more variety in intelligence, and their tails are why there are a lot of smart males and a lot of males in jails.
- ***No one at present dares to state the obvious: growth in society may not come from raising the average the Asian way, but from increasing the number of people in the "tails," that small, very small number of risk takers crazy enough to have ideas of their own, those endowed with that very rare ability called imagination, that rarer quality called courage, and who make things happen.***
- Aristotle made the mistake of thinking that knowledge about the event and making profits out of it are the same thing.
- If you have optionality, you don't have to be right that often, you just have to not do unintelligent things, and recognize favorable outocmes when they occur.
- *Jacob argued that even within the womb, nature knows how to select: about half of all embryos undergo a spontaneous abortion—easier to do so than design the perfect baby by blueprint. Nature simply keeps what it likes if it meets its standards or does a California-style "fail early"—it has an option and uses it.*

### The Rationality

- ***Option = asymmetry + rationality.***
- Evolution = rational.
- "Life is long gamma." (Life benefits from volatility and variability.)
- *Risk taking ain't gambling, and optionality ain't lottery tickets.*
- Historically, the largest generators of wealth in America have been real estate and technology.
- A benefit of being rich is that you can despise rich people without any sour grapes.
- *Optionality: getting the upper half of luck.*

## CHAPTER 13 Lecturing Birds on How to Fly

- Lol re: the gap between when the wheel was invented and when bags with wheels were invented.
- Tech is trivial only retrospectively, not prospectively. We humans lack imagination, to the point of not even knowing what tomorrow's important things look like.
- There's usually not many innovations, except for some visionaries.
- Antifragility (thanks to trial and error) supersedes intelligence. But you still need intelligence.
- Ex: 2 centuries between discovering germs and the acceptance of germs as the cause of disease.

### Search and How Errors Can Be Investments

- Because of optionality, trial and error isn't really that random, you should be rational about it.
- Ex: you don't look for your misplaced things in the same place twice.
- Knowledge: Things that we do and we do well.
- "Knowledge": the things you can grades for.
- Knowledge -> science -> technology -> practical applications -> economic growth.

### EPIPHENOMENA

- Epiphenomenon: you don't usually observe A without observing B with it, so you are likely to think that A causes B, or that B causes A.
- So does having short hair (as most boys do) cause gender?
- Greed is older than systemic fragility. We cannot change humans as easily as we can build greed-proof systems.
- Research: report facts that confirm the story, while not revealing facts that disprove it or don't apply to it. *Academia tells us what it did for us, and not what it did not.*

## CHAPTER 14 When Two Things Are Not the "Same Thing"

- University knowledge doesn't necessarily contribute to wealth. Dubai: Wealth came from oil.
- For an individual, education builds credentials. This helps in stabilizing family incomes.
- At the country level, this gets washed out.
- Not all countries with increased education got a leap in economics.
- In ancient times, learning was for learning's sake, to make someone a good person to talk to, not to increase the stock of gold.
- Ents are selected to be doers, and so we should not measure them in the talk department. Same with artisans.
- Bureaucrats become judged on the basis on looks and elegance.
- Evolution does not rely on narratives, but humans do.
- Fat Tony: He didn't know where Iraq was, but he knew that suckers existed. So he bet on the price of oil going down. He got rich from this because people hoarded too much.
- ***The green lumber fallacy: the situation in which one mistakes a source of visible knowledge — the greenness of lumber — for another, less visible from the outside, less tractable, less narratable.***
- Religious stories might have no value as narratives, but they may get you to do something convex and antifragile you otherwise would not do, like mitigate risks.
- Intellectuals tend to believe their own bullshit and take their ideas too literally, and that is vastly dangerous.
- ***Evolution is not a competition between ideas, but between humans and systems based on such ideas. An idea does not survive because it is better than the competition, but rather because the person who holds it has survived!***
- Classroom education comes from wealth, it doesn't necessarily lead to wealth.

## CHAPTER 15 History Written by the Losers

- To understand tech, you need accounts by non-historians, or people who watched the tech form.
- A child doesn't need to know aerodynamics in order to ride a bicycle.
- ***Trader formula: Traders trade → traders figure out techniques and products → academic economists find formulas and claim traders are using them → new traders believe academics → blowups (from theory-induced fragility).***
- *Practitioners don't write; they do. Birds fly and those who lecture them are the ones who write their story. So it is easy to see that history is truly written by losers with time on their hands and a protected academic position.*
- We don't put theories into practice, we create theories out of practice.
- On Euclid's geometry: the ancients developed an interest because they were using that already. Things that are implemented tend to want to be born from practice, not theory.
- On how old architectural things were built: not through math, but according to people doing experiments. (People didn't know how to divide then).
- The Romans built aqueducts without math (hard to compute with Roman numerals, hehe).
- Vitruvius's De Architectura: nothing about Euclid, but pure heuristics/rules.

### Is It Like Cooking?

- Cooking: lots of options. "As long as it tastes good."
- Physics: theories generate theories/need empirical validation.
- History of computers: due to combinatorics? Punch cards to needing an input (keyboard and monitor) to word processing, to microcomputers.
- Computer tech relies on science, but academic science did not serve in setting its direction.
- Knowledge formation, even when theoretical, takes time, some boredom, and the freedom that comes from having another occupation, therefore allowing one to escape the journalistic-style pressure of modern publish-and-perish academia to produce cosmetic knowledge.
- Innovation in the 19th/20th centuries: hobbyists and English priests with no worries, a big house, a reliable supply of tea, free time, and optionality. Most inventions were from English reverends back then.
- The Industrial Revolution came from "technologists building technology,", hobby science. The steam engine had a blueprint from the Greeks, but someone tried to make it.
- Things to make clothes: came from hobbyists, not scientific pursuit.
- Spending should be put in things that work.
- Venture capitalists: bet on ents, not ideas.

### THE CASE IN MEDICINE

- Private industry develops nine drugs out of ten.
- Some discovery is for the military (chemotherapy).
- Create an environment that can facilitate collaborations and you lay down the foundation for prosperity. Also, you can't centralize innovations.
- Historically, skepticism is skepticism of expert knowledge rather than skepticism about abstract entities like God.
- Corporations love strategic plan: they need to pay to figure out where they are going. No evidence that this works.
- Biotech: Extremistan field, and most companies do not have a profit, it's usually just one company that generate the profits.
- Look for optionality, with open-ended payoffs.
- Do not invest in business plans but in people.
- Make sure you are barbelled.
- Formal academics: "If quacks are found among non-academics, non-academics are all quacks."

## CHAPTER 16 A Lesson In Disorder

- Skills are non-transferable (no evidence that abilities in chess lead to better reasoning off the chessboard.
- Soccer moms as hindrance to child development: the suppress children's natural love of living things, and removing trial-and-error, and are untrained to handle ambiguity.
- We need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, near-traumatic episodes, and all those things that make life worth living, compared to the structured, fake, and ineffective life of an empty-suit CEO.
- Only autodidacts are free: not just in school, but in life.
- Seneca, re studying: "we do not study for life, but only for the lecture room."

### AN ANTIFRAGILE (BARBELL) EDUCATION

- Taleb's dad was a valedictorian. There are things that intelligent students are unable to understand.
- You can select people based on their ability to hang around, and studious people were not good at hanging around: they needed to have a clear task.
- His father was fascinated with people whose position did not depend on credentials.
- What would an intelligent anti-student need to be?  An autodidact. School favors people in a structured environment, possibly at the expense of performance outside it.
- *Ex: people who lift in the gym can get destroyed in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. Their strength is extremely domain-specific and their domain doesn't exist outside of organized constructs. Their "strength" is the result of a deformity.*
- Same with people who get high grades in subjects rather than learn what they want to learn: watch them lose confidence when they go to places where they didn't study the thing.
- Think of people who are good at putting up with boring meetings and those who were selected for their ability to concentrate on boring shit.
- Barbell autodidact: study the minimum necessary to pass any exam, overshooting sometimes. But I kept reading: humanities, math, science, and history: outside the curriculum. ***Whatever I selected myself, I could read with more depth and more breadth.***
- What people call ADHD, I just used natural stimulation. When I got bored with reading a book, I moved to another book. (Optionality? Hehe.)
- Because there are so many books, is school just designed to deprive people by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors?
- I studied stats because I was getting humiliated by people who use math, because I can't articulate my thing clearly. So I read nothing but risk books.
- "Much of what other people know isn't worth knowing."
- "I remember the things I read on my own, not what I was given to study in school."

## CHAPTER 17 Fat Tony Debates Socrates

- Big mistake: mistaking unintelligible for unintelligent.
- Socrates: no writing of his own, so most of his work is through Plato and Xenophon.
- Taleb is certain that the Socrates of Plato is more Plato than the true Socrates.
- Socrates: for the "activities" with which he was charged by the court (corrupting the youth and introducing new gods at the expense of the older ones), not only he did not charge a fee, but he was in perfect readiness to pay for people to listen to him.
- Euthyphro: Was going to charge his dad with manslaughter. Socrates: is that compatible with Euthyphro's religious duties?
- Socrates's technique: make the guy start off with a thesis, agree to statements, then those statement would be inconsistent with the original thesis, showing how people lacked clarity in their thoughts.
- Socrates: described as a big belly, thin limbs, looked haggard, but he did have a presence, a confidence and a serenity of mind that made young men find him "beautiful."

- The conversation:
  - F: Do I need to tell you what it is to be able to conduct a pious action?
  - S: How can you use it without knowing what it means?
  - F: I don't need to, do you need to define mother's milk to understand the need to drink it? And does a dog need to define what an owner is to be loyal to him?
  - S: No, it has instinct, it does not reflect on its life.
  - F: Are humans so fundamentally different to be completely stripped of instinct, and do we we need to fix the meaning of things?
  - S: We need to know what we are talking about when we talk about things.
  - F: The problem is that you are killing the things we can know but not express. By bullying and questioning people, you confuse them and hurt them.
  - F: ***They are putting you to death, because you make people feel stupid for blindly following habits, instincts, and traditions. You may be right, but you confuse them about things they've been doing just fine without getting into trouble. You are destroying people's illusions about themselves. You are taking the joy of ignorance out of the things we don't understand. And you have not answer to offer them.***
- In defense of Socrates, his questions lead to a major result: if they could not allow him to define what something was, at least they allowed him to be certain about what a thing was not.

### Mistaking the Unintelligible for the Unintelligent

- Nietzsche: "What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent."
- Nietzsche's "The Birth of Tragedy", our natures:
  - Apollonian: measured, balanced, rational, reasonable.
  - Dionysian:  dark, visceral, wild, untamed, hard to understand.
  - Giving a share to Apollonian nature caused the rise of rationalism.
- Growth in knowledge cannot proceed without the Dionysian, use it as a random tinkerer, while using the Apollonian to be rational when selecting things.
- Structured learning likes rationalism, not empiricism/observation.
- *"Because logic excludes nuances, and truth resides exclusively in nuances, it's a useless instrument for finding Truth in the moral and political sciences."*

### Tradition

- Socrates was put to death because he was disrupting something that was working just fine. Things are too complicated to be expressed in words, or people may be focusing on the right things, but are not good enough to figure it out intellectually.
- Socrates: regarded as a hero thanks to his death and dying philosophically.
  - Criticism: he was destroying the foundations of society, the heuristics transmitted by the elders that we may not be mature enough to question.
  - Cato the Elder: "Socrates was a mighty babbler who tried to make himself tyrant of his country in order to destroy its customs and entice its citizens into holding views contrary to law and order."
  - By impoverishing thought, it introduces fragility.
- Incompleteness/half-knowledge is dangerous.
- Edmund Burke
  -  Large social variations can expose us to unseen effects and thus advocated the notion of small trial-and-error experiments.
  - Better to do small trial-and-error experiments in social systems.
  - Traditions provide an aggregation of filtered collective knowledge.

### THE SUCKER-NONSUCKER DISTINCTION

- Fat Tony: the distinction in life isn't True or False, but rather sucker or non-sucker.
  - Exposure is more important than knowledge.
  - Decision effects over logic.
  - Focus on the payoff from your actions, instead of studying the structure of the world.
  - The payoff is always the most important thing, not the even itself.
- ***Philosophers talk about truth and falsehood. People in life talk about payoff, exposure, and consequences (risks and rewards), hence fragility and antifragility. And sometimes philosophers and thinkers and those who study conflate Truth with risks and rewards.***

### Fragility, Not Probability

- We rarely believe people to be terrorists, but we still check them when we board planes, because we are fragile to terrorism.
- We check for the payoff of the true (ex: nuclear plants/safety).
- ***Almost all decisions that you take have some asymmetric payoff. You decide based on fragility, not probability.***
- Even at 99% confidence, with 1% probability of a crash, people still think about that 1%. You often don't think of probabilities, you think of fragile outcomes.
- You have to have the courage to put forth your ideas, and the courage to accept to live in a world they knew they did not understand, and enjoy it.

### What Will Happen Next?

- Ivy League education is becoming a status luxury good.
- Student loans, and it looks like you need a good university to get ahead, but knowing that society doesn't appear to advance with organized education.
- This is fragile: eventually, the thing will collapse.

# BOOK V The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear1

## ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTICS

- For a few years, he concentrated on making his book.
- As a scholar, it turns out that people had a hard time accepting that the job of a scholar is not to give lectures, but to do other things like take walks, and not keep rewriting his book and ideas for the benefit of strangers.
- So Taleb opted out of public life, email filters, and restarted his life, he then had new ideas come to him.

## CHAPTER 18 On the Difference Between a Large Stone and a Thousand Pebbles

- Porcelain cups: wants to be calm/left alone, not volatile/variable/action.
- Getting hit with a large stone hurts way way more than a thousand pebbles.
- This is what fragility is: shocks bring higher harm as their intensity increases.
- There are a lot more ordinary events than extreme events.
- ***For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock.***
- ***For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point).***
- Ex of nonlinear: traffic. There's a point where if you add more cars, traffic becomes a super big problem.
- *This is a hint to a central problem of the world today, that of the misunderstanding of nonlinear response by those involved in creating "efficiencies" and "optimization" of systems.*
- ***A city is not a large village, a corporation is not a larger small business.***
- Other thing: walking versus running + playing a game (the running increases physical fitness).

### How to Be Squeezed

- A squeeze occurs when people have no choice but to do something, and do it right away, regardless of the costs.
- Squeezes are exacerbated by size. When one is large, one becomes vulnerable to some errors, particularly horrendous squeezes. The squeezes become non-linearly costlier as size increases.
- Ex: having an elephant as a pet, if there's a water shortage, you need to pay A LOT of money to feed her (fragility from becoming too big).
- Not a good idea to be large during difficult times.
- Large animals tend to become rapidly extinct.
- Fragility of movie theaters to size when a fire is reported.
- Smooth functioning at regular times is different from rough functioning at times of stress.

### Why Planes Don't Arrive Early

- Uncertainty causes delays/time increase, never decrease.
- The irreversibility of time: if you consider the passage of time as an increase in disorder.
- Black Swan effects are necessarily increasing, as a result of complexity, interdependence between parts, globalization, and the beastly thing called "efficiency" that makes people now sail too close to the wind. The world is getting less and less predictable, and we rely more and more on technologies that have errors and interactions that are harder to estimate, let alone predict.
- IT causes delays.

### Wars, Deficits, and Deficits

- Iraq War: projected to cost 30-60B, ended up costing 2T (indirect costs).
- The larger the military, the disproportionally larger the cost overruns.
- But wars—with more than twentyfold errors—are only illustrative of the way governments underestimate explosive nonlinearities (convexity effects) and why they should not be trusted with finances or any large-scale decisions.
- Indeed, governments do not need wars at all to get us in trouble with deficits: the underestimation of the costs of their projects is chronic for the very same reason 98 percent of contemporary projects have overruns.
- They just end up spending more than they tell us.

### Pollution and Harm to the Planet

- We know that fossil fuels are harmful in a nonlinear way.
- Excessive consumption of things can lead species to extinction, and this harm scales non-linearly.
- Ex: the rich just want to engage in the same activities and buy the same items.

### The Nonlinearity of Wealth

- Wealth means more, and because of nonlinear scaling, more is different.
- We are prone to make more severe errors because we are simply wealthier.
- This comes with growth—at a country level, this Highly Dreamed-of GDP Growth.
- Even at an individual level, wealth means more headaches; we may need to work harder at mitigating the complications arising from wealth than we do at acquiring it.

### Conclusion

- Fragility in any domain, from a porcelain cup to an organism, to a political system, to the size of a firm, or to delays in airports, resides in the nonlinear.

## CHAPTER 19 The Philosopher's Stone and Its Inverse

### HOW TO DETECT WHO WILL GO BUST

- It all boils down to the following: figuring out if our miscalculations or misforecasts are on balance more harmful than they are beneficial, and how accelerating the damage is.
- The technique, a simple heuristic called the fragility (and antifragility) detection heuristic, works as follows.
  - Let's say you want to check whether a town is overoptimized.
  - Say you measure that when traffic increases by ten thousand cars, travel time grows by ten minutes.
  - But if traffic increases by ten thousand more cars, travel time now extends by an extra thirty minutes.
  - Such acceleration of traffic time shows that traffic is fragile and you have too many cars and need to reduce traffic until the acceleration becomes mild (acceleration, I repeat, is acute concavity, or negative convexity effect).

### The Idea of Positive and Negative Model Error

- There are some things like traffic that never experience positive disturbances.
- The notion of "average" can be bad: average temp 70F does not mean anything if it is half 40F and half 100F.
- Grandma's response will not be linear, she will die from those temps.

### NOW THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE

- Recall from our traffic example in Chapter 18 that 90,000 cars for an hour, then 110,000 cars for the next one, for an average of 100,000, and traffic will be horrendous. On the other hand, assume we have 100,000 cars for two hours, and traffic will be smooth and time in traffic short.
- The number of cars is the something, a variable; traffic time is the function of something. The behavior of the function is such that it is, as we said, "not the same thing."

  - The more nonlinear, the more the function of something divorces itself from the something. If traffic were linear, then there would be no difference in traffic time between the two following situations: 90,000, then 110,000 cars on the one hand, or 100,000 cars on the other.
  - The more volatile the something—the more uncertainty—the more the function divorces itself from the something. The function (travel time) depends more on the volatility around the average. Things degrade if there is unevenness of distribution. For the same average you prefer to have 100,000 cars for both time periods; 80,000 then 120,000, would be even worse than 90,000 and 110,000.
  - If the function is convex (antifragile), then the average of the function of something is going to be higher than the function of the average of something. And the reverse when the function is concave (fragile).

### How to Transform Gold into Mud: The Inverse Philosopher's Stone

- If you have favorable asymmetries, or positive convexity, options being a special case, then in the long run you will do reasonably well, outperforming the average in the presence of uncertainty.
- ***The more uncertainty, the more role for optionality to kick in, and the more you will outperform. This property is very central to life.***

## BOOK VI Via Negativa

- There are many things without words, matters that we know and can act on but cannot describe directly, cannot capture in human language or within the narrow human concepts that are available to us.
- Almost anything around us of significance is hard to grasp linguistically—and in fact the more powerful, the more incomplete our linguistic grasp.

### Where Is the Charlatan?

- I have used all my life a wonderfully simple heuristic: charlatans are recognizable in that they will give you positive advice, and only positive advice, exploiting our gullibility and sucker-proneness for recipes that hit you in a flash as just obvious, then evaporate later as you forget them.
- Further, being fooled by randomness is that in most circumstances fraught with a high degree of randomness, one cannot really tell if a successful person has skills, or if a person with skills will succeed—but we can pretty much predict the negative, that a person totally devoid of skills will eventually fail.

### Subtractive Knowledge

- The greatest—and most robust—contribution to knowledge consists in removing what we think is wrong—subtractive epistemology.
- In life, antifragility is reached by not being a sucker.
- ***We know a lot more what is wrong than what is right, or, phrased according to the fragile/robust classification, negative knowledge (what is wrong, what does not work) is more robust to error than positive knowledge (what is right, what works).***
- Negative knowledge is more robust, but it is not perfect.
- In political systems, a good mechanism is one that helps remove the bad guy; it's not about what to do or who to put in. For the bad guy can cause more harm than the collective actions of good ones.
- ***Steve Jobs: "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things."***

### Less Is More

- 80-20 rule, but we are now moving to a 99-1 split in wealth/etc.
- But this can work positively, in that a 99-1 split means you just need to remove the 1% bad people in your company.
- Half the population accounts for < 3% of the costs of medical expenses.
- Less-is-more to aid in decision making: if you have more than one reason to do something, don't do it? Obvious decisions require no more than a single reason.
- ***I have often followed what I call Bergson's razor: "A philosopher should be known for one single idea, not more" (I can't source it to Bergson, but the rule is good enough).***
- So, a heuristic: if someone has a long bio, I skip him—at a conference a friend invited me to have lunch with an overachieving hotshot whose résumé "can cover more than two or three lives".

## CHAPTER 20 Time and Fragility

- Antifragility implies—contrary to initial instinct—that the old is superior to the new, and much more than you think.
- No matter how something looks to your intellectual machinery, or how well or poorly it narrates, time will know more about its fragilities and break it when necessary.

### FROM SIMONIDES TO JENSEN

- As shown from the track record of the prophets: before you are proven right, you will be reviled; after you are proven right, you will be hated for a while, or, what's worse, your ideas will appear to be "trivial" thanks to retrospective distortion.
- This makes it far more convincing to follow the Fat Tony method of focusing on shekels more than recognition.
- The future: what is currently fragile will be replaced by something else.

### LEARNING TO SUBTRACT

- Future forecasts from H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, etc. miss things like the Internet, wheels on suitcases, etc.
- Our world actually looks close to theirs: meeting in restaurant, walking in shoes, using spoons/forks, drinking wine, using glasses.
- ***So, thank God, I will not be dressed in a shiny synthetic space-style suit, consuming nutritionally optimized pills while communicating with my dinner peers by means of screens. The dinner partners, in turn, will be expelling airborne germs on my face, as they will not be located in remote human colonies across the galaxy.***
- *So, the prime error is as follows: When asked to imagine the future, we have the tendency to take the present as a baseline, then produce a speculative destiny by adding new technologies and products to it and what sort of makes sense, given an interpolation of past developments. We also represent society according to our utopia of the moment, largely driven by our wishes—except for a few people called doomsayers, the future will be largely inhabited by our desires.*

### TO AGE IN REVERSE: THE LINDY EFFECT

- Tech: the longer a tech lives, the longer it can be expected to live (as opposed to people, where the older you are, the lower your life expectancy is).
- Remember the following principle: I am not saying that all technologies do not age, only that those technologies that were prone to aging are already dead.
- I received an interesting letter from Paul Doolan from Zurich, who was wondering how we could teach children skills for the twenty-first century since we do not know which skills will be needed in the twenty-first century—he figured out an elegant application of the large problem that Karl Popper called the error of historicism. Effectively my answer would be to make them read the classics. The future is in the past. Actually there is an Arabic proverb to that effect: he who does not have a past has no future.6

### A FEW MENTAL BIASES

- Information has a nasty property: it hides failures.
- Many people have been drawn to, say, financial markets after hearing success stories of someone getting rich in the stock market and building a large mansion across the street—but since failures are buried and we don't hear about them, investors are led to overestimate their chances of success.
- *So we confuse the necessary and the causal: because all surviving technologies have some obvious benefits, we are led to believe that all technologies offering obvious benefits will survive.*
- ***Another mental bias causing the over-hyping of technology comes from the fact that we notice change, not statics. Variation is easier to notice.***

### Neomania and Treadmill Effects

- With so many cool new things, we notice their differences, not their commonalities.
- We tire of what we have, and search for versions 2.0.
- But we don't have this hedonistic treadmill thing when it comes to art/dishes.
- Comparing e-readers to other e-readers is comparing specs, and comparing e-readers to books is on big differences like smell/texture, etc.
- ***It also so happens that whatever is technological happens to be fragile. Articles made by an artisan cause fewer treadmill effects. And they tend to have some antifragility—recall how my artisanal shoes take months before becoming comfortable.***

### TURNING SCIENCE INTO JOURNALISM

- So time can act as a cleanser of noise by confining to its dustbins all these overhyped works.
- If we replace scientific results with scientists, we often get the same neomaniac hype. There is a disease to grant a prize for a promising scientist "under forty," a disease that is infecting economics, mathematics, finance, etc.
- *Of the fields I am familiar with, such as literature, finance, and economics, I can pretty much ascertain that the prizes given to those under forty are the best reverse indicator of value. Should we have a prize, it should be for "over a hundred".*
- ***I complete this section with the following anecdote. One of my students (who was majoring in, of all subjects, economics) asked me for a rule on what to read. "As little as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books that are not about the last fifty years," I blurted out, with irritation as I hate such questions as "what's the best book you've ever read," or "what are the ten best books,"—my "ten best books ever" change at the end of every summer.***

### PROPHETS AND THE PRESENT

- By issuing warnings based on vulnerability—that is, subtractive prophecy—we are closer to the original role of the prophet: to warn, not necessarily to predict, and to predict calamities if people don't listen.
- ***The classical role of the prophet, at least in the Levantine sense, is not to look into the future but to talk about the present. He tells people what to do, or, rather, in my opinion, the more robust what not to do.***
- Historically, prophets have had a hard time/were prosecuted.
- Delivering new messages should be greeted with new understanding in mind.
- Something deemed "original" usually tends to be modeled on something that was new at the time, but is no longer new.

### EMPEDOCLES' DOG

- A dog prefers to always sleep on the same tile.
- The human technologies that survive, such as writing and reading, are like the tile to the dog, because they correspond to something deep in our nature.
- If something that makes no sense to you (religion to an atheist or old habits/practices) has been around for a long time, expect it to stick around for much longer.

## CHAPTER 21 Medicine, Convexity, and Opacity

- Evidence of no disease is different from no evidence of disease.
- "Harmful" or "beneficial" break down.
- Ex: no actual logic to icing your nose once it swelled (this was your body's reaction to it getting hit).
- We do not need evidence of harm to claim that a drug is dangerous.
- The history of trans fat: humans were convinced that they could make a better fat than the one found in nature. Trans fat was convenient and they were cheaper, and assumed to be healthier. Turns out that it actually kills people.
- ***Iatrogenics: beneficial in the short term/benefits are small, and the costs are very large, delayed, and hidden.***
- Iatrogenics: non-linear. Applying drugs to healthy people is really different from applying them to sick people. The treatment benefits are convex to condition.
- There is rarely a drug that makes a healthy person unconditionally better (nature is more likely to find this herself). Ex: steroids, what appears as a free lunch has a hidden risk.
- What made medicine mislead people for so long is that its successes were prominently displayed, and its mistakes literally buried—just like so many other interesting stories in the cemetery of history.
- ***There is a marked bias in favor of treatment, even when it brings more harm, because the legal system favors intervention.***
- ***If there is something in nature you don't understand, odds are it makes sense in a deeper way that is beyond your understanding. So there is a logic to natural things that is much superior to our own. Because of track record, there is nothing on the planet that can be close to statistically significant as nature.***

## CHAPTER 22 To Live Long, but Not Too Long

- We are antifragile to randomness in food delivery/composition. Antifragility to the fast. Breaking the fast is like the opposite of a hangover.
- Compare: stressing yourself with exercise, and stressing yourself with food deprivation.
- In nature, we had to expend energy to eat, we do not receive food from the delivery person.

# BOOK VII The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility

## CHAPTER 23 Skin in the Game: Antifragility and Optionality at the Expense of Others

- The worst problem of modernity: someone getting the benefits while someone else gets the harm.
- Old societies: someone elects to bear the disadvantage for the sake of others. People are only as respectable as the downside they are willing to face for the sake of others.
- What we have: power goes to bankers, executives, politicians, who steal a free option from society. No skin in the game.
- Plato courage: the courage to stand up for an idea and enjoy death in a state of thrill, because the privilege of dying for truth becomes the highest form of honor.
- Glorified heroism: "middle-class values" of "hard work", corporate slavery, legal compliance, relying on the stock market, suburban life.
- A half-man: someone who does not take risks for their opinions.
- ***Dignity is worth nothing unless you earn it, and unless you are willing to pay a price for it.***
- Hammurabi: if the builder builds a house and the house collapses, the builder will be put to death.
- ***People voting for war need to have at least one descendant exposed to combat.***
- Every opinion maker needs to have "skin in the game" in the even of harm caused by reliance on his information or opinion.
- Anyone making an economic forecast needs to have something to lose from it.
- Information age: transferring fragility is more acute now.

### Postdicting

- ***Words are dangerous: postdictors, who explain things after the fact—because they are in the business of talking—always look smarter than predictors.***
- The past is fluid, marred with selection biases and constantly revised memories. It is a central property of suckers that they will never know they were the suckers because that's how our minds work.
- The asymmetry (antifragility of postdictors): postdictors can cherry-pick and produce instances in which their opinions played out.
- Since they have the option, the fragilistas are personally antifragile: volatility tends to benefit them: the more volatility, the higher the illusion of intelligence.
- ***When you look at the actual history of someone's activities, instead of what thoughts he will deliver after the facts, things become crystal clear. The option is gone. Reality removes the uncertainty, the imprecision, the vagueness, the self-serving mental biases that make us appear more intelligent.***
- You would discover that many people who claim to have foreseen the collapse of the financial system had financial companies in their portfolios.
- I want predictors to have visible scars on their body from prediction errors, not distribute these errors to society.
- You cannot sit and moan about the world. You need to come out on top.
- At the core, people are dangerous when they have that strange skill that allows their papers to be published in journals but decreases their understanding of risk. So the very same economist who caused the problem then postdicted the crisis, and then became a theorist on what happened. No wonder we will have larger crises.
- ***Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just ask them what they have—or don't have—in their portfolio.***
- ***Never ask the doctor what you should do. Ask him what he would do if he were in your place. You would be surprised at the difference.***

### The Problem of Frequency, or How to Lose Arguments

- Fat Tony: "making a buck" as opposed to being "proven right."
- Suckers try to win arguments, nonsuckers try to win.
- To put it again in other words: it is rather a good thing to lose arguments.
Our mission is to make talk less cheap.
- On cowardice: if a legion loses a battle, 10% (randomly) would be put to death. Decimation (eliminating one in ten) comes from this concept.
- ***Playing on one's inner agency problem can go beyond symmetry: give soldiers no options and see how antifragile they can get.***
- "Behind you is the sea, before you, the enemy. You are vastly outnumbered. All you have is sword and courage." Never put your enemy's back to the wall.

### The Problem of Insulation

- The philosopher Myles Burnyeat called this the "problem of insulation," particularly with skeptics who are skeptics in one domain but not another.
- He provides the example of a philosopher who puzzles about the reality of time, but who nonetheless applies for a research grant to work on the philosophical problem of time during next year's sabbatical—without doubting the reality of next year's arrival.
- ***I believe that forcing researchers to eat their own cooking whenever possible solves a serious problem in science. Take this simple heuristic—does the scientific researcher whose ideas are applicable to the real world apply his ideas to his daily life? If so, take him seriously. Otherwise, ignore him.***
- Never listen to a leftist who does not give away his fortune or does not live the exact lifestyle he wants others to follow.

### Soul in the Game

- Soul in the game: prophets. Prophecy is a pledge of belief, little else. A prophet is not someone who first had an idea; he is the one to first believe in it—and take it to its conclusion.
- Only he who has true beliefs will avoid eventually contradicting himself and falling into the errors of postdicting.

### OPTIONS, ANTIFRAGILITY, AND SOCIAL FAIRNESS

- ***The stock market: the greatest, industrial-sized, transfer of antifragility in history—due to a vicious form of asymmetric skin in the game. Not investment, but packaging investments, with managers allowed to game the system, and of course, getting more prestige than the real risk takers, the entrepreneurs.***
- *There is a difference between a manager running a company that is not his own and an owner-operated business in which the manager does not need to report numbers to anyone but himself, and for which he has a downside.*
- The asymmetry is visibly present: volatility benefits managers since they only get one side of the payoffs.
- If the market goes up 50% then goes back down, it's profitable to managers, vs the market not moving at all.
- Society pays for the losses of bankers, but gets no bonuses from them.

### THE ANTIFRAGILITY AND ETHICS OF (LARGE) CORPORATIONS

- ***The problem of the commercial world is that it only works by addition, not subtraction: pharmaceutical companies don't gain if you avoid sugar; the manufacturer of health club machines doesn't benefit from your deciding to lift stones and walk on rocks (without a cell phone); your stockbroker doesn't gain from your decision to limit your investments to what you see with your own eyes, say your cousin's restaurant or an apartment building in your neighborhood; all these firms have to produce "growth in revenues" to satisfy the metric of some slow thinking or, at best, semi-slow thinking MBA analyst sitting in New York. Of course they will eventually self-destruct, but that's another conversation.***
- What business is Coke/Pepsi in?? Selling you sugary water or substitutes for sugar, putting into your body stuff that messes up your biological signaling system, causing diabetes and making diabetes vendors rich thanks to their compensatory drugs.
  - Large corporations certainly can't make money selling you tap water and cannot produce wine (wine seems to be the best argument in favor of the artisanal economy).
  - But they dress their products up with a huge marketing apparatus, with images that fool the drinker and slogans such as "125 years of providing happiness" or some such.
  - I fail to see why the arguments we've used against tobacco firms don't apply—to some extent—to all other large companies that try to sell us things that may make us ill.
- Large bureaucratic corporations seized control of the state by being "big employers", and can extract benefits at the expense of small businesses.
- Large companies are in the business of producing wholesale Iatrogenics and using the state with their lobbyists.
- Marketing is bad manners: why not act with some personal humility? Marketing, beyond conveying information, is insecurity.
- We accept that people who boast are boastful and turn people off. How about companies? Why aren't we turned off by companies that advertise how great they are?
  - Companies are shamelessly self-promotional.
  - Companies represent themselves in the most favorable light possible, hiding the defects of their product.
  - Companies misrepresent their product by playing with our cognitive biases (ex: Marlboro connecting romance with smoking).
- ***A (publicly listed) corporation does not feel shame. We humans are restrained by some physical, natural inhibition.***
  - A corporation does not feel pity.
  - A corporation does not have a sense of honor—while, alas, marketing documents mention "pride."
  - A corporation does not have generosity. Only self-serving actions are acceptable. Just imagine what would happen to a corporation that decided to unilaterally cancel its receivables—just to be nice. Yet societies function thanks to random acts of generosity between people, even sometimes strangers.
  - All of these defects are the result of the absence of skin in the game, cultural or biological—an asymmetry that harms others for their benefit.
- ***In sum, corporations are so fragile, long-term, that they eventually collapse under the weight of the agency problem, while managers milk them for bonuses and ditch the bones to taxpayers. They would collapse sooner if not for the lobby machines: they start hijacking the state to help them inject sugary drinks into your esophagus.***
- Institutions do not have a sense of honor, individuals do.
- My suggestion to deter "too big to fail" and prevent employers from taking advantage of the public is as follows. A company that is classified as potentially bailable out should it fail should not be able to pay anyone more than a corresponding civil servant.
- Otherwise people should be free to pay each other what they want since it does not affect the taxpayer. Such limitation would force companies to stay small enough that they would not be considered for a bailout in the event of their failure.

## CHAPTER 24 Fitting Ethics to a Profession

- Tony: "Nero, you sucker. Don't be fooled by money. These are just numbers. Being self-owned is a state of mind."
- Greed is antifragile, but its victims are not.
- Does wealth make people more independent? Most wealthy people are on some kind of hedonistic treadmill. You can't trust someone on that treadmill.

### THE PROFESSIONALS AND THE COLLECTIVE

- You can be enslaved to a profession.
- Demades the Athenian condemned a man who traded in funeral goods on the grounds that he could only derive profits by the death of the great many people.
  - Montaigne, rephrasing the argument made by Seneca in his De beneficiis, argued that we would then be obligated to condemn every single professional.
  - According to him, the merchant only thrives by the debauchery of youth, the farmer by the dearness of grain, the architect by the ruin of buildings, lawyers and officers of justice by the suits and contentions of men.
  - A physician takes no pleasure in the health of even his friends, a soldier does not wish for the peace of his country, etc.
  - And, even worse, should we go into people's inner and private thoughts and motivations, we would see that their wishes and hopes are almost invariably at someone else's expense.
- While that is true, those professionals still have skin in the game (reputation).

- For Aristotle, humanity started at the rank of idle freeman, un-preoccupied with work.
- It never meant not working; it just meant not deriving your personal and emotional identity from your work, and viewing work as something optional, more like a hobby.
  - In a way your profession does not identify you so much as other attributes, here your birth.
  - This is the f you money that allowed Thales of Miletus to gauge his own sincerity. For the Spartans, it was all about courage.
  - For Fat Tony, humanity started at the level of "self-ownership."
  - ***In other words, for Fat Tony, it was a very, very specific definition of a free person: someone who cannot be squeezed into doing something he would otherwise never do.***
- If for the Greeks, only he who is free with his time is free with his opinion, for Fat Tony, only he who has courage is free with his opinion. Sissies are born, not made. They stay sissies no matter how much independence you give them, no matter how rich they get.

### THE ETHICAL AND THE LEGAL

- T***he more complex the regulation, the more bureaucratic the network, the more a regulator who knows the loops and glitches would benefit from it later, as his regulator edge would be a convex function of his differential knowledge.***
- The more complicated the regulation, the more prone to arbitrages by insiders. *The incentive of a regulator is to have complex regulation.* Again, the insiders are the enemies of the less-is-more rule.
- Harder to detect/differentiate between the letter and the spirit of regulation. Easier to game complex environments.

### Casuistry as Optionality

- Fraudulent opinion: one with vested interests, but generalized to the public good (a gun lobbyist claiming gun ownership is good for America, only making statements that benefit him personally).
- If someone has an opinion, I want him invested in it, just to make sure that he is not an empty suit.
- More data means more information, but it also means more false information.

## CHAPTER 25 Conclusion

- Everything in religious law comes down to the refinements, applications, and interpretations of the Golden Rule, "Don't do unto others what you don't want them to do to you."
- Look around you, at your life, at objects, at relationships, at entities.
- ***Education, in the sense of the formation of character, personality, and acquisition of true knowledge, likes disorder; label-driven education and educators abhor disorder.***
- *Some things break because of error, others don't. Some theories fall apart, not others. Innovation is precisely something that gains from uncertainty: and some people sit around waiting for uncertainty and using it as raw material, just like our ancestral hunters.*
- The glass is dead; living things are long volatility. The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations. Remember that food would not have a taste if it weren't for hunger; results are meaningless without effort, joy without sadness, convictions without uncertainty, and an ethical life isn't so when stripped of personal risks.

## Glossary

- Procrustean bed: Procrustes got people to fit perfectly into his bed by cutting or stretching their limbs. Corresponds to situations in which simplifications are not simplifications.
- Fragilista: Someone who causes fragility because he thinks he understands what's going on.
- Lecturing-Birds-How-to-Fly Effect: Inverting the arrow of knowledge to read academia → practice, or education → wealth, to make it look as though technology owes more to institutional science than it actually does.
- Touristification: The attempt to suck randomness out of life.
- Rational flaneur (or just flaneur): Someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision opportunistically at every step to revise his schedule (or his destination) so he can imbibe things based on new information obtained. Looking for opportunity.
- Barbell Strategy: A dual strategy, a combination of two extremes, one safe and one speculative, deemed more robust than a "monomodal" strategy; often a necessary condition for antifragility.
  - For instance, in biological systems, the equivalent of marrying an accountant and having an occasional fling with a rock star; for a writer, getting a stable sinecure and writing without the pressures of the market during spare time. Even trial and error are a form of barbell.
- Iatrogenics: Harm done by the healer, as when the doctor's interventions do more harm than good.
- Generalized Iatrogenics: By extension, applies to the harmful side effects of actions by policy makers and activities of academics.
- Tantalized Class: An economic condition of making more than minimum wage and wishing for more wealth. Workers, monks, hippies, some artists, and English aristocrats escape it. Members are bribable provided they are given an adequate narrative, mostly with the use of casuistry.

### Black Swan Errors

- Nonpredictive Approach: Building stuff in a manner immune to perturbations—hence robust to changes in future outcomes.
- Thalesian versus Aristotelian: The Thalesian focuses on exposure, payoff from decision; the Aristotelian focuses on logic, the True-False distinction. For Fat Tony, the problem is all about sucker-nonsucker, or risks and rewards. (Also see nonlinearities, convexity effects.)
- Conflation of Event and Exposure: Mistaking a function of a variable for the variable itself.
- Naturalistic Risk Management: The belief that, when it comes to risk management, Mother Nature has a much, much more significant track record than rationalistic humans. It is imperfect, but much better.
- Burden of evidence: The burden of evidence falls on those who disrupt the natural, or those who propose via positive policies.
- Ludic Fallacy: Mistaking the well-posed problems of mathematics and laboratory experiments for the ecologically complex real world. Includes mistaking the randomness in casinos for that in real life.
- Hormesis: A bit of a harmful substance, or stressor, in the right dose or with the right intensity, stimulates the organism and makes it better, stronger, healthier, and prepared for a stronger dose the next exposure.
- Naive Interventionism: The preference, even obligation, to "do something" over doing nothing.
- Naive Rationalism: Thinking that the reasons for things are, by default, accessible to university buildings.
- Turkey and Inverse Turkey: The turkey is fed by the butcher for a thousand days, and every day the turkey pronounces with increased statistical confidence that the butcher "will never hurt it"—until Thanksgiving, which brings a Black Swan revision of belief for the turkey. The inverse turkey error is the mirror confusion, not seeing opportunities—pronouncing that one has evidence that someone digging for gold or searching for cures will "never find" anything.
- Doxastic Commitment, or "Soul in the Game": You must only believe predictions and opinions by those who committed themselves to a certain belief, and had something to lose, in a way to pay a cost in being wrong.
- Heuristics: Simple, practical, easy-to-apply rules of thumb that make life easy. These are necessary (we do not have the mental power to absorb all information and tend to be confused by details) but they can get us in trouble as we do not know we are using them when forming judgments.
- Opaque Heuristic: Routine performed by societies that does not seem to make sense yet has been done for a long time and sticks for unknown reasons.
- Dionysian: Opaque heuristic seemingly irrational, named after Dionysos (or Bacchus for Romans), the god of wine and revelling. Is contrasted to the Apollonian, which represents order.
- Agency Problem: Situation in which the manager of a business is not the true owner, so he follows a strategy that cosmetically seems to be sound, but in a hidden way benefits him and makes him antifragile at the expense (fragility) of the true owners or society. When he is right, he collects large benefits; when he is wrong, others pay the price. Typically this problem leads to fragility, as it is easy to hide risks. It also affects politicians and academics. A major source of fragility.
- Hammurabi Risk Management: The idea that a builder has more knowledge than the inspector and can hide risks in the foundations where they can be most invisible; the remedy is to remove the incentive in favor of delayed risk.
- Green Lumber Fallacy: Mistaking the source of important or even necessary knowledge—the greenness of lumber—for another, less visible from the outside, less tractable one. How theoreticians impute wrong weights to what one should know in a certain business or, more generally, how many things we call "relevant knowledge" aren't so much so.
- Skin in the Game / Captain and Ship Rule: Every captain goes down with every ship. This removes the agency problem and the lack of doxastic commitment.
- Empedocles' Tile: A dog sleeps on the same tile because of a natural, biological, explainable or nonexplainable match, confirmed by long series of recurrent frequentation. We may never know the reason, but the match is there. Example: why we read books.
- Cherry-picking: Selecting from the data what serves to prove one's point and ignoring disconfirming elements.
- Ethical Problems as Transfers of Asymmetry (fragility): Someone steals antifragility and optionality from others, getting the upside and sticking others with the downside. "Others' skin in the game."
- The Robert Rubin violation: Stolen optionality. Getting upside from a strategy without downside for oneself, leaving the harm to society. Rubin got $120 million in compensation from Citibank; taxpayers are retrospectively paying for his errors.
- The Alan Blinder problem: (1) Using privileges of office retrospectively at the expense of citizens. (2) Violating moral rules while complying perfectly with the law; confusion of ethical and legal. (3) The regulator's incentive to make complicated regulations in order to subsequently sell his "expertise" to the private sector.
- The Joseph Stiglitz problem: Lack of penalty from bad recommendation causing harm to others. Mental cherry-picking, leading to contributing to the cause of a crisis while being convinced of the opposite—and thinking he predicted it. Applies to people with opinions without skin in the game.
- Rational Optionality: Not being locked into a given program, so one can change his mind as he goes along based on discovery or new information.
- Ethical Inversion: Fitting one's ethics to actions (or profession) rather than the reverse.
- Narrative Fallacy: Our need to fit a story, or pattern, to a series of connected or disconnected facts. The statistical application is data mining.
- Narrative Discipline: Discipline that consists of fitting a convincing and good-sounding story to the past. Opposed to experimental discipline. A great way to fool people is to use statistics as part of the narrative, by ferreting out "good stories" from the data thanks to cherry picking; in medicine, epidemiological studies tend to be marred with the narrative fallacy, less so controlled experiments. Controlled experiments are more rigorous, less subjected to cherry-picking.
- Non-narrative action: Does not depend on a narrative for the action to be right—the narrative is just there to motivate, entertain, or prompt action.
- Robust Narrative: When the narrative does not produce opposite conclusions or recommendations for action under change of assumption or environment. The narrative is otherwise fragile. Similarly, a robust model or mathematical tool does not lead to different policies when you change some parts of the model.
- Subtractive Knowledge: You know what is wrong with more certainty than you know anything else. An application of via negativa.
- Via negativa: In theology and philosophy, the focus on what something is not, an indirect definition. In action, it is a recipe for what to avoid, what not to do—subtraction, not addition, say, in medicine.
- Subtractive Prophecy: Predicting the future by removing what is fragile from it rather than naively adding to it. An application of via negativa.
- Lindy Effect: A technology, or anything nonperishable, increases in life expectancy with every day of its life—unlike perishable items (such as humans, cats, dogs, and tomatoes). So a book that has been a hundred years in print is likely to stay in print another hundred years.
- Neomania: A love of change for its own sake, a form of philistinism that does not comply with the Lindy effect and understands fragility. Forecasts the future by adding, not subtracting.
- Opacity: You do not see the barrel when someone is playing Russian roulette. More generally, some things remain opaque to us, leading to illusions of understanding.
- Mediocristan: A process dominated by the mediocre, with few extreme successes or failures (say, income for a dentist). No single observation can meaningfully affect the aggregate. Also called "thin-tailed," or member of the Gaussian family of distributions.
- Extremistan: A process where the total can be conceivably impacted by a single observation (say, income for a writer). Also called "fat-tailed." Includes the fractal, or power-law, family of distributions.
- Nonlinearities, Convexity Effects (smiles and frowns): Nonlinearities can be concave or convex, or a mix of both. The term convexity effects is an extension and generalization of the fundamental asymmetry. The technical name for fragility is negative convexity effects and for antifragility is positive convexity effects. Convex is good (a smiley), concave is bad (a frowny).
- Philosopher's Stone, also called Convexity Bias (very technical): The exact measure of benefits derived from nonlinearity or optionality (or, even more technically, the difference between x and a convex function of x). For instance, such bias can quantify the health benefits of variable intensity of pulmonary ventilation over steady pressure, or compute the gains from infrequent feeding. The Procrustean bed from the neglect of nonlinearity (to "simplify") lies in assuming such convexity bias does not exist.
