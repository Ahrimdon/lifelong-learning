# Adulting: How to Become a Grown-Up

- It is these small discoveries and decisions that allow you to behave like an adult. Not really fun, but it has its perks--personal pride, financial security, and the feeling of accomplishment and control.
- Adulting is not a noun, it's a verb, it's the act of making correctly those small decisions that fill our day. If you slip up, just move forward and have milk tomorrow.
- Most of being an adult is not up in your head, it's in your actions.

## 1. Get Your Mind Right.

- *Intentions are nice, but ultimately, intentions don't matter because they only insist inside you.*

### Steps

- Accept that you are not that special.
- Appreciate those (parents, friends) who disagree with step 1.
- Don't get hurt when the world doesn't care about you. It's not that they hate you, it just has no idea who you are. People will come to care about you, but only if you give them a valid reason.
- Accept that right now, you are small time. You're starting from the beginning, just like every other person in the world must do.
- Reasonable goals: There will never be a time when every item in the house is meticulously organized in cute storage solutions.
- Stop enjoying things ironically. Just enjoy them. Things like trashy dance pop.
- Avoid shame boomerangs.
  - Shame boomerangs: shame incident -> bad feelings -> forgetting/getting distracted -> shame boomerang -> bad feelings.
  - Acknowledge the problem.
  - Figure out how you will avoid making this same mistake again.
  - Decide on a coping mechanism.
  - Really try not to make the mistake again.
- Remember your circle of concern vs your circle of action.
  - There are things you can be concerned about and things you can actually effect change on. Work on those things.
-  Begin to separate, in your mind, things that are a Valid Long-Term Plan vs Not A Valid Long-Term Plan.
  - Boyfriends you love but you know you don't want to spend the rest of your life with.
  - Smoking.
  - Jobs with little or no possibility for advancement.
  - Drinking problems.
- Be okay with being alone. NOBODY THINKS ABOUT "why is that person alone", they have their own things.
- Recognize six-month problems. When you get really upset about something, ask yourself, is this something you'll remember in six months? Most things aren't. If no, then try your best to move on.
- Distinguish between horses and zebras. "Not always, but probably."
- Pay attention to natural consequences, then learn to anticipate them. A natural consequences of splurging is you can't go out with friends. A natural consequence of hooking up with someone at work is you get to remember it when you go to a meeting together.
- Remember that you are in control of your physical self and surroundings. You can make your bed or you can not make your bed. Neither makes you a better or worse person, but you should accept that if you want to your bed to be made, there is but one person in the world who is going to do it, and that person is you.
- When necessary, look at yourself in the mirror and give yourself some real talk.  *This sounds a little crazy, but looking yourself in the eye in the mirror and saying something aloud is oddly effective. It makes whatever you are trying so hard to mentally avoid into something that exists in the real world.* It reminds you that the lies, or truths, you tell yourself are as significant as the lies and truths you tell others.
  - This relationship is over, and you need to end it.
  - Right now is not the right time to be crying at work. You are a grown-ass woman, and you're going to splash cold water on your face, take a minute to compose yourself, and then go slay it out there.
  - There is a difference between berating yourself and Real Talking yourself.
- When something bad happens to you, do not rush immediately to figure out why it wasn't your fault. What lesson can be learned here?
- Get used to giving more than you get.

## Domesticity

- Buy toilet paper in bulk. Toilet paper is something that you will always, always need. For things that you will always need, just buy in bulk.
- The right place.
  - Hot water.
  - Safety. Come back by the area at night, during the day, on the weekend, and so on.
  - Volume: Is there something loud nearby?
  - Management: Does the landlord seem reasonable? Make sure they set off no Insanity Bells. It's okay to chat with another tenant and see what kind of person you are entering into a long term legal contract with.
  - Electricity: Check all the light switches, and bring a cellphone charger.
  - Closets/storage: Do they exist?
  - Appliances.
  - Accessibility: Can your furniture logically get up the stairs and into the apartment?
  - Pets.
  - Paint. Can you paint the walls?
- Be a good tenant. 90% of this is paying your rent on time, but also be sure to alert landlords right away when there is a problem.
- Learn how to patch nail holes.
- If you need to match paint, chip off a pain sample so they can scan and match shade perfectly.
- Bare minimum:
  - Kitchen: A small table and 2 chairs.
  - Living room: A couch, bookcase or shelving, and a coffee table. Then: desk, love seat, chair, side tables, something to set up the TV in.
  - Bedroom: A bed, nightstand, and a dresser, vanity.
  - Bathroom: Storage option.
- How to decorate
  - Match your closet. Whatever you like as a person, you'll like it in home decor. Start off with an object that you really like. Whenever she wanted to add something to her room, it must match the object. Painting just one wall makes a large difference.
- Frames, not posters. Art is something else that you can slowly but surely acquire. It doesn't have to be insanely expensive, but treat them right, and get them framed.
- Get an actual bed. Mattress stores are weirdly into haggling, so start by really low-balling them.
- Correspondence drawer: something that will allow you to send a letter or a check immediately.
- Buy tools.
  - Hammer.
  - Adjustable screwdriver.
  - Crescent wrench.
  - Tape measure.
  - Cordless drill.
- Keys: One to a friend and one somewhere near your house, but is hidden.
- If you are really terrible at cleaning, it may be worth it to hire a cleaner, and ask if they can tutor you while they clean.
- Do some cleaning daily. Dishes, hang up your clothes, put others in the laundry.
- Make your bed every morning. It's way nice to get into a made bed. The longest sheets should go without washing is two weeks; wash them in warm water by themselves, using half the usual amount of detergent.
- When to mindlessly tidy:
  - While on the phone.
  - When having something while cooking.
  - While waiting for the bath to fill or the shower water to heat.
- Garbage--leftover, crusty food is not made into anything except compost.

#### Bucket List

- Dawn dish soap.
- Broom and dustpan.
- Mop.
- Bucket.
- Paper towels.
- Rags.
- A scrubber.
- A toothbrush for little crevices.
- Bleach, but always have gloves on while.
- Cheap white vinegar--one part vinegar to two parts hot water is a wonderful glass cleaner.
- Spray bleach solution.
- Knee pads to make scrubbing easier.
- Latex cleaning gloves.
- Pledge for wood.
- Goo Gone.
- A duster.
- Toilet plunger.

#### Weekly Cleaning

- Clean your bathroom.
- Do your laundry, including bed linens.
- Sweep and mop non-carpet surfaces.
- Check corners for cobwebs.
- Wipe down surfaces. Wet rag and dry rag.
- If you have a pet, think about vacuuming.
- Bleach your sink, tub, and toilet. Fill them with hot water, and perhaps half a cup of bleach to a tub or between an eighth and a quarter cup to a sink, then let it sit for twenty minutes. After you've drained and rinsed, any remaining grime is super easy to get off.
- *Do not keep things in your house that make you feel sad or bad.*
- Things that live in the same room can and should go in boxes together.
- Wrap fragile items with newspaper (more than seems reasonable) then seal with a little bit of tape.
- If a larger item needs a smaller item to function, tape them together (TV remotes to TVs, IKEA furniture to its screws.)
- Soft tings to in big garbage bags which you can toss.

## Cooking

- Medium-size saucepan, a large saucepan, a large frying pan, and a griddle. Knives--really where you should spend some cash. Get a chef's knife and a sharpener. Paring, bread knife.
- Six big plates, six little plates, six bowls, six glasses, six forks, six butter knives, six spoons, six pint glasses, and six wineglasses.
- Can opener
- Spatula
- Ladle
- Wooden spoons
- Salt/pepper shakers
- Whisk
- Measuring cups/spoons
- Colander
- Corkscrew
- Vegetable peeler
- Box grater
- Roasting pan
- Dutch oven
- Toaster
- Food processor
- Rolling pin
- Handheld juicer

### Ingredients

- Black/pinto beans, brown/white rice, lentils, oatmeal, pasta, cereal, wheat bread.
- Olive oil, butter, bacon fat.
- Flour, sugar, honey, vanilla extract, baking powder, baking soda, cranberries.
- Balsamic vinegar, white wine vinegar, parsley, onions, garlic, ketchup, mayo hot sauce, soy sauce, thyme dill, oregano, basil.
- Milk, eggs, potatoes, onions, apples, fruit and veggies for snacking.

- Air is the enemy when it comes to storing or freezing leftovers. Get all possible air out before it goes in the freezer.
- Meat should be put in the freezer within 2 days.

### Cooking

- Baking. Oven. Warm dry heat rises from the bottom. Dry heat.
- Boiling. Submerging an item in water or stock that is boiling. Poaching = happens in hot but not super-hot water, bubbles shouldn't be showing. Simmering: tiny bubbles are forming continuously on the bottom. Rolling boil involves the whole surface of the water moving as one. Boil is calmer, involves constant bubbles the size of the tip of your pinkie.
- Braising. Partially covering the item with liquid (might be beef stock or red wine) then putting a lid on the pot so it is sort of both poached and steamed.
- Broiling. Top of the oven, very fat.
- Frying. Enough fat is put in a pan to cover the bottom, then the item is placed in the hot fat. This is a great way to start meat that will be baked, as it gives it that crispy delicious exterior. *Don't put too much of anything in at once when you're frying. When things are fried, they're generally giving off moisture.*
- Sauteing. On a pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Turn the element on, then add some fat and let is spread out.
- Until you are a good cook, follow recipes.
- Master the breakfasts you like.
- Master oatmeal.
- Master making soup. Some veggies-potatoes, carrots, some other hard ones take take longer to cook than say, spinach.
- Sandwiches. Master grilled sandwiches.
- Master the meal salad.
  - Greens: Mixed salads, spinach, thinly sliced chard, mustard greens, watercress, and lettuce.
  - Fruit/vegetable: Apple, pear, asparagus, cucumber, steamed broccoli, avocado, tomato, carrot.
  - Nut/meat: Bacon, chicken breast, most nuts.
  - Cheese.
- Dressing:
  - Balsamic vinaigrette.
- Non-bullshit potatoes: roasted garlic, baked potatoes.
- Make a decent steak. Suggested: rib eye.
- Get a crock-pot or generic slow-cooker.
- Throw a dinner party. Cook things you know how to cook, because it's a bad time to experiment. Think of how the afternoon beforehand will look like. Dinner = meat, starch, and a vegetable.
- Cheese plate:
  - One soft cheese (brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Muenster).
  - One hard cheese (pecorino, Manchego, Emmentaler).
  - One orange cheese (Cheddar, Cotswold, Gouda).
  - One bread.
  - One accent (strawberries, olives, asparagus, mushrooms, artichoke hearts).
- Puff pastry?
- Good idea to have crackers/cheese/grapes/chilled water.
- Washing dishes:
  - Fill a clean kitchen sink with nice/hot water and add some squirts of Dawn/bleach. Let your dirty dishes sit in this for twenty minutes, then put on your latex gloves. One by one, take the items out of the water, scrub with a sponge, then rinse thoroughly in hot water.
  - Wood shouldn't soak in water, so just clean it using your soapy, bleachy water.
  - Cast iron should never ever go in water because it rusts. To clean it, rinse with hot water and use a scrubber, but not steel wool to get all the food off. Put it on the stove over low heat to evaporate all the water, then put a small amount of vegetable oil on a paper towel.

## Fake It Till You Make It

- *Remember that the outside world only sees your outermost layer.*
- Watch your mouth.
- Spend ten minutes a day gathering news, at least.
- Develop your own opinions.
- Revisit your perception of partying: parties as adults are different from parties as college students.
- RSVP: Do not "maybe". RSVP with yes, no, or "let me check my schedule". Saying maybe is: "perhaps I'll go if nothing better comes up", "your invitation isn't important enough for me to decide one way or another", "or "I am a flaker".
- Err on the side of attending events even if you don't totally feel like it.
- Appearance, then bounce: Show up on time, hang out, the casually drop the You Cannot Stay with deep regret tone. Just say you have a prior commitment.
- Glamorous people are not all that glamorous.
- If you don't know anyone, well most probably they are not noticing.
- Listen more than you talk.
- Don't comment on things people are, comment on things people do.
- "I'm sure you didn't mean that the way it sounded. Oh by the way, [good news about your life]."
- Know how to wrap things up.
- Send a thank you note.
- If people are assholes, it's more like there's a problem with them, not you. The last time you were rude, you were probably pissed off.
- Do not engage with crazy. It's just not worth it.
- *Accept that in the deepest part of your heart, that just because you are right or have the upper moral hand does not mean you'll win.*
- Deal with line-cutters as though they were sweet people who just need some gentle correction. Ninety percent: "Glad we've cleared this up!" and ten percent: "Seriously, fucker. Get to the end of the line."
- To reduce everyday shambles:
  - Deodorant/charger at home, at work, and in the car.
  - Things that must not be lost.
  - Get online banking.
  - Be on time to things.
  - Call and email people back promptly.

## Get a Job

- If you are the employee who shoes up on time without fuss, doesn't cause drama, and quietly but competently does the job you're paid for, then you will always be sought after.
- The first job will not be glamorous, lucrative or fun. No job is beneath you. "Get on your grind and get it."
- Accept the idea of networking. Conferences are nothing but networking. You can and should ask your homies if they are willing to tag you along with on networking opportunities.
- "Hey, it was so nice to meet you. Do you have a card on you? Thanks, here's mine!"
- Before having coffee: brush up on their work and what they have done.
- Go on informational interviews near and far. "Going to be in town for a few days, and I've love to stop by and introduce myself." This implies that you are business-minded and a person who zips efficiently through airports and car rental counters en route to global domination.
- If you wouldn't show or tell your mom, boss, and ex-boyfriend, don't put it on Facebook.
- Customizing resume: don't use the same wording that you do in the job description.
- Send a follow-up email after you send in your application.
- Show up looking and sounding smart. They have to be left trembling after the presence of such awesome competence.
- Don't talk about how great this job will be for you, talk about how great you are for the job.
- Don't bad-mouth any past employers. Don't bad-mouth any current employers. Don't bad-mouth anyone.
- Ask questions--this is a place you will spend forty or more hours per week. What does an average day look like for someone in this job? What kind of person would be most successful in this position? What makes your company culture unique? Anything you'd like to share with me about that job that we haven't covered yet?
- Negotiating only works if you can demonstrate your value, so be sure to figure this out ahead of time.
- If you show up looking spiffy on casual Fridays, then everyone else just looks kind of rumply by comparison.
- At your desk:
  - Deodorant.
  - Hem tape/sewing kit.
  - Lint roller.
  - Pain reliever.
  - Snacks.
  - Disinfecting wipes.
  - Hand sanitizer.
  - Quarters.
  - Travel toothbrush and toothpaste.
  - Tissues.
  - Mint.
  - Label maker.
- Don't verbally undermine yourself.
- You can only call in fake-sick one day a year.
- Don't just be likeable, be a good co-worker.
- Generally, professional-type jobs should last a year, minimum.
- Let people in your network know that you're looking.

## Money

- Ignoring money issues won't make them go away.
- Budget: Know exactly how much money you have coming in.
- Know what you are spending money on.
- Take a hard look at the things you do not need to be spending money on.
- Discretionary money per day.
- Think of shopping like drinking. Are you shopping and buying things to make yourself happier, to quiet your sadness? Are you doing it despite consequences?
- Anti-shopping mantra, and do not window-shop as though that's a real thing.
- Before buying something, leave the store first.
- Get what you came for.
- Online tax-filing websites.

## Maintenance

- Cars: Find a mechanic who you love and who will realistically not rob you.
- Used car: start it, smoke out the tailpipe, drive it to a fast speed, make sure it shifts, park, then check if anything's dripping.
- Take to a mechanic to just check the car out.
- Do not skip oil changes.
- Get scheduled maintenance every 30k miles.
  - Wheel is shaking: Probably a tire problem. Hard to steer if busted front tire, driving mushy if back wheel.
  - Thumping/jerking when you step on the brake: new brake.
  - Clunking when you are going straight: front axle is bad.
  - Hearing a backfire when accelerating: spark plug is bad.
- New tires: If the tread has worn down to less than 1/16th of an inch.
- Clothing:
  - Liquid laundry detergent.
  - Stain remover.
  - Mesh garment bag.
  - Non-wire hangers.
  - Steamer.
  - Basic but not cheap iron.
- Let your deodorant dry before putting on clothing.
- Wash using cold water.
- Hand-washing: fill a sink with cold water, than add washing detergent. Put your stuff inside and swish every now and then.
- Hair spray to remove food or grease stains. Vinegar to get rid of laundry odors.
- Bleach: use it on whites, on whites only. If you are wearing white, you must commit to it.
- Before you write off something as ruined, take it to the dry cleaners.
- Easy indoor plants:
  - Succulents
  - Small cacti
  - Sago palm
  - African violets
  - Ficus trees
  - Philodendron
  - Spider plants
- Stick your finger in the pot, if you can still feel moisture, you probably don't need any more water yet.
- If the soil is very dry and the water just runs out of the bottom of the pot, place a bowl or plate under it and add water. This allows the dry soil to rehydrate, and your plant will soak up the water from the bottom.

### Body

- Anything that tastes really good--think twice about.
- Shop around the edge of the grocery store: fruits, vegetables, meats, and a few carbohydrates.
- Consider taking vitamins and probiotics daily.

## Friends and Neighbors

- Assess honestly your own friendship needs and wants.
- Decide that you are going to have an amazing group of friends. You want a group of friends that's smart and interesting and engaging, that does fun stuff, and I'm going to find a way to make this happen.
- Go to places that have the kinds of people you want to be friends with, and ask them on a friend-date if they're vaguely promising.
- If you like them, announce your intention to become friends. "You're awesome, we should be friends!"
- Find friends through your other friends.
- If you and your friends all want to expand your social circle, you can make a dinner party where everyone has to invite someone new.
- Be nice to new people.
- Find an older friend. There are just lots of things someone who is twenty-seven knows, and even more things for someone who is thirty two.
- Spend thirty seconds reaching out to someone rather than ruing the lost friendship.
- Long-distance friends don't require a lot, but they do require some.
- Be a fun-thing initiator.
- Tell people you love why you love them.
- Monitor your friendships like you do romantic relationships. Check if a friendship has run its course and if a person a toxic presence in your life.
- Do not treat your friends like your unpaid life coaches.
- Friends can and should be there for each other, but your friend can't be your psychiatrist, and it's not fair to ask them to be.
- Remember that your new love interest is only moderately interesting to your friends.
- Tell your friends the important things.
- Neighbors
  - The first time you see a new neighbor, introduce yourself.
  - Don't make the first step the landlord. Give the offender the benefit of the doubt. "I just want to let you know that your music is pretty loud and I was hoping you could turn it down.
- Be a good neighbor generally.
- If there is an issue with a roommate, discuss it calmly.
- If you find yourself dreading your at-home hours, then consider whether the living situation is right for you.

## Love

- Accept that heartbreak is inevitable, and realize that the only way to be a full human being is to experience it at least once.
- Don't casually hurt people who love you, even if you don't love them. This is not good for your soul.
- You need to have enough dignity and self-worth to walk away from something that is bad for you.
- Be cool about being single. The happy ones don't go spend a bunch of time telling everyone how great it is.
- Learn to enjoy your own company. The valid solution to sad singleness is not an end to the singleness, it's an end to the sadness. Buck up and learn to enjoy the pleasure of your own company.
- If you're interested in someone, and you think they're interested in you, the only way to find out is to ask them out. Then you'll have your answer. Do not be ambiguous, because asking someone out clears up any remaining ambiguity.
- Don't be friends with someone you're romantically interested in, hopefully they'll change their mind.
- Don't be unkind to someone because they're interested in you. Not false hope, be flattered, be kind, but don't lead them on.
- Friends with Benefits.
  - You genuinely like them as a person.
  - You have no desire to date them.
  - They have no desire to date you.
  - This doesn't hurt anyone's feelings.
- No need to be a walk of shame, it can just be a walk.
- If hooking up makes you feel bad about yourself, don't hook up.
- Don't date someone you're not crazy about, or who isn't crazy about you.
-
