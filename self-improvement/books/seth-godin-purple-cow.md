# Purple Cow

- The new P is "Purple Cow".
- Ads:
  - Before ads, word of mouth.
  - During: mass media, advertise direct to consumer.
  - After: we're too busy to pay attention to ads, but we're desperate to find good stuff that solves our problems.

- The Death of the TV-Industrial Complex.
  - TV ads: Profit, ads, distribute, sell more ads!
- Old rule: create safe ordinary products and combine them with great marketing. The new rule: create remarkable products that the right people seek out.
- TV-Industrial Complex Products: Barbie, Honeywell, McDonalds, Marlboro, Captain Crunch.
- Purple Cow Products: Starbucks, Magic cards, Linux, Outback Steakhouse.

- **Instead of trying to use your technology and expertise to make a better product for your users' standard behavior, experiment with inviting the users to change their behavior to make the product work dramatically better.**

- No one is going to eagerly adapt to your product. The vast majority of consumers are happy, stuck, and sold on what they've got.
- You must design a product that is remarkable enough to attract the early adopters, but is flexible enough and attractive enough that those adopters will have an easy time spreading the idea to the rest of the curve.
- Ex: digital cameras. When their quality and their usability improved, they were rewarded with increased sales.

## Ideas that Spread, Win

  - How often will people sneeze it to their friends?
  - How reputable are the people most likely to promote your idea?
