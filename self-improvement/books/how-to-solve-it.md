# How to Solve It

- Note: A bit too mathematical, I think I know most of these anyway.

## Part I. In the Classroom

### Purpose

1. **Helping the student.** The student should acquire as much experience of independent work as possible. Left alone = no progress, too much help = nothing is left.
  - Teacher should put himself in the position of the student.
2. **Questions, recommendations, and mental operations.**
  - We can group questions and suggestions which are helpful in discussing problems with students.
3. **Generality.**
4. **Common sense.**
5. **Teacher and student.**
  - Two aims to which the teacher may have a view when addressing to his students a suggestion: solve the problem, and develop the student's ability.
  - Solving problems can be practiced. Trying to swim, you imitate what other people do with their hands and feet to keep their heads above water.
   - Give problems that must instill some interest for problems into their minds and give them plenty of opportunity for imitation and practice.
6. **Four phases.**
  - Understand the problem.
  - See how the items are connected.
  - Carry out the plan.
  - Look back at the completed solution, review/discuss.


13. **Looking back.**
  - By looking back, by reconsidering and reexamining the result, they could consolidate their knowledge and develop their ability to solve problems.

## Part II. How to Solve It, a Dialogue

- Where should I start, what can I do, what can I gain by doing so?
- What could I perceive, how can an idea be helpful, and what can I do with an incomplete idea?
- What can I gain by doing so again?

### Carrying Out the Plan

- Principal means of varying a problem: Generalization, specialization, analogy, decomposing, recombining.
- The math experience of the student is incomplete if he never had an opportunity to solve a problem invented by himself.
- Better if we can formally prove that something is correct.
- Could we restate the problem?
- Possibly reconstructions of the problem:
  - Keep the unknown and change the rest.
  - Keep the data and change the rest.
  - Change both.
