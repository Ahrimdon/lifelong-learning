# Linchpin

- We trade out genius and artistry for apparent stability.
- Picasso, on modern art: "What do you think reality looks like?" He then tells the man who shows the photograph of his wife that "She's very small, and flat, too."
- "Stop settling for what's good enough and start creating art that matters. Stop asking what's in it for you and start giving gifts that change people. Then, and only then, will you have achieved your potential."
- Where does average come from?
  - You've been brainwashed by school and by the system into believing that your job is to do your job and follow instructions.
  - Everyone has a little voice inside of their head that's angry and afraid. The resistance (your lizard brain) wants you to be average and safe.
  - You were trained to be a cog, but you can train yourself to matter, be a linchpin.
- **Do not internalize the industrial model. You are not one of the myriad of interchangeable pieces, but a unique human being, and if you've got something to say, say it, and think well of yourself while you're learning to say it better.** David Manet

## The New World of Work

- Wealth of Nations: Break the production of goods into tiny tasks, tasks that can be undertaken by low-paid people following simple instructions.
- What factory workers want: compliant, low-paid, replaceable cogs to run their machines.
- We need original people and people who care.
- Linchpin = the one person who can bring it together and make a difference.
- In the factory era, you wanted to have a lot of workers who were replaceable. So we built giant organizations with easily replaceable laborers.
- ***The Rule of Ordinary People, from the E-Myth Revisited:*** The model will be operated by people with the lowest possible level of skill.If your model depends on highly skilled people, it's going to be impossible to replicate.
- ***The Law of the Mechanical Turk.*** Any project, if broken down into sufficiently small, predictable parts, can be accomplished for awfully close to free.
  - Wikipedia vs Encyclopedia Britannica.
  - Do you want to be a Mechanical Turk?
- The system was never about obedience. It was only a few generations ago when it started. Having a factory job wasn't a natural state. We've been brainwashed to believe that accepting the hierarchy and lack of responsibility that come with a factory job is the only way.
- Success means being an artist. In fact, history is now written by artists while factory workers struggle.
- ***The Myth of the White-Collar Job.***
  - If we can measure it, we can do it faster.
  - If we can put it in a manual, we can outsource it.
  - If we can outsource it, we can get it cheaper.
- The old layers: Bourgeoisie and proletariat. New layer: linchpin.
  - They are not proles, but they are also not princes or barons of industry.
  - Management wins when it can get the most work for the least pay, and the more controlled the output, the better.
- There are fewer and fewer good jobs where you can get paid merely for showing up, instead organizations pay for people who make a difference and are shedding everyone else.
- The Internet has raised the bar because it's so easy for word to spread about great stuff. The market will find great stuff.
- The average employee subsidizes the mediocre, and the above average get screwed.

### Thinking About Your Choice

- If you want a job where it's okay to follow the rules, don't be surprised if you get a job where following the rules is all you get to do.
- We want to bring the best programmers in the world, so we can create tons of jobs for local talent.
- Would your career advance if you could figure out a way to do an even better job of following your boss's instructions? Or would you be more successful if you were more artistic, motivated, aware, and genuine?

## Indoctrination: How We Got Here

- In the 1890s, the typical teenager owned only a few items of clothing, virtually no media, and owned no cosmetics. You don't really need a lot of things.
- Keeping up with the Joneses isn't really a genetic predisposition, it's an invented need.
- The only way linchpins differ from a mediocre rule-follower is that they never bought into this self-limiting line of thought. The distinction is one of attitude, not learning.
- Charm + Perseverance + Talent = Linchpin.
- Being Good at School: Good if you want to do school forever.
- The best schools are often selectors of people with attitude and talent.
- What they should teach in school:
  - Solve interesting problems. Doing by rote is a total waste of time.
  - Lead. This is a skill, not a gift.

## Becoming the Linchpin

- Ex: An employee who can accurately see the truth, understand the situation, and understand the potential outcomes of decisions. And now imagining that this person is also able to make something happen.
- The law of linchpin leverage: The more value you create in your job, the fewer clock minutes of labor you actually spend creating that value. Brilliant authors/engineers are brilliant only in tiny bursts. The rest of the time time, they're doing work that almost any trained person could do.
- It takes a lot of tinkering or low-level work or domain knowledge for that brilliance to be evoked, but from the outside, it appears that the art is created in a moment, not in tiny increments.
- You don't have to be the one moving bricks as long as there's someone cheaper and more replaceable you can hire to do the moving. If you've got no choice but to move the bricks, think about optimizing it.
- ***People who tell you that they don't have any good ideas are selling themselves short. They don't have ideas that are valued because they're not investing in their art.*** People who tell you that "I could pain a painting like that" are missing the point. The craft is easy, but it's the art and the insight and the bravery of value creation that are rewarded.
- Depth of knowledge alone is not enough, you need to combine it with good judgment.
- You need knowledge when:
  - When the knowledge is needed on a moment's notice and bringing in an outside source is too risky or time consuming.
  - When the knowledge is needed on a constant basis and the cost of brining in an outside source is too high.
  - When depth of knowledge is also involved in decision making, and internal credibility and organizational knowledge go hand in hand with knowing the right answer.
- ***Expertise gives you enough insight to reinvent what everyone else assumes is the truth.*** It's far more likely that you will design a great Web site or direct a powerful movie or lead a breakthrough product development if you understand the status quo better than anyone else.
- ***Emotional labor: Arlie Hochschild, Managed Heart.*** The management of feeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display. Its the work you do with your feelings, not your body.
  - This is the hard work of making art, producing generosity, and exposing creativity. Working without a map involved both vision and the willingness to do something about what you see.
  - Emotional labor is what you get paid to do.
- You get paid to go to work and do something of value. But your job is also a platform for generosity, for expression, for art.
  - Every interaction you have with a coworker or customer is an opportunity to practice the art of interaction. Every product you make represents an opportunity to design something that has never been designed, to create an interaction unlike any other.
- Linchpins like the lack of structure and find a new path, one that works.
- The Art of Possibility, Ben Zander: How Ben just gives everyone an A. Or you can just give yourself a D, if you hate structure and expectation and the status quo.
- Troubleshooters are the best: If you could describe the steps needed to shoot trouble, there wouldn't be trouble in the first place, right? Troubleshooting is an art, and it's a gift from the troubleshooter to the person in trouble.
- Charles Krulak: "In the age of always-on cameras, cell phones, and social networks, the lowly corporal in the field would have far more leverage and impact than ever before."
  - ***Krulak's law: The closer you get to the front, the more power you have over the brand.***
  - Organizations that can bring humanity and flexibility to their interactions with other human beings will thrive.
- Luxury goods in France? Let other countries find the raw materials, the French would fashion it, brand it, and sell it back to them as high-priced goods.
- Fearless: Be unafraid of things that one shouldn't be afraid of. Reckless: rushing into places that only a fool would go.
- On being tired: Fatigue is there, but some people understand that putting it aside was the single most important factor in succeeding.
  - Where do you put there fear? Feel it, acknowledge it, then proceed.
- On being perfect: I don't really care. In your mind, you see 20 years of exploits and 1 typo in the resume, do you mention the typo?
- Art is never defect-free.
- Instead of a resume, you can have:
  - A blog that is so compelling and insightful that people have no choice but to follow up?
  - A project that an employer can see or touch?
  - A reputation that precedes you?
- The great jobs aren't filled by people mailing in resumes.
- Projects are the new resumes. Change your things!
- Find a company that understands the value of the linchpin.
- Thirty-eight factors that motivated them to do their best:
  - Challenge and responsibility
  - Flexibility
  - A stable work environment
  - Money
  - Professional development
  - Peer recognition
  - Stimulating colleagues and bosses
  - Exciting job content
  - Organizational culture
  - Location and community
- "I don't want a job that a non-linchpin could get."

## Is It Possible to Do Hard Work in a Cubicle?

- The opportunity doesn't feel necessarily like an opportunity. Volunteering to do emotional labor is a difficult choice.
- The act of giving someone a smile, connecting to a human
