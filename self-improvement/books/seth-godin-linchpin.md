# Linchpin

- We trade out genius and artistry for apparent stability.
- Picasso, on modern art: "What do you think reality looks like?" He then tells the man who shows the photograph of his wife that "She's very small, and flat, too."
- "Stop settling for what's good enough and start creating art that matters. Stop asking what's in it for you and start giving gifts that change people. Then, and only then, will you have achieved your potential."
- Where does average come from?
  - You've been brainwashed by school and by the system into believing that your job is to do your job and follow instructions.
  - Everyone has a little voice inside of their head that's angry and afraid. The resistance (your lizard brain) wants you to be average and safe.
  - You were trained to be a cog, but you can train yourself to matter, be a linchpin.
- **Do not internalize the industrial model. You are not one of the myriad of interchangeable pieces, but a unique human being, and if you've got something to say, say it, and think well of yourself while you're learning to say it better.** David Manet

## The New World of Work

- Wealth of Nations: Break the production of goods into tiny tasks, tasks that can be undertaken by low-paid people following simple instructions.
- What factory workers want: compliant, low-paid, replaceable cogs to run their machines.
- We need original people and people who care.
- Linchpin = the one person who can bring it together and make a difference.
- In the factory era, you wanted to have a lot of workers who were replaceable. So we built giant organizations with easily replaceable laborers.
- ***The Rule of Ordinary People, from the E-Myth Revisited:*** The model will be operated by people with the lowest possible level of skill.If your model depends on highly skilled people, it's going to be impossible to replicate.
- ***The Law of the Mechanical Turk.*** Any project, if broken down into sufficiently small, predictable parts, can be accomplished for awfully close to free.
  - Wikipedia vs Encyclopedia Britannica.
  - Do you want to be a Mechanical Turk?
- The system was never about obedience. It was only a few generations ago when it started. Having a factory job wasn't a natural state. We've been brainwashed to believe that accepting the hierarchy and lack of responsibility that come with a factory job is the only way.
- Success means being an artist. In fact, history is now written by artists while factory workers struggle.
- ***The Myth of the White-Collar Job.***
  - If we can measure it, we can do it faster.
  - If we can put it in a manual, we can outsource it.
  - If we can outsource it, we can get it cheaper.
- The old layers: Bourgeoisie and proletariat. New layer: linchpin.
  - They are not proles, but they are also not princes or barons of industry.
  - Management wins when it can get the most work for the least pay, and the more controlled the output, the better.
- There are fewer and fewer good jobs where you can get paid merely for showing up, instead organizations pay for people who make a difference and are shedding everyone else.
- The Internet has raised the bar because it's so easy for word to spread about great stuff. The market will find great stuff.
- The average employee subsidizes the mediocre, and the above average get screwed.

### Thinking About Your Choice

- If you want a job where it's okay to follow the rules, don't be surprised if you get a job where following the rules is all you get to do.
- We want to bring the best programmers in the world, so we can create tons of jobs for local talent.
- Would your career advance if you could figure out a way to do an even better job of following your boss's instructions? Or would you be more successful if you were more artistic, motivated, aware, and genuine?

## Indoctrination: How We Got Here

- In the 1890s, the typical teenager owned only a few items of clothing, virtually no media, and owned no cosmetics. You don't really need a lot of things.
- Keeping up with the Joneses isn't really a genetic predisposition, it's an invented need.
- The only way linchpins differ from a mediocre rule-follower is that they never bought into this self-limiting line of thought. The distinction is one of attitude, not learning.
- Charm + Perseverance + Talent = Linchpin.
- Being Good at School: Good if you want to do school forever.
- The best schools are often selectors of people with attitude and talent.
- What they should teach in school:
  - Solve interesting problems. Doing by rote is a total waste of time.
  - Lead. This is a skill, not a gift.

## Becoming the Linchpin

- Ex: An employee who can accurately see the truth, understand the situation, and understand the potential outcomes of decisions. And now imaging that this person is also able to make something happen.
