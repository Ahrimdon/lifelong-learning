## Crushing It

- Posting a free teaching class on wine in his alma mater, and through Instagram, he was able to market his thing.
- If you're earning what you need to live the life you want and loving every day of it, you're crushing it.

### 1: The Path is All Yours

- Instagram: 1K followers = 5K per year with 2 posts per week, 10K followers = 20K per year.
- There is room for many, many experts and personalities to create a lucrative, sustainable ecosystem that promotes and grows their business/side hustles.
- Personal brand = not just the thing you did, but the person behind it.
- ***It's a matter of survival to think beyond your current successes and constantly look for ways to create new ones so that you're never limited to any one platform or even one topic. How do you do that? By creating a personal brand so powerful that it transcends platforms, products, and your passion.***
- A strong personal brand is your ticket to complete personal and professional freedom.
- The Internet is the ultimate middleman, allowing every industry to go direct-to-consumer.
- "What's Inside?" show: Dan Markham is a sales rep who practiced and practiced for sales pitches. He knew that he was just building skills for entrepreneurship.
- Savvy Sexy Social: "To end the misery that small businesses were going through."

### 2: What Still Matters

- ***Intent, authenticity, passion, patience, speed, work, and attention.***

#### Intent

- To share your knowledge? To help people? To build something that leaves a legacy? To make a good income to give yourself and your family financial security and breathing room? To have fun with a creative outlet? To create community?
- The pinnacle of entrepreneurship: a commitment to service, a desire to provide value, and a love of teaching.
- Solid content, real value, and they probably didn't start out as the most knowledgeable, but they had earnestness, honesty, and humor.
- Every day, improve your podcasts, photos, videos, blog posts. Draw your audience back again and again. Give, give, give, and give some more. If a product stinks, even free won't make up for your customers' disappointment. No one comes back for products or advice that doesn't work.
- I have to believe that they are 51% altruistic and only 49% selfish.
- Lewis Howes: Just connecting with local leaders, then he increased his earnings by: door charge, commission on food for the event, and passionate about teaching. Gary V: never asked for a job, he just connected people. 15-16 hour days. He then went into other bars, asked the least busy days, and charged more for those days. Eventually, he got to School of Greatness.

#### Authenticity

- On being real: even if people don't like me, few doubt that I'm for real.
  - When you don't give a shit, you have complete freedom to do and say what you want.
  - You care for other people's opinion, so you spend some time responding to skeptics to see where you're coming from.
  - Respecting the audience. I believe in people's intuition, and I believe that most are very good at sniffing out hypocrisy and opportunism.
- Lauryn Evarts, The Skinny Confidential: "Photos from 2-3, bartend from 4-12, write blog post from 12-2, wake up, teach Barre, teach Pilates, go to school, rinse and repeat. No money for two-and-a-half years. On getting brands: they actually have to be things that she uses. "Everyone says put yourself out there, be your authentic self, but when your authentic self is not what they like, they talk back."

#### Passion

- Story tell. Being authentic: being the first president of a musical instrument company who did his own product demos.
- Go deep, not wide. Content that brought value, not numbers.

#### Patience

- Eat shit for as long as you have to. Be a bigger man or woman than everyone around you, meaning the customer is always right.

#### Speed

- Micro speed: be constantly in do mode. If I make a mistake, in my mind, it's over.
- It's about deploying ungodly amounts of work. The only thing you have time for is your family. Modern-day family business is doing work with your family.
- You have to decide how you're going to spend your time. First, block off the hours you must spend on your obligations.
- Do things. Create content daily. Business development daily. Meet people who can get you awareness, distribution, or sales, somehow close to your goals. Take these actions twelve, fifteen hours per day. Sleep. Just make every minute of the other parts count.
- Crushing it is about LIVING ON YOUR OWN TERMS, EQUALLY SATISFIED WITH YOUR INCOME AND YOUR LIFE.
- Whatever energy you put into something will manifest itself in equal amounts when it comes out.

#### Content

- High-quality microcontent. You need different types of content for different types of platforms. Figuring out contexts of things: Twitter for news, Facebook for friends, Snapchat for entertainment, Youtube for some long-form video.
- Document, don't create. You can make the learning process part of your content. The learning process should be your content. It's not a problem if you've got more passion than expertise.
- Think of yourself as the star of this show and the production company.
- You can make your daily life interesting and new in the right hands.
- Documenting = preparing for how people will watch you ten years from now.
- Don't fake it. It's OK to be a novice, it's not OK to be manipulative. It's exciting to see someone strategically come into their professional own. Embrace your newness because it can give you an advantage. You can then say at some point, "I told you so."
- If we document, we can completely destroy the myth of the overnight success. As long as you know this content is valuable, and you know it's true, don't judge it.
- Work but don't be a perfectionist. Perfection doesn't exist, it's totally subjective.
- Rich Rolls: E-book on the website for nine dollars = paid mortgage. Write guest blog posts, appear on any podcasts that would give him a slot, speaking in front of an audience.

### 4: Whats Stopping You?

- Brand: Name of the thing, not the name of the person.
- Fear of wasting time: You can always go back to the practical world in twenty-four months if you stink or you hate what you're doing.
- You won't waste time on the business if you were going to be spending time with Game of Thrones or some video games, how can you say it was wasted?
- Everyone looks like an ass when trying something new. ***Everyone's an ass until they're a pioneer.***

### 5: The Only Thing You Need To Give Yourself To Crush It

- Passing the LEED exam: ebook: compilation of the things on the site, but better organized and easier to read, complete with charts.
- Coolest email: Getting $19.99 for the ebook minus the fee to Paypal.
- Became the LEED expert because no one else was providing the help people were seeking.
- Gary: Responding to a 1-star comment/chat with them on Skype.
- Go deep, go niche, and provide real value in the form of entertainment or information.

### 6: First, Do This

- Create a Facebook business page.

### 7: Get Discovered

- Breakthroughs:
  - Hashtags. Unbelievably long grind.
  - Direct messaging. Unbelievably long grind.
  - This will take years, not months.
- Ex: if you sit with a person beside you (complete stranger) who is chatting re: programming, wouldn't you help them? Also, a "check out my website, maybe we can work together."
- To get attention:
  - Offering free pizza from your shop for six months.
  - Graphic designer: Offering to make 600 custom filters.

### 8: `Musical.ly`

### 9: Snapchat

### 10: Twitter

- Twitter is the water cooler of society. Twitter is in a really tricky spot: it continues to remain the only pure social network, a place where people interact with content, with each other, and with events.
- This is the place to listen, react, and hijack.
- Discipline: backing up your ambitions with your actions.
- Twitter can give you a chance to lure and lasso people into your orbit in a way that no other platform does.
- Because it was built to be a conversation platform, Twitter is the place to start biz dev opportunities/collaborations as you grow your brand.
- Retweets can create awareness.
- Twitter allows you to amplify your voice and your brand.

### YouTube

- Aside from beauty bloggers, body builders, and pop idols (those industries where looks really matter), everyone on Youtube looks ordinary.
- ***Document instead of create.***
- I just thought filming a wine review show was a good idea, I just did it.
- "You've got to be passionate about things other than wine."
- Video optimizations
  - Titles. Short/concise, emotionally driven, and/or keyword optimized? Viewable on mobile?
  - Descriptions: Keyword optimized? Links to similar videos/playlists in the description? Links to social media accounts?
  - Tags: At least 10 tags. Figure out high tag values.
  - Thumbnails: Text?
  - Youtube Cards.
- Channel optimizations
  - Banner.
  - About section: keyword optimized?
  - Custom playlist?
  - Channel trailer: On the landing page.

### 12: Facebook

- Flexible: written content, videos, pictures, SoundCloud.

### 13: Instagram

- Make sure your Instagram is full of incredible content, the best you can make.
- More people are about to come see what you're about.
- Search relevant keywords.
- Click on hashtags that show up.

### 14: Podcasts

- Podcasts sell time. Easier to listen to this while you check your e-mails and pay your bills.
- Entrepreneurs on Fire.

### 15: Voice-First

- Alexa.

### Conclusion

- Social media does equal business.
- Innovation makes people uncomfortable.
- We should care desperately about everything, yet not care at all about what anyone else thinks. Someone will always be trying to tear you down. Talent has little value without patience and persistence.
