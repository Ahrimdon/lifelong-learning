## Crushing It

- Posting a free teaching class on wine in his alma mater, and through Instagram, he was able to market his thing.
- If you're earning what you need to live the life you want and loving every day of it, you're crushing it.

### 1: The Path is All Yours

- Instagram: 1K followers = 5K per year with 2 posts per week, 10K followers = 20K per year.
- There is room for many, many experts and personalities to create a lucrative, sustainable ecosystem that promotes and grows their business/side hustles.
- Personal brand = not just the thing you did, but the person behind it.
- ***It's a matter of survival to think beyond your current successes and constantly look for ways to create new ones so that you're never limited to any one platform or even one topic. How do you do that? By creating a personal brand so powerful that it transcends platforms, products, and your passion.***
- A strong personal brand is your ticket to complete personal and professional freedom.
- The Internet is the ultimate middleman, allowing every industry to go direct-to-consumer.
- "What's Inside?" show: Dan Markham is a sales rep who practiced and practiced for sales pitches. He knew that he was just building skills for entrepreneurship.
- Savvy Sexy Social: "To end the misery that small businesses were going through."

### 2: What Still Matters

- ***Intent, authenticity, passion, patience, speed, work, and attention.***

#### Intent

- To share your knowledge? To help people? To build something that leaves a legacy? To make a good income to give yourself and your family financial security and breathing room? To have fun with a creative outlet? To create community?
- The pinnacle of entrepreneurship: a commitment to service, a desire to provide value, and a love of teaching.
- Solid content, real value, and they probably didn't start out as the most knowledgeable, but they had earnestness, honesty, and humor.
- Every day, improve your podcasts, photos, videos, blog posts. Draw your audience back again and again. Give, give, give, and give some more. If a product stinks, even free won't make up for your customers' disappointment. No one comes back for products or advice that doesn't work.
- I have to believe that they are 51% altruistic and only 49% selfish.
- Lewis Howes: Just connecting with local leaders, then he increased his earnings by: door charge, commission on food for the event, and passionate about teaching. Gary V: never asked for a job, he just connected people. 15-16 hour days. He then went into other bars, asked the least busy days, and charged more for those days. Eventually, he got to School of Greatness.

#### Authenticity

- On being real: even if people don't like me, few doubt that I'm for real.
  - When you don't give a shit, you have complete freedom to do and say what you want.
  - You care for other people's opinion, so you spend some time responding to skeptics to see where you're coming from.
  - Respecting the audience. I believe in people's intuition, and I believe that most are very good at sniffing out hypocrisy and opportunism.
- Lauryn Evarts, The Skinny Confidential: "Photos from 2-3, bartend from 4-12, write blog post from 12-2, wake up, teach Barre, teach Pilates, go to school, rinse and repeat. No money for two-and-a-half years. On getting brands: they actually have to be things that she uses. "Everyone says put yourself out there, be your authentic self, but when your authentic self is not what they like, they talk back."

#### Passion

- Story tell. Being authentic: being the first president of a musical instrument company who did his own product demos.
- Go deep, not wide. Content that brought value, not numbers.

#### Patience

- Eat shit for as long as you have to. Be a bigger man or woman than everyone around you, meaning the customer is always right.

#### Speed

- Micro speed: be constantly in do mode. If I make a mistake, in my mind, it's over.
- It's about deploying ungodly amounts of work. The only thing you have time for is your family. Modern-day family business is doing work with your family.
- You have to decide how you're going to spend your time. First, block off the hours you must spend on your obligations.
