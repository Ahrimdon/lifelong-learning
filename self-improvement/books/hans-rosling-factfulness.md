# Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong and Why Things Are Better Than You Think

- The vast majority of the world's population lives somewhere in the middle of the income scale. They are not living in poverty. Girls go to school, children get vaccinated, they live in two-child families, and they want to go abroad on holiday. Step-by-step, the world is improving.
- The human brain is hard-wired by instincts: we like gossip and dramatic stories and crave sugar and fat. The last attempt

# The Gap Instinct

- Mega misconception: "The world is divided in two, rich and poor."
- Them vs us: developing and developed world. Really not that much of a gap between us and them in 2017.
- 60% of girls finish primary school in low-income countries. Only 9% of people live in really poor countries.
- The gap instinct: human beings have a dramatic instinct toward binary thinking, a basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups.
- Recognize that when a story talks about a gap, this presents a polarized version of reality. Usually, the majority is right there in the middle, where the gap is supposed to be.
  - Majority between comparisons of averages.
  - Beware comparisons of extremes.
  - Looking from the top down distorts the view.

# The Negativity Instinct

- Throughout history (1800), life expectancy was roughly 30 years old. It's because half of all babies born died throughout childhood, and the other half died between the ages of 50 and 70.
- The goal of higher income is not just bigger piles of money, the goal of longer lives is not just extra time. The ultimate goal is to have the freedom to do what we want.
- The news constantly alerts us to bad events in the present. Also, people are feeling, not thinking, when they think that the world is getting worse.
- Controlling negativity:
  - Things are bad, but they are better.
  - Constantly expect bad news.
  - Good news is almost never reported. So news is almost always bad.

# The Straight Line Instinct

- The world's population is growing, but growth has already started to slow down.
- When families go out of extreme poverty, they no longer need large families for child labor on the small family farm, and they no longer need extra children to serve as insurance against child morality.

# The Fear Instinct

- When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.
- Because of humans' dramatic instincts, the media must tap into them to grab our attention, and we continue to have an over dramatic worldview.
- Fears of physical harm (heights), captivity (small spaces/claustrophobia), and poison (snakes/spiders) once helped our ancestors survive.
- Terrorism only accounts for 0.05% of all deaths in the world in 2016.
- Risk = danger * exposure.

# The Size Instinct

- "In the deepest poverty you should never do anything perfectly. If you do, you are stealing resources from where they can be better used."
- Instinct: you misjudge the importance of a single instance or an identifiable victim. The media is this instinct's friend.
- People on Level 4 live the safest lives in history. Many preventable risks have been eliminated.

# The Generalization Instinct

- He convinced villagers that in his Swedish tribe, they don't eat larvae, and in Norway, they do. People know that tribes exist, and that each tribe has a different custom.
- ***Everyone automatically categorizes and generalizes all the time. Unconsciously. It is not a question of being prejudiced or enlightened. Categories are necessary for us to function. They give structure to our thoughts.***
- The media is the instinct's friend. Misleading generalizations and stereotypes act as a kind of shorthand for the media, providing quick and easy ways to communicate.
- Gap instinct: divides the world into "us" and "them", and the generalization instinct makes "us" think of "them" as all the same.
- Public hospitals: people in extreme poverty have no hospitals at all. A woman living in extreme poverty gives birth on a mud floor.
- When visiting reality in other countries, and not just the backpacker cafes, you realize that generalizing from what is normal in your home environment can be useless or even dangerous.
- Question your categories: look for differences within and similarities across groups, beware of "the majority", beware of exceptional examples, assume you are not normal, beware of generalizing from one group to another.

# The Destiny Instinct

- Destiny instinct: innate characteristics determine the destinies of people, countries, religions, cultures. Things are just as they are for whatever reasons.
- Societies and cultures are not rocks. They move.
- Ex: "Africa will never catch up with Europe." "The Islamic world is fundamentally different from the Christian world."
- Macho values: These are not Asian values, African values, Muslim values, Eastern values. These are patriarchal values like those found in Sweden 60 years ago.
- Recognize that many things appear to be constant just because change is happening slowly, and remember that even small, slow changes gradually add up to big changes.
- A big idea can unite people like nothing else and allow us to build the society of our dreams. Ideology has given us democracy and public health insurance.
- Most countries that make great economic and social progress are not democracies. S Korea moved from Level 1 to Level 3 as a military dictatorship.
- A single perspective can limit your imagination, and remember that it is better to look at problems from many angles to get a more accurate understanding and find practical solutions.

# The Blame Instinct

- The blame instinct: the instinct to find a clear, simple reason for why something bad has happened.
- Instead of pointing our fingers at journalists, we should be asking: why does the media present such a distorted picture of the world?
- Distorted worldview: we are human beings with dramatic instincts. System factor to produce skewed and overdramatic views: they must compete for their consumers' attention or lose their jobs.
- When abortion is made illegal, it doesn't stop abortions from happening, but it does make abortions more dangerous and increase the risk of women dying as a result.

# The Urgency Instinct

- We should worry about:
  - A global pandemic.
  - Financial collapse: systems are too complicated.
  - World War III.
  - Climate change.
  - Extreme poverty. We are in the last mile already.
