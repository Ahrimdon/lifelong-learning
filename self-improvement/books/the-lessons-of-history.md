# The Lessons of History

# I. Hesitations

- "Most history is guessing, the rest is prejudice. The historian always oversimplifies, and hastily selects a manageable minority of facts and faces out of a crowd of souls and events.
- History is subject to geology. Climate limits us.
- Rivers draw settlers to their shores: Egypt + Nile, Mesopotamia + Tigris/Euphrates, India + Indus, China + Yellow, Italy + Tiber, Austria + Danube, Germany + Rhine, France + Rhone, Petra + oases in the desert.
- The airplane will again alter the map of civilization. England/France lose the commercial advantage of abundant coast lines, and Russia + China + Brazil can get to the air.
- Life is competition. Competition is not only the life of trade, it is the trade of life. We are greedy because our ancestors had to fight for everything to survive.
- Life is selection. We are all born unfree and unequal, subject to our physical and psychological heredity, and to the customs and traditions of our group.
  - Inequality also grows with the complexity of civilization. Hereditary inequalities breed social and artificial inequalities. Each invention makes the strong stronger, and the weak relatively weaker. 30% of the best men's combined ability would equal that of all the rest.
  - *Even when repressed, inequality grows, only the man who is below the average in economic ability desires equality, and those who are conscious of superior ability desire freedom.*
- Life must breed. Nature likes quantity. If humans are too many for the food supply, nature has: famine, pestilence, war.
  - Malthus (1798): The issuance of relief funds or supplies to the poor encouraged them to marry early and breed a lot, making the problem worse.
  - Julius Caesar offered rewards to Romans who had many children, and forbade childless women to ride in litters or wear jewelry.

# IV. Race and History

- History is color -blind, and can develop a civilization under almost any skin.
- Would any of the white "races" have done better in the climate of Africa?
- Racial antipathies have some roots in ethnic origin, but they are also generated by differences of acquired culture (language, dress, habits, morals, religion). Civilization is a cooperative product, nearly all peoples have contributed to it, it's our common heritage and debt.

# V. Character and History

- History shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind through the years.
- The poor have the same impulses as the rich, with only less opportunity or skill to implement them.
- The evolution in man has been social, rather than biological: it's mainly due to the economic, political, intellectual, and moral innovation.
- The initiative individual: the "great man" regains his place as a formative force in history.
  - Churchill's eloquence, Napoleon's tactics, Mohammed's inspiration  can be equivalent to 1000 regiments.
  - Submissive natures unite with masterful individuals to make the order and operation of a society, so the imitative majority follows the innovating minority, and this follows the originative individual.
- Intellect is vital, but can also be destructive. Conservatives who resist change are as valuable as the radical who proposes it. It's good that new ideas should be heard, but those ideas should also be objected and tried.

# VI. Morals and History

- There is a universality of moral codes. Moral codes differ because they adjust themselves to historical and environmental conditions.
- Three stages of economic history:
  - Hunting: Need to be ready to chase and fight and kill. Not sure when he can eat again. The death rate in men was higher than in women, so some men had to take several women, and every man was expected to help women to frequent pregnancy. Being brutal, greedy, and sexually ready were advantages in the struggle for existence.
  - Agriculture: Being industrious is now more important than being brave, thrift more than violence, peace more than war. Children are economic assets, birth control is immoral. The family is the unity of production under the discipline of the father and the seasons, and paternal authority had a firm economic base. Monogamy is encourages for the approximate numerical equality of the sexes.
  - Industrial: Work as individuals, individually paid, in factories built to house machines, not men. Economic maturity (the capacity so support a family) came later, and children were not longer economic assets, so marriage was delayed. Cities provide discouragement to marriage, but stimulus and facility for sex. Contraceptives = can separate intercourse from pregnancy. Education spread religious doubts, and morality lost more and more of its supernatural supports.
- Ancient Greece/Rome, Renaissance Italy: homosexuality. Assyria, French Montaigne: prostitution. Nineveh: gambling.
- *The history that is written is different from the history that was really lived: the historian records the exceptional because it is interesting.* Behind the facade of war and politics, misfortune and poverty, adultery and divorce, murder and suicide were millions of orderly homes, devoted marriages.
- Civilizations decay quite leisurely.

# VII. Religion and History

- "It was fear that made the gods": fear of hidden forces in the earth, rivers, oceans, trees, winds, and sky. Religion became the worship of these forces through offering, sacrifice, incantation, and prayer.
- The local code of the morals and laws had been dictated by the gods.
- The masses of mankind desire a religion rich in miracle, mystery, and myth.
- The replacement of Christian with secular institutions is the culminating and critical result of the Industrial Revolution.
