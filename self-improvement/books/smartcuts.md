## Smartcuts: The Breakthrough Power of Lateral Thinking

- Formal education, in many cases, is so slow or out-of-date that venture capitalists pay bright people to skip school and start Internet companies.
- Problem with the "frail old woman", "friend", and "romantic interest."
- Ben Franklin: a lateral solution to the unfairness of present convention. Frank Abegnale: a con, and he paid for it.
- Hanging around overachieving kids: you can't hang around these people without being inspired.
- "Hacker thinking": Used to shorten the path to success. Once they've shortened their path, overachievers tend to look for ways to do more with their effort.
- Leverage: the achiever's approach to getting more bang for the proverbial buck.
- Good fortune and talent are both ingredients to success, but like any recipe, they can be substituted with clever alternatives.

### Shorten

- American presidents tend to be younger than American Senators.
- Just over half of the presidents were ever congressmen at all.
- It's like each invented his own ladder.
- "Bigger or Better": trading a toothpick for something that is bigger and better.
- *The players eliminated resistance by breaking the big challenge, into a series of easier, repeatable challenges.*
- A series of wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistances to subsequent proposals.
- Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win. Also, we trade sideways.
- Switching career ladders bypasses "dues" and accelerates the Bigger or Better cycle.
- The yardstick the public uses when judging a presidential candidate is "leadership qualities". Commanding an army, running a university, governing a state, building a political party.

### Training with Masters

- Jimmy Fallon, Justin Bieber: climbed entertainment faster than usual.
- Bieber had Usher and rising-star manager Scooter Braun.
- *Mentorship is the secret of many of the highest-profile achievers throughout history.* Socrates to Plato, and Aristotle to Alexander the Great.
- Mentors failing: 70% of family businesses fail when passed to the second generation.
- Pit crew: they plan out every possible scenario of what could go wrong during a handover and practiced each scenario until it became habit.
  - Lot of physical space between each other.
  - Overseer to check out everything and only then would the car be allowed back onto the track. Doesn't apply to the hospital scenario.
  - Technicians worked in silence.
- Informal mentoring produced a larger and more significant effect on career outcomes than formal mentoring.
- Long-term success: deep relationship between mentor and student.
- The best mentors help students to realize that the things that really matter are not the big and obvious.
- In ancient Greece, few people had access to the best mentors. At least now we have books, videos which increase our access to the great models in every category.
- The presence of an in-person mentor, or a world-class, long-distance monitor is always present in success stories.
- Louis C.K.: mimicked George Carlin's process, memorize the details of his life. Carlin has a style of telling raw, honest stories about himself--jokes that exposed Carlin's human vulnerabilities, and began telling similarly vulnerable jokes about himself.

### Rapid Feedback

- Gandhi's seven blunders: "Wealth without work. Pleasure without conscience. Knowledge without character. Commerce without morality. Science without humanity. Religion without sacrifice. Politics without principle."
- Upworthy: Looked for stories of being good.
- "Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes."
- Americans are more tolerant of business failure than people in any other country.
- Entrepreneurs who'd failed in a previous venture were not likely to do better than someone who'd never run a business in their life. But having a successful business gives you a higher chance of succeeding again.
- Watching someone else screw up: observers get better.
- There is a tendency to pin losses on external factors and wins on internal factors.
- *When doctors failed due to what they perceived as bad luck, they didn't tend to work any smarter the next time. They attributed failure in a way that made them feel as good as they could about themselves.*
- Survival mechanism--externalizing mistakes because we need to live with ourselves afterward.
- Watching others: "since it was THAT guy's fault, fellow surgeons instinctively zeroed in on the mistakes."
- Positive feedback or negative feedback? What matters is if the feedback causes the person to focus on himself rather than the task.
- Bad feedback: things that make us self-conscious.
- *Experts tended to be able to turn off the part of their egos that took legitimate feedback personally when it came to their craft, and they were confident enough to parse helpful feedback from incorrect feedback. Meanwhile novices psyched themselves out. They needed encouragement and feared failure.*
- *Tough part about negative feedback: separating ourselves from the perceived failure and turning our experiences into objective experiments. But when we do that, feedback becomes more powerful.*
- Rapid feedback, depersonalization of feedback, and lowering the stakes/pressure, so students take risks that force them to improve. Get students used to anticipating negative feedback. This is about building confidence and creating a "safe "environment where it's okay to screw up.
- Second year: putting actors in situations where they will fail small in front of the live crowds. By embracing all these tiny failures, there is no actual failure.
- Upworthy: "I want to be remembered as the kid who went down fighting, and didn't really lose." Think of 18 alternate headlines and what is the best one out of all of them.

### Leverage

- We all know people in school and work with an ability to search for the least wasteful way to learn something and level up.
- DHH :"I hate repeating myself." Hence, Rails.
- We need to teach kids to use tools that do math for us.
- Teaching kids about a programming game: some don't even know long division, but they can figure it out. Instead of forcing kids to learn code through lectures and drills and mandatory classes, she built a toy that kids actually download and play with because they want to.
- Part of the learning the discipline is learning to communicating in the language of the discipline. We want students to recognize when they encounter a math-related problem that might well be easily solvable using tools including calculators and computers.
- "Get the thinking right and the skills come for free."
- While we may need deep expertise in our industries to become innovators, we actually need only higher-order thinking and the ability to use platforms to do everything else.
- *In an age of platforms, creative problem solving is more valuable than computational skill.*
- We need a minimum level of knowledge about the way the world works, who's in it, and how things fit together. We need to know enough about statistics to call BS on propaganda. We ought to be able to identify a good deal on a dinner menu.
- We need to teach students to use devices to get knowledge.
- To truly raise an education system, every educator must be extremely educated. Students can't have one star teacher and a dozen mediocre instructors if they are to advance more quickly than average.
- "I don't think I'm that special of a programmer or a business person or a race car driver. I just know how to train." Videos of master drivers. Tire advantages, advanced racing leagues that become platforms that forced him to master the basics faster than he would have at a lower level.
- Platforms--tools and technology like games, tires, calculators, or environments like leagues/better schools. This is why most innovation comes from metropolitan areas. "Urban friction", "the creative class" turns cities into higher platforms for success-seekers.

### Waves

- "From First to Last" band: started off online, so whereas before it could reach audiences online. Each member of the band is a character and plays more than just a musician's role.
- Surfing: "it's just a matter of waiting for the right wave." Some people and companies are adept at placing themselves at the right place at the right time.
- Leaders and managers who use their gut to make decisions do so based on decades of experiences, archived and filed away.
- Intuition is the result of non-conscious pattern recognition.
- Practice is good, but we can often do just as well by deliberately looking for them.
- The intuition is that first movers enjoy an unfair advantage over their competitors.
- 47% of first movers failed, but early leaders--companies that took control of a product's market share after the first movers pioneered them--had only an 8% failure rate.
- First movers take on the burden of educating customers, setting up infrastructure, getting regulatory approvals, and making mistakes.
- Fast followers benefit from free-rider effects. The pioneers clear the way so the next guys can steal what works, learn objectively from the first movers' failures, and spend more effort elsewhere.
- Skrillex: Right place at the right time? He experimented with the Web, social networks, scream-singing, EDM--sticking his toe in different waters until he recognized incoming waves. He also tried things that didn't work (solo career as a rock singer) and was quick to shift strategies.

### Superconnectors

- What is easier, be friends with a thousand people or be friends with someone who already has a thousand friends?
- Superconnector--like a friend who knows everyone, or the mass media.
- The device that helped turned the tide of the Cuban revolution--Che Guevarra's radio transmitter.
- J.J. Abrams: known for kindness and lack of ego. Skrillex: remixed artists like Lady Gaga.
- Mint.com: Instead of getting users via ads, they made blog posts that might be voted up by bookmarking (Reddit) crowds.
- Radio Rebelde: They taught the people how to read. They became teachers and inspirations during the day, and reported the news at night.
- Better to tell the truth, small in its dimensions, than a large lie artfully embellished.
- *Giving is the timeless smartcut for harnessing superconnectors and creating serendipity.*

### Momentum

- Compare Michelle Phan with double rainbow guy.
- Pajama-rich: people who have so much money that they have nothing to prove to anyone.
- "What do you do after walking on the moon?" became a speed bump. When there's no forward momentum in our careers, we get depressed.
- Workers need to experience lots of tiny wins.
- Momentum/future success--they will take bigger bets on companies with fast-growing user bases even if the companies are bleeding money.
- Michelle Phan: Bob-Ross style (quiet voice) makeovers, uploaded videos on Thursday since they stay on the front page for 2 days and weekends don't count. She also had a big backlog of content. She spent years honing her craft, stealing from Bob Ross, studying Youtube's homepage, connecting with media companies and the fans of famous pop icons.

### Simplicity

- Premature babies: born with too little fat, and so if they died, it was usually because they were too cold.
- Embrace: a sleeping bag for babies.
- *Innovation: doing something differently, rather than creating something from nothing (invention) or doing the same thing better (improvement).*
- The key feature of disruptively innovative products is cost savings. But the key ingredient behind the scenes of every disruptive product is simplification. E-mail is not just cheaper, but simpler than postal mail. USB is not just less expensive, but also simpler to use, and cloud is even simpler than flash.
- The Wirecutter: kickback after you checked what's the best so-and-so to buy.
- Often, the thing holding us back from success is our inability to say no. We can't keep the momentum going if we can't let go of the ring behind us as we swing forward.
- Sherlock Holmes: "What is the purpose of knowing that we go around the sun if it doesn't make a difference to me or to my work?"
- Hackers strip the unnecessary from their lives. They zero in on what matters.
- Creativity: easier to "tell a knock knock joke" than to "say something funny."
- New York: constrained around the island of Manhattan. Finland: emphasizing vocational skills instead of general knowledge. Finland: no school sports teams, so these allowed Finland to focus minds and resources and sprint forward academically.
- Kids who are tenaciously focused beat smarter kids in spelling bees. This is the art of being a first-class focuser.

### 10x Thinking

- Elon Musk: Over-the-top demonstration in order to create buzz. But such spotlight-snatching only produces real momentum if there's substance behind it.
- The Internet is the modern-day equivalent of the library of Alexandria. It is indispensible for realizing human rights, combatting inequality, accelerating development, and quickening the pace of human progress. Information access would be the fastest route to world peace.
- 10x thinking: the art of the extremely big swing. "It's often easier to make things 10 times better than it is to make it 10 percent better."
- If we have to do 10x, then it FORCES you to come up with smartcuts. Our belief is that if you can get people to let go of their fear, and to be more intellectually open, intellectually honest, more dispassionate about created, trying new things, and then being honest about what the results are instead of having all these other issues cloud their judgment, then you can get to radically better solutions in probably the same amount of time.
- 10% = breeding stronger horses.
- Good stories and fantastic stories.
- The designer of the Jordan shoe. No computers, just pencil at first.

### PENSOLE

- Hacking the ladder: the challenge to be better today than yesterday. Moving from being a Jordan shoe designer to the PENSOLE brand.
- Training with masters: stole Magic Johnson's discarded shoes so he could draw and then wear them. And so he became a first-class noticer.
- Rapid feedback: Asked LA Gear and Reebok for feedback.
- Platforms: The brands he designed for became platforms from which he could spring in his own career.
- Catching waves: Shift in consumer behavior: sneakerheads. *You can be flat broked and have a $100 pair of shoes on, and that will make a kid feel so good, it doesn't matter if his jeans are bummy.*
- Superconnecting: Carmelo Anthony promoted his shoe design contest.
- Momentum: He left Nike when he was on the top and still moving.
