# Perennial Seller

## INTRODUCTION

- By no means a mainstream book, Enemies of Promise was still a provocative inquiry into the important questions that artists have always asked themselves and one another.
- While it never became a trendy cultural sensation, this unusual book ultimately endured through wars, political revolutions, fads, divorces, new styles (which became old styles and were transplanted by newer styles), massive technological disruption, and so much else. It lasted first for a decade—in 1948, ten years after its release, Enemies of Promise was expanded and given its first reprinting. The book got the same treatment in 2008, some sixty years later, and here we are again talking about it today.
- He made something that stood the test of time. His words still hold up and are still read.
- Cyril was quotable in his day and he’s quoted today. (Most famous are acrid quips like: “There is no more somber enemy of good art than the pram in the hall” and “Whom the Gods wish to destroy, they first call promising.”)
- Though I suspect that’s not why most creatives fall far short of making work that lasts for even ten minutes, let alone ten years. The truth is that they never give themselves a real shot at it. They fail because, strategically, they never had a chance. Not when almost every incentive, every example, every how-to guide they look to, even the cues they take from well-meaning fans and critics, leads them in the wrong direction.
- During the creative process, too many are led astray by shortcuts. We claim to want to be more than a flash in the pan, but at no juncture do we stop and consider how to increase longevity and shelf life. Instead, we use whatever is hot, cool, trendy, and selling well as our benchmarks. As a result, we have to produce more, market harder, sell out worse. It’s a treadmill, and it’s getting faster by the day.
- No wonder people think creative success is impossible. With this short-term mindset, it more or less is.

## A Better Way, a New Model

- In every industry—from books to movies to restaurants to plays and software—certain creations can be described as “perennial.” By that I mean that, regardless of how well they may have done at their release or the scale of audience they have reached, these products have found continued success and more customers over time.
- Take The Shawshank Redemption, for example. As a movie, it underwhelmed at the box office—never playing on more than a thousand screens and barely clawing back its production budget in gross ticket sales. But in the years since release, it has brought in more than $100 million.
- There is a restaurant right next to the Staples Center in Los Angeles called the Original Pantry Cafe that is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year and has been since 1924 (it famously doesn’t even have locks on the doors). Known simply as the Pantry to its devoted regulars, it has amassed over 33,000 consecutive days (and over 792,000 consecutive hours) of selling breakfast food and the occasional steak. Most mornings there is a line outside to get in. The only thing that’s changed in ninety-three years are the prices, grudgingly increased due to a century of inflation.
- A few blocks away, there’s Clifton’s Cafeteria, a restaurant that’s been serving diners since 1935 (and that partly inspired the whimsical personality of Disneyland). On its wall is the longest continuously running neon sign in the world—lit without fail for over seventy-seven years.
- That company was founded in Constantinople in 1623. Zildjian has been making cymbals for four centuries.
- Fiskars, the scissor company, has been around since 1649. The high-end candle company Cire Trudon has been around since the seventeenth century. Trudon may have made its name supplying candles to the court of King Louis XIV and later to Napoleon, but it’s still a growing company—Trudon opened its first New York City retail location in 2015.
- Here’s what’s even crazier: Chances are those companies will still exist in ten years. **They are examples of a phenomenon known in economics as the Lindy effect. Named after a famous restaurant where showbiz types used to meet to discuss trends in the industry, it observes that every day something lasts, the chances that it will continue to last increase.**
- ***In other words, classics stay classic and become more so over time. Think of it as compound interest for creative work.***

### A Lifelong Fascination

- Early in my career, I was a research assistant for Robert Greene, whose historic masterwork, The 48 Laws of Power, didn’t hit the bestseller lists until a decade after its release. It has since sold more than a million copies and has been translated into dozens of languages.
- All of this was my education in the art of the perennial seller—how they work, what goes into them, and why they matter, from both a personal and a business standpoint. I applied this knowledge in the creation of my own company, Brass Check, which has carved out a niche pushing clients toward creating and marketing work to last. Authors we've worked with have sold more than ten million books, spent seven hundred weeks on bestseller lists, and been translated into close to fifty languages.
- Our past media clients, including outlets like the New York Observer and Complex, have become quiet traffic behemoths. One of the startups I advise is a vinyl record club—the definition of a business model (and, surprisingly, a medium) that has endured.

### A Decade? A Century? That’s Impossible!

- Anyone who studies the history of literature, film, or art can see that while luck is certainly an important factor, perennial success is also the result of the right decisions, the right priorities, and the right product.
- I personally love books, and a lot of my clients and readers are authors, so there will be a lot here about books (not a bad industry to study, by the way, with over $70 billion a year in revenue). But the ideas put forth in this book are in no way limited to authors.

## Part I THE CREATIVE PROCESS

The more books we read, the clearer it becomes that the true function of a writer is to produce a masterpiece and that no other task is of any consequence.  —Cyril Connolly

- Terrible advice: "You should spend 20 percent of your time creating content and 80 percent of your time promoting it."
- While there are many different types of success in this world, and prioritizing marketing and sales over the product may lead to some of them, that is not how perennial success is created. The kind of important, lasting work we are striving for is different—we’re talking about making something that doesn’t rely on hype or manipulative sales tactics. Because those methods aren’t sustainable. And they do an injustice to great work.
- Even as someone who loves the challenge and creativity and rigor of marketing, I’m alarmed at how many creators gloss over creating. They fritter away their time on Twitter and Facebook—not killing time, but believing that they are building up followers to be the recipients of their unremarkable work.
- Even the best admen will admit that, over the long term, all the marketing in the world won’t matter if the product hasn't been made right.
- Promotion is not how things are made great—only how they’re heard about. Which is why this book will not start with marketing, but with the mindset and effort that must go into the creative process—the most important part of creating a perennial seller.

### The Work Is What Matters

- The first step of any creator hoping for lasting success—whether for ten years or ten centuries—is to accept that hope has nothing to do with it.
- ***To be great, one must make great work, and making great work is incredibly hard.***
-It must be our primary focus. We must set out, from the beginning, with complete and total commitment to the idea that our best chance of success starts during the creative process.
- The decisions and behaviors that bring you to creating the product—everything you do before you sit down to build whatever it is you’re building—trump any individual marketing decisions, no matter how attention-grabbing they turn out to be. And, as we’ll see later, those creative decisions can be critical marketing decisions in themselves.
- If you have phoned in the creative process, disrespected it, built a mediocre product, compromised, told yourself, “Hey, we’ll figure the rest out later,” then the project is likely doomed before it’s even finished.
- ***It’s why all the pre-work matters so much. The conceptualization. The motivations. The product’s fit with the market. The execution. These intangible factors matter a great deal. They cannot be skipped. They can’t be bolted on later.***
- "It starts by wanting to create a classic." - Robert Greene
- **Phil Libin, the co-founder of Evernote, has a quote I like to share with clients: “People [who are] thinking about things other than making the best product never make the best product.”**
- "The best way to increase a startup's growth rate is to make the product so good people recommend it to their friends." - Paul Graham
- ***Instead, it must be the highest priority of the creators—they must see this as their calling. They must study the classic work in their fields, emulate the masters and the greats and what made their work last. Timelessness must be their highest priority. They have to learn to ignore distractions. Above all, they have to want to produce meaningful work—which, I can say from experience, is often not the goal of people in the creative space.***
- Many people approach their work with polluted intentions. They want the benefits of creative expression, but they desire it without any of the difficulty involved. They want the magic without learning the techniques and the formula. When we look to great works of history as our example, we see one thing: that powerful work is a struggle and that it requires great sacrifice. The desire for lasting greatness makes the struggle survivable, the sacrifice worth it.

### Ideas Are Not Enough

- Writers write!
- Casey: "I don’t want to hear your idea," he said. "The idea is the easy part."
- ***Neistat was expressing a truth every creator learns, one that is all the more essential in an online world where things can be shared with the click of a button: Ideas are cheap. Anyone can have one.***
- The difference between a great work and an idea for a great work is all the sweat, time, effort, and agony that go into engaging that idea and turning it into something real. That difference is not trivial. If great work were easy to produce, a lot more people would do it.
- **If you are trying to make something great, you must do the making: That work cannot be outsourced to someone else.** You can't hire your friends to do it for you. There is no firm that can produce a timeless work of art on your behalf for a flat fee. It's not about finding the right partner, the right investor, the right patron—not yet anyway. Collaboration is essential, but if this is your project, the hard work will fall on you. There is just no way around it.
- **In my work with authors, I've met with no shortage of smart, accomplished people who, I've realized, don't actually want to write a book despite what they say. They want to have a book.**
- ***“Lots of people,” as the poet and artist Austin Kleon puts it, “want to be the noun without doing the verb.” To make something great, what’s required is need. As in, I need to do this. I have to. I can’t not.***

### Why Create?

- Why create:
  - Because there is a truth that has gone unsaid for too long.
  - Because you've burned the bridges behind you.
  - Because your family depends on it.
  - Because the world will be better for it.
  - Because the old way is broken.
  - Because it’s a once-in-a-lifetime moment.
  - Because it will help a lot of people.
  - Because you want to capture something meaningful.
  - Because the excitement you feel cannot be contained.
- To create something is a daring, beautiful act.
  - The architect, the author, the artist—all are building something where nothing was before.
  - To try to create something even better than anyone has ever done it before is even bolder.
  - Sitting down at the computer or with a notepad and committing to pour yourself onto it is a scary proposition. But anyone who has done it can tell you that the process is also exhilarating.
  - It's exhilarating because you are giving something to the world. You are connecting with other people. You are solving a problem for other people. Feeling the work leave your fingertips and then seeing it taken in through someone else’s.
  - Expressing some truth that others have been afraid to articulate—in any form.
  - Capturing some experience and preserving it for posterity.
  - It’s the ability to remake the planet, to alter the course of history, to escape death, to enter the minds of other people.
- ***There’s a reason that so many artists persist through insuperable obstacles—even the starving ones—to do their work. Because it’s one of the greatest and most rewarding pursuits in the world.***
- It also matters. It can make a difference. It can change people. Sure, it can make a lot of money too. It can even make you famous. But these last two benefits are secondary.
- The question is: Why are you creating? Why are you putting pen to paper and subjecting yourself to all the difficulties you will certainly face along the way? What is your motivation? Because the answers will determine how likely you are to be successful.
  - ***This is not a question of “purity.” It’s simple. Compare two creators: one who cares less about what he’s making and more about what it can do for him (make money), and another who, upon sitting down, says, “This is my life’s work” or “This is what I was put on this planet to make.” Who would you bet on?***
  - Every project must begin with the right intent. It might also need luck and timing and a thousand other things, but the right intent is nonnegotiable—and, thankfully, intent is very much in your control.

### What Will You Sacrifice?

- George Orwell: "Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout with some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand."
- Consider that, and then consider the stories you always hear of writers walling themselves off from their friends, families, pretty much anyone and anything that could be a distraction from the work itself.
  - Picture George Lucas literally ripping out his own hair as he struggled to complete the first draft of Star Wars.
  - Consider stories of struggling artists who give up everything—even steady meals—for their work.
  - Elon Musk has compared starting a company to "eating glass and staring into the abyss of death."
- These industries are vicious precisely because so many people want to be in them.
  - Their ranks are filled not just with those great creators who are actually doing the hard work, but with legions more who will do literally anything to avoid that work while maintaining their positions (or illusions) of power.
- At a book signing I gave a while back, a little girl got up and asked what it took to become a writer.
  - All I could think about was what had gone into the book (in short, everything I had) and what I had risked to write it (relationships mostly, but also the gamble to make something new and different that could easily fail).
  - So that’s what I told her. I said that to become a writer takes everything you have.
  - ***“You should only be a writer,” I said, “if you can’t not be a writer.” Afterward, my wife told me that I’d probably scared the kid. If I did, I’m not exactly sorry about it. Because once you get past the lack of saccharine encouragement, there is real inspiration in the more honest explanations of what it takes to make it.***

- Think of the walk-on football player struggling through summer two-a-days to get his shot at making the team.
- Think of the writer working into the night well after everyone in the house has gone to sleep because it’s the only quiet time she gets.
- Think of the artist probing the darkest periods of her life.
- Think of the musician playing another gig at a venue that will likely stiff him, just to make a few new fans.
- Think of the stand-up comedian bombing onstage but pushing through it because she knows this is part of the process—because she knows she’s getting a little better each time.
- There is very real pain involved either way. It’s easy to talk about them, harder to do them. To actually give something up in the pursuit of your work is not only necessary but rewarding.
- From sacrifice comes meaning. From struggle comes purpose. If there is anything to romanticize about art, it’s the struggle and the dedication required to get it right—and the motivating force that makes it all possible.
  - In the course of creating your work, you are going to be forced to ask yourself: What am I willing to sacrifice in order to do it? Will I give up X, Y, Z? A willingness to trade off something—time, comfort, easy money, recognition—lies at the heart of every great work.
  - Sometimes more, sometimes less, but always a significant sacrifice that needs to happen. If it didn’t, everyone would do it.

### It’s a Marathon, Not a Sprint

- Anyone who has run the gauntlet and produced a great product—or even just seen an average one all the way through—knows it’s a grueling process.
  - You wake up for weeks, months, or years on end and yet at the end of each working day you are essentially no closer to finishing than you were when you started.
  - The months and years and decades fall away.
  - The Sistine Chapel took four years just to paint; the planning and the building took even longer.
  - Art is the kind of marathon where you cross the finish line and instead of getting a medal placed around your neck, the volunteers roughly grab you by the shoulders and walk you over to the starting line of another marathon.
  - This is why I asked you about your motivation. This is why intent has such a large impact on your ability to persevere and survive. Because you will be tested. Not once, but repeatedly.
  - There is inevitably a crisis and a low point in every creative work.
  - The filmmaker James Cameron wrote the treatment for Avatar in 1994. He was supposed to film it after the completion of Titanic in 1997, but he couldn’t get started, because the filmmaking technology hadn’t caught up to his vision for the project.
  - He could have thrown up his hands and quit and moved on to one of the dozen other projects on his desk ready to go. But he couldn’t do that. Instead, he spent the next several years helping invent the technology he needed. Once it met his standards, he then spent the next four years actually making the movie, which was released in December 2009.
  - Just imagine all the struggles he endured and the opportunities he sacrificed in that fifteen-year window to make Avatar.
- ***If you’re not sure you have that kind of drive, or if this all sounds unpleasant (granted, to a degree it is), then it might make sense for you to just quit right now. You’ll be glad you did. There’s no shame in it.***

### Great Things Are Timeless and Take Time

- "I’m tired of hearin’ ’bout who you checkin’ for now  Just give it time, we’ll see who’s still around a decade from now" - Drake
- He was throwing down the same gauntlet as Cyril Connolly in a hits-based “What’s hot right now?” industry. Many musicians care about being popular—a lot of them about getting rich and living the rock star life now—with little thought as to what will hold up over time.
- If making money is all you care about, and making it sooner is preferable to later, then a perennial seller is not the path for you.
  - ***There are better, faster ways to make a profit: work on commission somewhere, start another fusion restaurant, get a job on Wall Street, open a marijuana dispensary.***
  - Creating something that lives—that can change the world and continue doing so for decades—requires not just a reverence for the craft and a respect for the medium, but real patience for the process itself.
  - **By patience, I’m not referring just to the amount of time that creation will take, but also the long view with which you evaluate your own work. And the long view can be really long.**
  - Consider all the pieces of art derided and disregarded in their own time, only to be deemed masterworks decades later. Think of the creators whose work was called ludicrous, only to set the standard for a field or spark a new cultural moment.

- Two of the most essential principles in the famous “Toyota Way”—the internal philosophy that has guided the Japanese car company for decades—explicitly extol the virtues of taking a long-term view and respecting process.
  - ***Understanding that systems and processes are important and that decisions must be made with the long view in mind played a role in creating perennial sellers like the Corolla and the Camry.***
  - They are principles that everyone in the company—from the CEO to the marketing department to the workers on the assembly lines—must live by every single day.

- The same is true for our work. Even if it isn't designed to last quite that long or on such an international scale.
  - Alexander Hamilton, one of America’s founding fathers, produced hundreds of thousands of words over the course of his short five decades on this earth, much of them intended to defend the institutions he and the other founders were creating at the time.
  - As his biographer Ron Chernow observes, it's rather shocking to realize that almost all his work was “journalism”—essentially responses to current events.
- ***It’s better to do as Hamilton did, as Seinfeld did, and as Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, reminds his employees: “Focus on the things that don’t change.”***
  - You can’t make something that lasts if it’s based on things, on individual parts that themselves won’t last, or if it’s driven by an amateur’s impatience.
  - **The creative process will require not only time and work, but also the long view.**
  - It doesn’t matter what the deadlines are or who is breathing down your neck—in a year, will the extra two days you spent seem excessive? In ten years, will spending ten extra days, or even ten weeks, seem like a long time?
- Art can’t be hurried. It must be allowed to take its course. It must be given its space—and can’t be rushed or checked off a to-do list on the way to something else.
- ***The old idea that “if it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right” is at the core of great businesses. It certainly makes things a bit more intimidating, but necessarily so if lasting greatness is your intention. As Larry Page, the cofounder of Google, explained, “Even if you fail at your ambitious thing, it’s very hard to fail completely. That’s the thing people don’t get.”***

### Short Term vs. Long Term

- Throughout the history of business, people have spotted trends and rushed into business to capitalize on them. Some succeeded. More were rushed right back out of business when tastes changed. The first and most essential step in the creation of a perennial business or project for us, then, is to avoid making that mistake.
- There’s a certain immediacy and availability bias inherent in the decisions that many creators make—it seems right now—but time is rarely kind to those choices, even if they do make money in the short term. I've heard people say, “Oh, this project is just a business card for me.” I guess I get the logic, but who wants a business card with an expiration date?
- The risk for any creator is over-accounting for what’s happening right in front of them.
  - But what if this moment in time is an aberration? What if trends and tides shift? What if, by the time you capitalize on it, it’s already over? A truly successful band, or filmmaker, or entrepreneur—one whose career lasts decades—must think bigger and more long term than that.
- Take the Star Wars franchise. In one sense, the films were undoubtedly futuristic and took advantage of then cutting-edge special effects. He also borrowed heavily from the Japanese movie The Hidden Fortress for the bickering relationship between R2D2 and C3PO.
  - ***Yet for all these contemporary influences, Lucas’s most profound source material was the work of a then relatively obscure mythologist named Joseph Campbell and his concept of a “hero’s journey.***
  - Despite the trendy special effects, the story of Luke Skywalker is rooted in the same epic principles of Gilgamesh, of Homer, even the story of Jesus Christ.
  - Lucas has referred to Campbell as “my Yoda” for the way he helped him tell “an old myth in a new way.”
  - **When you think about it, it’s those epic themes of humanity that are left when the newness of the special effects falls away. Why else would fifteen-year-olds—who weren’t even born when the second set of three movies was made, let alone the original trilogy—still be wowed by these films?**
- It’s better to play the longer game. Leave behind the hype and ephemeral infatuations for the time capsule and the one-hit wonders.

### Creativity Is Not a Divine Act. It Is Not a Lightning Strike.

- While creativity can seem like magic, like every magic trick there is a method behind it. A timeless creation will not simply appear.
- ***No matter how much we’d like to believe otherwise, history does not bear out the idea of inspiration flowing unheeded from the muses.***
- Any claims otherwise—as you find out when you actually do the research—turn out to be apocryphal, exaggerated, or just flat-out wrong.
  - Are there some exceptions? Sure, Rocky was supposedly written by Sylvester Stallone in three and a half days, but this is the kind of exception that proves the rule. Very few great things were ever created at a hackathon.
  - Yet it’s tempting to think that great work appears ex nihilo. That it simply emerges, in full form, from divine sources. ***As Hemingway supposedly said, “There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.”***
  - The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library has some forty-seven alternative endings for Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms. He rewrote the first part of the book, by his own count, more than fifty times. He wrote all of them, trying them like pieces of a puzzle until one finally fit.
- Young aspiring writers like to point to Jack Kerouac, who supposedly wrote On the Road in a three-week drug-fueled blitz.
  - What they leave out is the six years he spent editing and refining it until it was finally ready.
  - As one Kerouac scholar told NPR on the book’s fiftieth anniversary, “Kerouac cultivated this myth that he was this spontaneous prose man, and that everything that he ever put down was never changed, and that’s not true. He was really a supreme craftsman, and devoted to writing and the writing process.”

- A writer has to be to get it right—getting to five times Cyril Connolly’s daunting benchmark is no easy task. To do this requires being more than a stationary lightning rod. We must be active. We must work creation into existence.
  - Indeed, many studies have confirmed that creativity isn’t like a lightning strike. A creative work usually starts with an idea that seems to have potential and then evolves with work and interaction into something more.
  - “Insights rarely occur fully baked,” he explained. “The creative process is often nonlinear, with many detours along the way that inform the final product.
  - The creator often starts with a hazy intuition of where he or she is going, but breakthrough innovations rarely resemble the seed idea or vision.
  - This is because creative ideas, by their very nature, evolve over time, reflecting the colliding of seemingly disparate ideas.
- What the poet John Keats called “negative capability”—the holding of multiple contradictory ideas in your head at the same time—is an essential phase of creativity: the part where your mind is a whirl of ideas. You have to be able to tolerate this and then refine your idea like mad until it gets better.
- ***If there is any magic in creative expression, it’s how small, even silly ideas can become big, important, awe-inspiring works if a person invests enough time in them. How within seemingly ordinary people there can exist depths of wisdom, beauty, and insight—and that if they put in the work to plumb those deep depths, they might reap incredible rewards.***
- There is a reason that many artists have trouble looking back at their own work. They say it feels foreign to them when they do. The reason is that it is foreign—or at least, foreign to their basic consciousness. They have trouble even seeing where it came from, even as it touches a raw and vulnerable part of them.
- The answer, of course, is that it was not created by them, it was created by the process.

### The Drawdown Period

- ***To wrestle with all these conflicting, difficult ideas that go into creating, you often need real silence.***
- Meditative isolation, where you sit and wrestle with your project.
  - Lock yourself in a room and tune everything out.
  - Spend weeks just looking at an idea, testing whether others had already come up with it, and identify possible problems with it.
- Ex: He had a few months of no reading and rereading, just thinking. Long walks, resting, preparing.

### Test Early, Test Often

- Pivots are common. Up: Was a completely different movie when it started. At some point, the idea of escaping by attaching balloons to a house appeared.
- ***The key is to catch them early. And the only way to do that is by doing the work at least partly in front of an audience. A book should be an article before it’s a book, and a dinner conversation before it’s an article.***
- Ex: Food trucks in LA. They used Twitter to advertise themselves at first. No mortar stores until a few years later.
- Creating is often a solitary experience. Yet work made entirely in isolation is usually doomed to remain lonely.
  - ***This is good news. It means that your perennial seller does not have to be birthed in some single episode of genius, but piece-by-piece.***
  - Focusing on smaller, progressive parts of the work also eliminates the tendency to sit on your ass and dream indefinitely.
  - The perfect project doesn't just float out of nowhere. Don't just keep on planning.

### The Question Almost No One Asks

- Identify someone that will proxy as your ideal reader. Write to please just one person.
- Forget the generalized audience.

### Not Just, "Who For?" Also, "For What?"

- When creating something, ask, "what does this do?"
- Does it have a purpose? Does it add value to the world? How will it improve the lives of the people who buy it?
- ***Great, successful work rarely starts as a solution in search of a problem.***
- Nonfiction: it should very entertaining or extremely practical.
  - Only secondary is: "fulfilling", "makes you look smart", "capitalizes on a trend".
  - You want what you're making to do something for other people and to help them do something, so that they can talk about it and tell other people about it. This has to be in the creative process from the beginning.
- ***The more important and perennial a problem (or, in the case of art, the more clearly it expresses some essential part of the human experience), the better chance the products that address it will be important and perennial as well.***
  - Albert Brooks: "The subject of dying and getting old never gets old."
  - Jon Favreu: "The ones that get the closest to it last the longest."
- Examples:
  - Pixar movies: Kids want to be entertained, and parents don’t want to be bored to tears.
  - WD-40: entropy. Things get rusty and stuck, and WD-40 helps grease things.
  - GoreTex/cold protection.
  - "What to Expect When You're Expecting." for pregnant women.
  - "Happy Birthday". Before that song, what were people supposed to do at a birthday party?

- So the creator of any project should try to answer some variant of these questions:
  - What does this teach?
  - What does this solve?
  - How am I entertaining?
  - What am I giving?
  - What are we offering?
  - What are we sharing?
- ***In short: What are these people going to be paying for? If you don’t know—if the answer isn't overwhelming—then keep thinking.***

### Bold, Brash, and Brave

- I hope it doesn't sound like I am turning the beautiful artistic and creative process into a reductive, boring mathematical exercise, or trying to replace inspiration with the scheming tactics of some internet marketer who searches for SEO terms.
- Again, it's not that creativity is magical. It just appears to be magic to people who don’t understand the trick.
  - Make sure you're pursuing the best of your ideas and that they are ideas that only you can have otherwise. Not only will this process be more creatively satisfying, it will be better for business.
  - Srinivas Rao: "Only is better than best."

- Ask yourself:
  - What sacred cows am I slaying?
  - What dominant institution am I displacing?
  - What groups am I disrupting?
  - What people am I pissing off?
- Brashness, newness, boldness. Stuff that's boring now will be boring in 20 years.
  - People want things that are really passionate. Often, the best version is not for everybody. The best art divides the audience.
- You can't violate every single convention simultaneously. Ex: shows on Netflix still last 30 or 60 minutes.
  - Ask yourself, why are things the way they are? What practices should be questioned and which should remain sound?
  - A work that lasts: you want to provoke a reaction. It's a sign you're forging ahead. Your work may shock people, but it's also a sign that you're created something fresh and truly original.

### Is It the Best You Can Do?

- Orson Welles: "A movie must be better to see the second or third time than it is the first time." It should be meaty, full of implications that everyone will get something out of it.
- Great books of timeless wisdom offer this experience: open them at random, and something will call out to you.
- Deep, complex work is built through a relentless, repetitive process of re-visitation.
- Masters are obsessed with tiny details. The people who design things see the entire product as a work of art.
- Keep on revising your manuscript. Stephen King: "Kill your darlings." Ruthlessly edit.
- Robert McKee: we aren't sure if we can write something great on purpose, but we are sure that we need to do our best on every component part.
  - "I don't think anyone can actually set out consciously to produce a masterpiece."
  - "I think what we do is to tell the best story we can, the best way we can, and produce it in the best way possible, and then see how the world reacts to it."
  - ***Ignore what’s going on around you. There is no competition. There is no objective benchmark to hit. There is simply the best that you can do—that’s all that matters.***

### One Last Thing

- You don't have your masterpiece this early in the process.
- Creative work is as terrifying as it is gratifying.
  - You've put a large piece of yourself into this project.
- ***The more nervous and scared you are—the more you feel compelled to go back and improve and tweak because you’re just not ready—the better it bodes for the project. Because your goal is one that should make any rational person tremble a bit.***

## Part II POSITIONING

- No one will save you but you, so step up.
- Take responsibility for everything that's coming up next.
- Adults create perennial sellers—and adults take responsibility for themselves. Children expect opportunities to be handed to them; maturity is understanding you have to go out and make them.
- ***What does that mean? At a very basic level, if you’re not amazing in every facet, you’re replaceable. To publishers, studios, investors, and customers alike.***
- Seth Godin: it's not just about being good, it's about making your product safe, fun, and worthwhile to overcome the social hurdles to spread the word.
- YOU need to do this. You are the CEO of your work.
- All the responsibility and leadership falls on you, as the creator—even if you have partners like a publicist, buyer, publisher, or whatever.
- The answer is you and only you.

### Find Your “Editor”

- Editor/producer/engineer/coach.
- Why? Because when people are close to their own projects or their own talents, they can lose the ability to see objectively.
- Hemingway: "The first draft of anything is shit."
- What are the chances that your prototype is perfect the first time? WD-40 is named after the forty attempts it took its creators to nail the working formula.
- ***In being forced to go back to the manuscript, I got the books to where they needed to be. I know that now, but at the time it was infuriating to be told, “It’s not quite there yet.”***
- Only you know how to fix it—but you’ll only find out what’s wrong if you open yourself up to collaboration and input.
- James Altucher: 16 rounds of edits, complete restructuring over six months.
- ***Nobody creates flawless first drafts. And nobody creates better second drafts without the intervention of someone else. Nobody.***

### Polish and Perfect, Test and Retest

- We have to have this kind of discipline. The discipline required to hit pause and return to our prospective studios until the work meets the standards we've set for ourselves and that the fans have for us.
- ***We need to have our own test: Does a summary of the book work as a talk? Are the early users you've given prototypes to already addicted to their early versions of the product? Does what you made scratch your own itch in a way that suggests it will do the same for others?***

### One Sentence, One Paragraph, One Page

- Amazon press release before feature: "What are we actually doing here?"
- One Sentence, One Paragraph, One Page.
  - One sentence.
  - One paragraph.
  - One page.
- Figure out what genre we are at.
- Don't wing it.

### Who Are You Aiming For?

- The intended audience is the final blank in the “This is a so-and-so that does so-and-so” exercise. It’s what ties the rest all together: “This is a so-and-so that does so-and-so for so-and-so.”
- Don't say "I don't know."
- If you haven’t thought about who you are trying to reach, then what have you thought about?
- You must be able to explicitly say who you are building your thing for. You need to know this so you can edit and refine the work until it’s so utterly awesome that your target group cannot resist buying it. Marketing then becomes a matter of finding where those people are and figuring out the best way to reach them.

### Is Bigger Better?

- ***Regardless, you must start somewhere—ideally somewhere quantifiable. By which I mean: Who is buying the first one thousand copies of this thing? Who is coming in on the first day? Who is going to claim our first block of available dates? Who is buying our first production run?***
- Robert Greene/Master: Every single reader should be able to find someone they related to in "Mastery". (There is nothing more badass for a reader than to see themselves as the hero.)
- You must create room for the audience to inhabit and relate to the work.

### Positioning, Packaging, and the Pitch

- Positioning is what your project is and who it is for.
- Packaging is what it looks like and what it’s called.
- The Pitch is the sell—how the project is described and what it offers to the audience.
- Tim Ferriss: spends hundreds of hours rigorously testing everything from his title to his cover ideas to his chapter titles.
- ***Law 2, for instance, is about the art of categorization. “If you can’t be first in a category,” the law states, “set up a new category you can be first in.”***
- Your thing should be described in 140 characters.
- Speak in short one-sentence answers and don’t go in with all the legalese.
- Talk about the movie as a movie and the effect it will have on the audience from an emotional point of view.
  - Who this is for
  - Who this is not for
  - Why it is special
  - What it will do for them
  - Why anyone should care

### Why Are You Doing This?

- With a perennial seller as your goal, the track is clear: lasting impact and relevance.
- Jobs: He didn't think about what other people would do. He didn't think about what he should do. He did what he felt was right for the company over the long term. He wanted the computers to be beautiful down to the circuit boards, even though no one would ever see that.

### Coming to Terms with Commercialism

- Too many creators are distracted by critics, by prizes, by buzz or media attention or impressing their friends, and they forget this.
- Marc Ecko: "We can’t prioritize the gatekeepers (the media) over the goalkeepers (the audience). To do so is foolishly shortsighted."
- Rap: They don't just make music and "hope" they'll be successful. They've got hustle.

##Part III MARKETING

- As I defined it in my book on growth hacking, marketing is anything that gets or keeps customers. That’s what we must do now that our work is finished: sell and promote it to the audience we think it deserves.
- I'm not contradicting myself by making marketing a priority now. I'm saying that the order in which you arrange these tasks matters. Marketing is the next essential step in the creation of a perennial seller.

### Marketing Is Your Job

- Considering how few people get to produce art for a living, and how much drudgery and “hawking” is involved in almost every other industry and profession, this seems like a rather privileged complaint.
- Who is going to sell your movie, your app, your artwork, your service if not you? Even if you pay someone else a lot of money, how hard are they really going to work?
- Marketing is your job. There is no magical firm—not even mine—who can take it totally off your hands.
- Plenty of people can make great work. Not everyone has the dedication to make it and to make it work. Marketing is an opportunity for you to distinguish yourself, to beat out the other talented folks whose entitlement or laziness holds them back.

### The Rule You Can’t Forget

- ***When I work on a project—with clients, but particularly with my own writing—I start by acknowledging a blunt but important truth: Nobody cares about what I have made.***
- How could they? They don’t know what it is. And if they do know, still the average fan cares a lot less than I would like them to care.
- How can they care much about something they haven’t experienced the benefits of yet? They haven’t spent years living and breathing this thing like you have—not yet anyway.
- Accepting your own insignificance might not seem like an inspiring mantra to kick off a marketing campaign, but it makes a big difference.
- I always prefer to start from a place of reality, not from my own projections and preferences.
- I remind myself: People are busy. They have no idea why they should care about this thing.
- ***The only way the job will get done—to make people care—is if we do it ourselves.***
- ***These people aren't here for whatever scraps you’re willing to throw them. You may be important in your world, but they are important in theirs. We have to treat them with respect—we have to respect their audiences, just as you respect yours.***

### Anything Can Be Marketing

- Steven Pressfield: Gave away 18K copies of "The Warrior Ethos" in a special Military Edition that was not for sale.
- Peddle everywhere. Have copies of your book in the car.

### Only One Thing Matters: Word of Mouth

- A product that doesn’t have word of mouth will eventually cease to exist as far as the general public is concerned.
- Anything that requires advertising to survive will—on a long enough timeline—cease to be economically feasible.

### The Launch

- Tim O'Reilly: "The problem for most artists isn't piracy, it's obscurity."
- Books: Authors can give away whole chapters, articles, free preview, the whole thing for free for a select audience, events.
- Here are just a few of the services that have hooked me (and probably you too) in a similar fashion: Spotify. Dropcam. Basecamp. Amazon Prime. Some of these were thirty- or ninety-day free trials. Others were introductory versions of more advanced products. Regardless, I was hooked like 50 Cent’s early “clients” and now I pay for them—but only because I discovered it for free first.

### If Not Free, Cheap

- Free is a great strategy, but of course it doesn't work in every situation.
- Though I'd be fine giving large numbers of copies away because I’m able to monetize that readership in a variety of ways, my publisher isn't—because it cannot (its business is selling books). Even after giving a lot of books away to drive discovery, at some point I would have to begin to charge, or that discovery wouldn't be worth much.
- The question, then, is: What is the right price to create a perennial seller? ***As cheap as possible without damaging the perception of your product.***
  - It's good.
  - It's been consumed by a lot of people.
- Amazon: The cheaper a book is, the more copies it sells, and the more money it makes.
- To these people [in publishing], literature is more or less the central fact of existence. Whereas, to vast numbers of reasonably intelligent people it is an unimportant sideline, a relaxation, an escape, sometimes even a source of inspiration.
- ***What we've created is a central fact of existence to us—after all, we made it. But to most other people, it’s optional. They can easily do without our work. A savvy creator embraces this reality and makes taking a chance on it as easy and frictionless as possible for the audience.***
- The most effective campaign: discounting The Obstacle is the Way.

### Find Your Champions—The More Influential, the Better

- Ask the Dust novel.
- I've watched an Instagram post from an influential person take a book to the top of Amazon. When a real person, a real human being whom others trust, says "This is good," it has an effect that no brand, no ad, no faceless institution can match.
- Most endorsements are organic, accidental even. The question is: How do we draw influencers to our work and increase our chances of it happening to us? How do we increase the odds for these accidents?
  - Making something really awesome that exceeds the expectation even of busy, important people with exacting taste. If you don't have what it takes, there's no way to make this strategy work.
  - Consider your audience's audience. Make them look like a bad-ass.
  - Research: ideally, the influencers should also influence you too. They should matter a great deal.

### Making the Ask (And What to Do When You Hear Yes)

- What's the best way to ask someone to endorse or share your work? Trick question. The best way is not to ask.
- Marc Ecko's swag bomb. He sent a sweatshirt with a portrait of Malcolm X to Spike Lee.
- We might not have cultivated Kanye at American Apparel, but I did spend thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars cultivating relationships with tastemakers and trendsetters.
  - I'd notice who was already wearing our clothes or wearing similar products.
  - I'd email them to say hello and invite them to the factory and give them personal tours.
  - I'd send them nice emails and free products.
  - If a celebrity needed something for a tour, we might custom-fabricate it for them and not charge.
  - I wasn't asking them for anything—I was making offers.
  - Sometimes, if I heard they were struggling financially, I’d buy ads on their website just to help them stay afloat.
  - I wanted to establish a relationship in which, when we had something new, I could send it to them, and if they liked it, they’d share it with their audiences.
  - Much of this content still exists, and it’s still selling products today—even though I haven’t worked there or even thought about it for years.
- Always put yourself in their shoes: How would you feel if everyone wanted a piece of you? How would you feel if you got dozens of emails a day from total strangers trying to trick you into endorsing products, essentially for free? You’d be overwhelmed. ***The fact that most creators—especially big companies—just hire PR agencies to do this pitching for them is an opportunity for the DIY creators who don’t. Be a person. Be nice. Think relationship first, transaction second.***
- I've always found that a critical part of attracting influencers is to look for the people who aren't besieged by requests.
  - Generals, academics, CEOs are asked more rarely than authors.
  - Venture capitalists to celebrity investors.
- In my experience, the most effective use of influencer attention is not simply in driving people to check you out, but instead as a display of social proof.
  - Ex: photos of celebrities in your establishment.
  - Social proof sells. The perennial seller acquires it by being legit, and then comes up with interesting ways to use it to their advantage.

### Getting Media Coverage

- Almost every creator loves media attention. Even the ones who claim to hate the media, I suspect, love their media image as outsiders who are too cool to care.
- In my experience, almost everyone—from brands to artists—overestimates the value of traditional PR.
  - At one point, things were different. Try to consider that the media landscape was once so different that publishers could charge media outlets for the privilege of running excerpts of their books. Seriously. These were known as serial rights and were once a fairly significant source of revenue for everyone involved.
  - In any case, since customers aren't paying to consume media anymore, media definitely won't pay you or me for letting us be in their pages or on their airwaves.
  - But back to the myth: We tend to assume that press is essential to success because very often really good and really popular things get a lot of press. ***The question is whether press is usually an effect of a really good and popular thing or the cause of its goodness or popularity.*** The number of overexposed box office flops most people could name ought to disabuse us of this notion permanently.
  - ***Traditional press is good for: credibility and status.***
- **A reality of our culture is that if you or your product has never been covered in the press, there is a risk that people will think you’re a nobody.**

### OK, I Still Want to Get Press

- In 2014, I started getting emails from coaches in professional sports telling me that they’d read my book The Obstacle Is the Way and that it was helping their teams win.
  - What I did next mattered, but first I’ll tell you what I didn't do: I didn't immediately call up those outlets and beg them to anoint me with a trend piece.
  - Instead, I responded to those coaches by offering them as many free books as they wanted. If I saw a player tweet about the book, I direct-messaged him and offered to send some to his teammates. My publisher and I must have sent hundreds of copies over the next year to athletes, coaches, and managers as the news made its way through the sports grapevine that all they had to do if they wanted copies of my book was to ask for them.
  - Then a friend of mine who works in sports broadcasting asked if I wanted to appear as a guest on a podcast she was doing for a small show in Minneapolis. I said yes, and on the episode we talked about the book’s influence on the New England Patriots, one of the teams that had emailed me.
  - This episode made its way to a small fan blog that covered the Patriots, and when they wrote about it I worked hard to have everyone in my network share and comment on the piece.
  - Finally, nearly two years after the journey began, I pitched the story to Sports Illustrated and they were into it. That article—"How a Book on Stoicism Became Wildly Popular at Every Level of the NFL"—sold so many books that the publisher ran out of copies for nearly a month.
- Trading up the chain: By starting with a small podcast where I could tell the story on my own terms, which led to a pickup on a small site that covers a niche, and then sharing and spreading that piece so it was seen by the right people, I was able to ultimately go from a tiny show to one of the biggest and most influential outlets in the world.
- Even without that big payoff, this was a great success—because it was selling books along the way, first to the loyal fans of the podcast and then to die-hard Pats fans. No publicist required.

- When my company works with musicians, we start by finding the most obscure and specific outlets you can think of.
  - That’s how we get buzz going—we want to create the appearance that interest is bubbling up organically (which, because of our approach, it is).
  - We know that these sites feed into the bigger ones, which feed into bigger ones still.
  - The hard work there is finding the influencers of the influencers—and that can be done only with real research by people who actually care about the market they are trying to penetrate.
  - Much much better than spray-and-pray with Vanity Fair.
  - Upside: adds an element of momentum to the narrative. Better to have a steady drumbeat rather than a flash in the pan. You want viewers to have more of the story to dig in.
- Start with smaller media first.

### It’s About Grabbing Attention, Not Getting It

- The media is desperate for material.
- Reporters sit around all day hoping to find good stuff, anxious to beat their (many) competitors in getting to it.
- In this way, the modern media is really a seller's market.
- They crave page views. In fact, if they don’t get page views, they’ll soon be out of a job.
- The strategy:
  - Google their names to find their email addresses and phone numbers.
  - I reach out and explain what I'm doing or what I've done.
  - I let the work and the fact that it matches what they cover—that it’s interesting and compelling, and likely to do well for them—do most of the talking for me.
  - ***I don’t assume it should be interesting to them because it’s interesting to me. I make it interesting, period.***
- Create things that can create media opportunities for reporters.
- But what makes something interesting? What makes for something newsworthy?
  - Those are the essential questions for which I’ll give you an easy answer: The most newsworthy thing to do is usually the one you’re most afraid of.
  - The thing you joke, "But of course, we can't do that."
- ***No one gets coverage for thinking about maybe doing something. You get coverage for taking a stand, for risking something, for going out there and creating news where there wasn't any before.***
- There's no reason to be intimidated by the big media machine. You can make it work for you. Don't be afraid of pissing people off either.

### The Art of Newsjacking: Making It All About You

- Newsjacking: the process by which you inject your ideas or angles into breaking news, in real time, in order to generate media coverage for yourself or your business.
- Trends and popular themes are also powerful forces to piggyback on. A broader definition of newsjacking would then be: when people and the media are all talking about a certain topic, insert yourself into that conversation by connecting what you do with what they’re already talking about.
  - As a new and novel innovation, drones quickly became a massive media trend. The word inside the newsrooms was that drone stories were traffic gold.
  - This was obviously on Amazon’s mind when it made a commercial that showed its drone delivery system dropping off Amazon-branded packages on doorsteps across America. This drone delivery system did not exist. Amazon was hijacking the news to its advantage.
- Ex: James Altucher/50 Cent accepting bitcoin for payment for their books, riding on the wave of bitcoin.
- Using "months": They take advantage of months like "National Depression Month" to get attention and coverage. Same with International Women's Day, National Burrito Day, etc.

### The Art of Paid Media

- Some of the most successful products of all time got by with almost no advertising or paid in-store merchandising.
- Did you discover that product through advertising? Or was the ad just a reminder for something you were pretty much already sure you liked or needed?
- ***I've bought quite a lot of it over the years (at least $20 million worth on behalf of clients), but as an effective tool for the launch of a product, advertising almost never works. It’s far more effective when there is already a considerable audience or sales track record.***
- If a book is a flop, publishers say, not even a fortune can turn it into a best seller.
- A rational, efficient advertising campaign involves two key things:
  - Knowing how much a customer is worth to you (or a customer’s LTV—lifetime value)
  - Knowing how much it will cost to acquire that customer via the advertising you intend to use (or CPA—cost per acquisition).
  - When ego is stripped from the equation, all that remains is whether the math works. Does this Facebook ad drive sales in a revenue-positive fashion? Are we sure that this TV commercial is driving sales, and at what cost? How many ads can we run until we start to see diminishing returns?
- **Most people wish they could just cut a check and be done with it. They’d like to see the tangible results of their promotion in newsprint on the morning of launch day.** Save your money.
- The only advertising the publisher did for The Obstacle Is the Way—now approaching four hundred thousand copies sold—was to support the Sports Illustrated article, which showed the book’s popularity in sports. We took this amazing piece of PR and made sure tens of thousands of additional people read it through sponsored posts on Facebook and other platforms. And we did that only after we were able to see that the article was converting readers into buyers. Effectiveness was our metric, not existence.
- ***But maybe you do have some money to burn. In which case, here’s a crazy idea: Actually put it in a giant pile and burn it, then post the video online. Title it “Here’s What We Did with Our Advertising Budget.” Or give the money to an orphanage and track the impact of your donation on these children on your website for the next decade. Watch how much attention that gets. When you do something unexpected or surprising, it almost always does better than going dollar for dollar against advertisers, who spend millions of dollars a year like it’s nothing (because to them it is nothing—they’re not spending their own money the way you are).***
- Creative advertising is probably the least competitive sector of advertising, because most brands either aren't creative or are afraid to be. If you had a billboard in Times Square with a picture of the cover of your book, it might make you feel great, but it wouldn't move the needle.
- I have a little personal experience in this regard: After I did an interview with NASDAQ in 2016, they featured the cover of my book Ego Is the Enemy on their six-story billboard in Times Square for a few minutes as a thank-you.
  - I got a great picture of it—and my parents thought it was awesome—but as I scanned the crowd around me, you know what I saw? Complete and total indifference.
  - Even though there were thousands of people around, I didn’t see a single one of them look up.
  - **When the ad disappeared, the only thing that remained was my fleeting memory and a pretty cool Facebook post. I certainly didn’t see a sales spike.**
- Newsjacking and advertising can intersect as well. At American Apparel, we once got word that a college student in Wisconsin had been attacked while wearing one of our “Legalize Gay” T-shirts. Springing into action, we bought the back page of the school newspaper and ran a large “Legalize Gay” ad condemning the attack and supporting the students. We offered a free T-shirt to any student on campus—to be picked up at the LGBT center. It was advertising that got attention, that gave a special product directly to future customers, and that was the right thing to do.
- If I were spending my own money on a billboard—let’s say for my marketing company—I probably wouldn't mortgage my house to afford whatever ghastly amount it costs to advertise in Times Square. What I might do instead is buy a small billboard in the town where I grew up that said “Dear Teachers of Granite Bay High School, Thanks for Not Believing in Me. Look at Me Now.” It’s the kind of thing that would get picked up in the local press and then online and people would talk about it forever.
- Another recent example from our friend Paulo Coelho: With the help of his Brazilian publisher, Coelho ran a series of print and outdoor ads that featured the entire text of his famous novel The Alchemist. It’s a giant block of text in 4.1-point font, so it’s basically impossible to read, but it’s still a stunningly clever and brazen move. The brilliant ad reads in part, “Thanks to the 70 million who read the book. If you are not one of them, read this ad.” The result was immediate coverage in outlets like Adweek and, of course, much love on social media.

### One Last Thing

- When it comes to creating a perennial seller, the principle to never lose sight of is simple: Create word of mouth.
- A perennial product requires perennial marketing.
- Which is why if you have to choose between spending money to pay for a publicist or buying your own products and giving them away to the right early adopters, you should go with the latter every time. One is a direct route to word of mouth; the other is a detour and depends on being at the right place at the right time in the right news cycle.
- The best strategy is to try everything and see what works for your project—because it’s going to be different for every single project. When you find something, stick with it. Marketing is the art of allocating resources—sending more power to the wheels that are getting traction, sending it away from the ones that are spinning. And investing in each strategy until the results stop working. Then find the next one!

## Part IV PLATFORM

### From Fans to Friends and a Full-Fledged Career

- ***Becoming a perennial seller requires more than just releasing a project into the world. It requires the development of a career.***
- Iron Maiden
  - Iron Maiden performed for 250,000 people as the headliners of the Rock in Rio festival—twenty-six years after the band was formed. They sell their own beer, they are one of the highest-earning acts in the world, and they travel from sold-out stadium to sold-out stadium in a Boeing 757 piloted by the lead singer, often shuttling loyal fans and crew along for the ride. Is that not a model for every aspiring perennial creator?
  - This didn't just happen, you know. This is a band that was hardly ever played on the radio—and certainly hasn't been for decades. This is a band that plays ten-minute songs about science fiction novels and historical figures like Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great. This is a band with three guitarists who each get a solo on each song. I mean, the name “Iron Maiden” itself comes from a medieval torture device, for Christ’s sake.
  - No, it took decades of work for Iron Maiden to reach the heights they currently enjoy. It meant thinking not only of creating one perennial seller, but of applying that mindset to everything they did. What’s most inspiring to me is that, despite the fact that a huge portion of the population probably has no idea that they’re still a band—and swaths of a generation has never heard of them—the band doesn't care. They care about their fans and their fans only.
  - Iron Maiden focused on one thing and one thing only: building a cross-generational global army of loyal fans who buy every single thing they put out.
- 1000 true fans.

### What’s a Platform?

- Michael Hyatt, former CEO of Thomas Nelson Publishers, writes, “In the old days, you could stand on a small hill or a wooden stage to be heard. That was your platform.” In the literal sense, that’s a platform.
- In my definition, a platform is the combination of the tools, relationships, access, and audience that you have to bring to bear on spreading your creative work—not just once, but over the course of a career.
- ***So a platform is your social media and the stage you stand on, but it also includes your friends, your body of work, the community your work exists in, the media outlets and influencers who appreciate what you do, your email list, the trust you've built, your sources of income, and countless other assets.***
- Churchill: 100s of publications/public works, 11 volumes, 400 articles, 350 speeches.

### Why You Need a Platform

- Hollywood assumes that because they put somebody famous in a movie, that movie will be a success. But fame and platform are not the same. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a platform, one he has meticulously built over the years, allowing him to conquer Hollywood, government, and now social media.
- Casey Neistat was once an up-and-coming filmmaker destined to be the next go-to indie director. He’d created a successful show for HBO. He’d had a film at Sundance. He’d premiered two movies at Cannes. But he left that behind to distribute his work on YouTube. Why? Because the grind of making stuff and then hustling for funding and negotiating with agents and finally waiting for a distributor to get it to an audience was exhausting. It’s hard to be an artist when a middleman gets to decide which pieces of your art make it to viewers.
- The great Stoic Marcus Aurelius once admonished himself to be a “boxer, not a fencer.” A fencer, he said, has to bend down to pick up his weapon. A boxer’s weapon is a part of him—“all he has to do is clench his fist.” Instead, we choose to bind ourselves to an audience, to become one with that audience, and to become one with our weapon.

### Build Your List. Build Your List. Build Your List.

- If I could give a prospective creative only one piece of advice, it would be this: Build a list. Specifically, an email list.
- In any normal scenario—until very recently, in fact—you’d be screwed. You’d have no way to release your product, no way to get your message out into the world. All would be lost.
- Building an email list is a move toward self-sufficiency for any creator. By forming a direct and regular line of communication with your supporters, you avoid ever being disintermediated. That is an incredibly powerful asset. Remember taking stock of all your assets in the marketing section? The things you were putting in your spreadsheet? Your email list should be the first entry on the sheet.
- Kevin Hart: Email list getting from each comedic club in the country. Access to Kevin Hart's audience isn't free. He's the owner of a platform, and that platform is valuable. As Hart later posted, he’s not a whore—he’s the owner of a platform, and access to that platform is valuable. "I worked very hard to get where I am today. I look at myself as a brand and because of that I will never allow myself to be taken advantage of."
- Email over other social media platforms. Email is a permission asset.

### How to Build It So That They Will Come

- What if I gave out monthly book recommendations? Once a month for four years I sent this list out, and as a result it grew from ninety original sign-ups to the five thousand people to whom I announced my first book. By the time my next book came out two years later, the list was at more than thirty thousand, and today it’s at eighty thousand.
- If you keep forgetting your customers, you have to find them over and over again for each project. This is your job.
- ***The best way to create a list is to provide incredible amounts of value.***
  - Give something away for free as an incentive. (Maybe it's a guide, an article, an excerpt from your book, a coupon for a discount, etc.)
  - Create a gate.
  - Do things by hand (sign up sheet).
  - Run sweepstakes or contests.
  - Do a swap. (One person with a list recommends that their readers sign up for yours; you email your fans for theirs.)
  - Promise a service. (The last one is the simplest and most important. What does your list do for people? Promise something worth subscribing to and you’ll have great success.)
- Lists vary in size and quality, but they all have one thing in common—they start at zero. First 100 subscribers:
  - Put a link in your email signature. How many emails do you send a day?
  - See which social networks allow you to export your followers and send them a note asking them to join.
  - Post online once a week asking your friends/family/coworkers to join your mailing list.
  - Ask one group you are active in to join your newsletter.
  - Create a physical form you can give out at events.
  - That’s a pretty decent start, requiring very little effort.

### Your Network Is Your Net Worth

- My friend and client Tim Ferriss is probably the greatest and most awe-inspiring example of this. When I met Tim, I was nineteen years old and somebody’s assistant. Tim was a successful but mostly unknown entrepreneur putting the finishing touches on a book nobody thought would sell (it had been rejected by twenty-five out of twenty-six publishers).
- What brought us together was the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin, Texas. For me, it was the first real conference of my life. Tim, well, he was on what I might now describe as a networking tour. Instead of spending money on advertising or publicity, he was traveling from conference to conference to meet as many influential people as possible, developing relationships, learning, and doing favors. He even spent time with me, a total nobody at the time, because my boss was important.
- Within a few months, he would have a debut New York Times bestseller and unbelievable amounts of media coverage and online attention. Within a few years, that book would be translated into more than forty languages, sell millions of copies, and transform countless lives. And almost all of that success can be attributed to the network he built on that conference tour. (That network wouldn’t help just with books; it led to advising and investment deals worth millions of dollars as well.)
- Tim's strategies:
  - Never dismiss anyone—You never know who might help you one day with your work. His rule was to treat everyone like they could put you on the front page of the New York Times, because someday you might meet that person.
  - Play the long game—It’s not about finding someone who can help you right this second. It’s about establishing a relationship that can one day benefit both of you.
  - Focus on “pre-VIPs”—The people who aren't well known but should be and will be. It’s not about who has the biggest megaphone. A great example for me was meeting Tim. He hadn't sold millions of books then and didn't have a huge platform. Now he does.
  - As is true for so many things, the best time to have built your network was yesterday. The second best time is right now.
  - The best time to get to know people and develop relationships is before you have some favor you want to ask them (this is called being a human being).
  - ***Networking is not going to networking events and handing out business cards—that's flyering. It is instead about forming, developing, and maintaining real relationships. It's about being valuable and being available so that one day the favor might be returned.***

### Relationships Are a Platform Too

- No one is entitled to relationships only because their work is genius. Relationships have to be earned, and maintained.
- If your goal is to become a grand master of important relationships, make sure you’re playing chess and not checkers.
- You better make sure that you don’t overemphasize giving rousing speeches to your troops at the cost of shoring up relationships with critical allies.
- If you see your career and your relationships as investments—if you give and help and build long before you ever need anything, if you continue doing great work over the long term—you’ll find that sometimes you won’t even need to ask for support. Your friends and supporters will come to you. They’ll offer.

### The Most Important Relationship

- While relationships with the “in crowd” matter and they help create an enduring career, nothing you build will last very long without the most important relationship of all: the one you have with your fans.
- It can’t be, as Lady Gaga warned, “Thanks for buying my record, fuck you.”
  - Your relationship with your fans must be more than transactional.
  - It must be deeper. It should be for life.
  - As she explained, she wants to tell her fans, “Thank you for buying my record—and I will live and die and breathe my art to protect your dreams because you protect mine.”
- Participate. Participate. Participate. People who want long-term success must participate—and do so authentically and honestly.
- Think of a creator you've been a fan of for years. How have they managed to keep your attention? It isn't just making something great once and riding that success into the sunset—it’s how great the band is in concert, it’s the thirtieth-anniversary special, it’s the way the creator gives such great interviews, it’s the emails you’ve received or their presence on social media (you know, the posts where it feels like they’re actually writing to you and not everyone else).

### Settle In for the Long Haul

- It’s hard to put it better than Alexandre Dumas does in an exchange in The Count of Monte Cristo. In it, the pretentious Danglars is showing off his expensive art collection, specifically his paintings from the “old masters.” “I do not like the modern school,” he says, expressing his disdain for the popular work of the day (which, as it happens, was early-nineteenth-century Parisian art). To which the sarcastic Monte Cristo replies, “You are quite right, Monsieur. On the whole, they have one great shortcoming, which is that they have not yet had the time to become old masters.”
- It’s not that reputation is some long, hard slog. It’s just that, like your platform, it requires time, effort, and dedication to build. And time—again, lots of time. Audiences often need to hear about things multiple times and be exposed to them from multiple angles before they’re willing to give something a chance.
- ***One of the comedians my company has worked with, Ralphie May, does something like three hundred shows a year. As he explained, “There’s no such thing as a great stand-up who was born great. Every one of them sucked when they started and worked their asses off to get great. I’ve been doing stand-up for twenty-five years and I do three hundred shows a year. That’s how I got great.”***
- Ian Fleming once wrote to his publisher, “I bet your other authors don’t work as hard for you as I do.” He was right. Most think they’re too good for it, or they are too sensitive to push hard enough. I remember early on I asked my agent Stephen Hanselman what separated his bestselling clients from his smaller ones. He said, “Ryan, success almost always requires an unstoppable author.” Throughout my career, I’ve seen this played out not just in books but in all products.

### Build a Body of Work

- That this book is split into two parts—the first half about creation and the second half about marketing—might lead you to believe that the proper ratio of your overall effort is fifty-fifty. That would be a mistake. Because even when we have our “marketing hat” on, we’re still thinking of ways to produce and to make. Making is also marketing.
- ***The best marketing you can do for your book is to start writing the next one.***
- It is frustrating because it is depressingly, frustratingly true. More great work is the best way to market yourself.
- In fact, creating more work is one of the most effective marketing techniques of all. Robert Greene saw his sales really begin to grow after his third book. This was enough for it to be seen as a series. The three books provided enough of a combined sales record for retailers to run promotions around them. Nassim Taleb’s four bestselling books—Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan, The Bed of Procrustes, and Antifragile—are now known and marketed collectively as the Incerto: “four nonoverlapping volumes that can be accessed in any order.”
- It turns out that with each new album, the sales of a band’s previous album will increase. As the researchers wrote, “Various patterns in the data suggest the source of the spillover is information: a new release causes some uninformed consumers to discover the artist and purchase the artist’s past albums.” In fact, sales of non-debut albums increase by an average of 25 percent because of this additional discovery and exposure.
- This was an explicit part of Steve Jobs’s business strategy as well as his personal strategy. As he said, “If you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.”

- In 2012, the New York Times profiled a video in which Seinfeld deconstructs his joke-creating process; the joke the piece focuses on took two years to finish. He’s also talked about another joke—a simple line about how a tuxedo is a piece of clothing designed for when you need to fool a small group of people for a short period of time—that took seven years to perfect.
- This is, of course, a comedian who makes millions of dollars off residuals, is a household name, and has absolutely no need to keep performing in dingy clubs and spending an eternity perfecting his jokes.

- As I see it, not everyone who publishes a book is an author. He or she is just someone who has published a book. The best way to become an author is to write more books, just as a true entrepreneur starts more than one business.
- The best way to become a true comedian, filmmaker, designer, or entrepreneur is to never stop, to keep going. Obviously there are exceptions to this—there are plenty of brilliant creators who have made only one thing.

### Reach Out to New Fans

- In this way, marketing is an ongoing process. The responsibility of finding and reaching new fans is an endless task. It’s why successful people often collaborate with one another—in order to swap audiences.
- What was the net result of these little creative experiments? New fans for both creators.
- As Goethe's maxim goes, “The greatest respect an author can have for his public is never to produce what is expected but what he himself considers right and useful for whatever stage of intellectual development has been reached by himself and others. This is true for any type of creative person. After all, repeating yourself is rarely the recipe for winning over new fans.
- That means: Don’t be afraid to try crazy things. Don’t let your brand tie you down to the point where you don’t explore or experiment. It is precisely these little endeavors that might illuminate a new direction for your career. They might expose you to a new community or group who will eat up your other work. Keep yourself from getting stale. Choose never to become so settled into a rut or routine or type that you are constrained by it.
- Some people are not your fans and never will be.

### Build an Empire

- A few years ago I worked on a book project with two very successful hip-hop moguls. They wanted to teach aspiring entrepreneurs the difference between starting a business and creating an empire. A lot of people do the former; far fewer manage to pull off the latter.
  - There’s another reality of creative businesses that we need to consider: Most of the real money isn’t in the royalties or the sales. For authors, the real money comes from speaking, teaching, or consulting.
  - Silicon Valley entrepreneurs might do well by their business, but they might do even better investing in their friends’ companies.
  - For musicians, the money isn’t in records; it’s in touring, T-shirts, and eventually endorsements and other products.
  - But for a lot of artists, a fixation on the purity of their craft both prevents them from capitalizing on these channels and actually holds them back from exposing their work to more people.
  - Steven Johnson recently produced an extensive study for the New York Times on the boom of creative industries. Instead of the rise of the internet destroying the market for creative work—as many predicted—he found it’s had the opposite effect. For some artists anyway—not all.
  - Our new environment may well select for artists who are particularly adept at inventing new career paths rather than single-mindedly focusing on their craft.” In other words, it’s favoring people who can move horizontally and integrate vertically, who can create innovative empires, not just produce work.

### Some questions to ask yourself:

- What are new areas that my expertise or audience would be valuable in? (Think of celebrities investing in companies or starting their own.)
- Is it possible to cut out the middleman like a label or a VC and invest in myself? (Like when musicians buy back their masters or authors get their rights reverted. Jay Z has a famous line that says if you don’t own your masters, you’re a slave—which is partly true.)
- Can I help other artists or creatives achieve what I have achieved? (Be a consultant, coach, or publisher/label head/producer.)
- What are other people in my field afraid to do? What do they look down on? (These are almost always great opportunities.)
- What can I do to make sure that I am not dependent on a single income stream? (You never know what can happen.)
- If I took a break from creating, what would I do instead? (Maybe there is some long-lost passion to rekindle.)
- What are parts of the experience or community surrounding my work that I can improve or grow? (Live events, conferences, memberships, personalized products, etc.)

- Possible opportunities:
  - Consulting.
  - Teaching.
  - Appearing in advertisements.
  - Campaigns.

### One Last Thing

- Very few people get into creative fields to do one thing. Most of us have more than one book in us, more than one film, and even if we have only one company in us, we’ll probably want it to have more than one product over its lifetime.
- Build your platform now. Build it before your first great perennial seller comes out, so that you have a better chance of actually turning it into one.

### What Happens If We Don’t Get Lucky?

- When Kevin Kelly put forth his idea about having one thousand true fans, he wasn't saying you’d live like a king. He wasn't saying you wouldn't have to work hard, or that the struggle would be over. He was saying that you’d be able to make a living. He predicted that technology had made it possible to work and survive as an artist. Nowhere did he say that it would be easy or that you’d be filthy rich.
- We didn't get into the creative business because it was easy, and we did'’t get into it because of the certainties. In fact, most of us love this work because of the uncertainties, because that keeps it interesting. There remain many better, easier, less anxiety-producing ways to make money in this world. We didn't get into this business for that. We got into it because we didn't have a choice. We do what we do because there is nothing more rewarding than the artistic and creative process—even if those rewards aren't always financial, even if they don’t accrue as quickly as we might have originally hoped.
