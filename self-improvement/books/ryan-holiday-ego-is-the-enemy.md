# Ego is the Enemy

# THE PAINFUL PROLOGUE

- But a story like this is never honest or helpful. Conveniently omitted were the stresses and temptations; the stomach-turning drops and the mistakes—all the mistakes—were left on the cutting-room floor in favor of the highlight reel.
- They are the times I would rather not discuss: A public evisceration by someone I looked up to, which so crushed me at the time that I was later taken to the emergency room.
- The day I lost my nerve, walked into my boss's office, and told him I couldn't cut it and was going back to school—and meant it.
- The ephemeral nature of best-sellerdom, and how short it actually was (a week).
- The book signing that one person showed up at. The company I founded tearing itself to pieces and having to rebuild it. Twice. These are just some of the moments that get nicely edited out.
- ***I'm not someone who believes in epiphanies. There is no one moment that changes a person. There are many.***
- *You think you're doing what you're supposed to. Society rewards you for it. But then you watch your future wife walk out the door because you aren't the person you used to be.*
- As a researcher/author, I studied history and business. Seen over a long enough timeline, issues begin to emerge.
- Ryan tattooed "Ego is the Enemy" on his forearm. Left arm: "The obstacle is the way."
- *I wrote this book not because I have attained some wisdom I feel qualified to preach, but because it's the book I wish existed at critical turning points in my own life.*
- Demosthenes: virtue begins with understanding and is fulfilled by courage.
  - We must begin by seeing ourselves and the world in a new way for the first time.
  - Then we must fight to be different and fight to stay different—that's the hard part.
- Aristotle's Ethics:
  - A warped piece of wood to describe human nature.
  - In order to eliminate warping or curvature, a skilled woodworker slowly applies pressure in the opposite direction—essentially, bending it straight.
  - Kant: "Out of the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight." We might not ever be straight, but we can strive for straighter.

## INTRODUCTION

- ***The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. RICHARD FEYNMAN***
- Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego.
- ***The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance.*** The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility—that's ego. It's the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent.
- *In this way, ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft. Of real creative insight. Of working well with others. Of building loyalty and support. Of longevity. Of repeating and retaining your success. It repulses advantages and opportunities. It's a magnet for enemies and errors.*
- Most of us aren't "egomaniacs," but ego is there at the root of almost every conceivable problem and obstacle, from why we can't win to why we need to win all the time and at the expense of others.
- We think something else is to blame for our problems (most often, other people).
- Ego: The voice that tells us we're better than we really are.
- *Marina Abramović: "If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity."*
- Just one thing keeps ego around—comfort. Pursuing great work—whether it is in sports or art or business—is often terrifying. Ego soothes that fear. It's a salve to that insecurity. Replacing the rational and aware parts of our psyche with bluster and self-absorption, ego tells us what we want to hear, when we want to hear it.

## EGO WAS ALWAYS THERE. NOW IT'S EMBOLDENED.

- Besides the changes in technology, we're told to believe in our uniqueness above all else. We're told to think big, live big, to be memorable and "dare greatly."
- We think that success requires a bold vision or some sweeping plan—after all, that's what the founders of this company or that championship team supposedly had. (But did they? Did they really?)
- ***Sure, ego has worked for some. Many of history's most famous men and women were notoriously egotistical. But so were many of its greatest failures. Far more of them, in fact. But here we are with a culture that urges us to roll the dice. To make the gamble, ignoring the stakes.***

## WHEREVER YOU ARE, EGO IS TOO.

- Stages: aspiring to something, failing, and succeeding.
- Ego is the enemy of all three!

## SO, WHAT NOW?

- What we find when we study these individuals is that they were grounded, circumspect, and unflinchingly real. Not that any of them were wholly without ego. But they knew how to suppress it, channel it, subsume it when it counted. They were great yet humble.
- On Steve Jobs/Kanye: We can seek to rationalize the worst behavior by pointing to outliers. But no one is truly successful because they are delusional, self-absorbed, or disconnected.
  - They did their best work when they fought back against their impulses, disorders, and flaws.
- Removing ego leaves us with humility. Humility/confidence holds weight.
- Some learn humility. Some choose ego. Some are prepared for the vicissitudes of fate, both positive and negative. Others are not. Which will you choose? Who will you be?

# ASPIRE

- Isocrates letter to Demonicus:
  - No adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice, and self-control, for these are the virtues by which, as all men are agreed, the character of the young is held in restraint.
  - Practice self-control, and do not fall under the say of temper, pleasure, and pain.
  - "Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure."
  - "Be slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves."
  - "Constantly train your intellect, for the greatest thing in the smallest compass is a sound mind in a human body."

- William Sherman (military officer):
  - Actually refused the presidency of the US.
  - Promoted to brigadier general and met with President Lincoln.
  - He felt more comfortable as a number two.
  - He had a higher rank to Ulysses S. Grant, but waived his rank so Grant can win the battle.
  - One of the most famous men in America, but did not seek public office.
- ***Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are recognizable—those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To the men of the last type their own success is a constant surprise, and its fruits the more delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether it is not all a dream. In that doubt lies true modesty, not the sham of insincere self-depreciation but the modesty of "moderation," in the Greek sense. It is poise, not pose.***
- *If your belief in yourself is not dependent on actual achievement, then what is it dependent on? Nothing. Ego. And this is why we so often see precipitous rises followed by calamitous falls.*
- Isocrates/Shakespeare: Be be self-contained, self-motivated, and ruled by principle.
  - Our cultural values make us dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions.
- Talent is only the starting point. Will you be able to make the most of it, or will you be your own worst enemy?
- Sherman: connected to reality, came from nothing, and was never entitled to the honors he received. He regularly and consistently deferred to others and was more than happy to contribute to a winning team, even if it meant less credit or fame for himself.
- Cultivate the ability to get out of your own head. *What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness.*
- ***For your work to have truth in it, it must come from truth. Be prepared to focus on the long term.***
  - We will learn that though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek.
  - Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative—one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time.
  - We will challenge the myth of the self-assured genius for whom doubt and introspection is foreign, as well as challenge the myth of pained, tortured artist who must sacrifice his health for his work.
  - Where they are both divorced from reality and divorced from other people, we will be deeply connected, aware, and learning from all of it.

## TALK, TALK, TALK

- It's a temptation that exists for everyone—for talk and hype to replace action.
- Almost universally, the kind of performance we give on social media is positive. It's more "Let me tell you how well things are going. Look how great I am." It's rarely the truth: "I'm scared. I'm struggling. I don't know."
- At the beginning of any path, we're excited and nervous. So we seek to comfort ourselves externally instead of inwardly.
- ***It was easier to talk about writing, to do the exciting things related to art and creativity and literature, than to commit the act itself. She's not the only one. Someone recently published a book called Working On My Novel, filled with social media posts from writers who are clearly not working on their novels.***
- Writing, like so many creative acts, is hard. Sitting there, staring, mad at yourself, mad at the material because it doesn't seem good enough and you don't seem good enough. In fact, many valuable endeavors we undertake are painfully difficult, whether it's coding a new startup or mastering a craft. But talking, talking is always easy.
- Silence is not weakness. Silence is strength, particularly early on in any journey. Anyone can talk about himself of herself. What's rare is silence and the ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsists without its validation.
- ***Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources. Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress.***
- *The more difficult the task, the more uncertain the outcome, the more costly talk will be and the farther we run from actual accountability. Success requires a full 100 percent of our effort, and talk flitters part of that effort away before we can use it.*

## TO BE OR TO DO?

- John Boyd: F-15 and F-16.
- If you decide to do something by yourself, you may not get the good assignments and you will not be a favorite of your superiors, buy you won't have to compromise yourself.
- Reality intrudes on our youthful idealism: incentives, commitments, recognition, politics.
- In every case, they can redirect us from doing to being. From earning to pretending. Ego aids in that deception, every step of the way.
- Job title/name of the school/number of assistants can serve as a proxy for real accomplishment.
- ***Having authority is not the same as being an authority. Having the right and being right are not the same either. Being promoted doesn't necessarily mean you're doing good work and it doesn't mean you are worthy of promotion (they call it failing upward in such bureaucracies). Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive.***
- What the your purpose? What are you here to do?
  - "To be or to do?"
  - *If what matters is you—your reputation, your inclusion, your personal ease of life—your path is clear: Tell people what they want to hear.*
  - Seek attention over the quiet but important work. Say yes to promotions and generally follow the track that talented people take in the industry or field you've chosen. Pay your dues, check the boxes, put in your time, and leave things essentially as they are. Chase your fame, your salary, your title, and enjoy them as they come.
- *"A man is worked upon by what he works on."*
- ***If your purpose is something larger than you—to accomplish something, to prove something to yourself—then suddenly everything becomes both easier and more difficult.***
  - Easier in the sense that you know now what it is you need to do and what is important to you.
  - The other "choices" become distractions. It's about the doing, not the recognition.
  - Things become easier in the sense that you don't need to compromise.
  - Things becomes harder in that each opportunity needs to be evaluated like this: *Does this help me do what I have set out to do? Does this allow me to do what I need to do? Am I being selfish or selfless?*

## BECOME A STUDENT

- Metallica guitarist: Did lessons for 2 years even while being an accomplished guitarist anyway.
- Being a student: there is an ego ceiling impose, one knows that he is not better than the "master" he apprentices under. An education cannot be hacked, there are no shortcuts besides hacking it every single day. If you don't, they drop you.
- Have someone you can learn form, someone lesser you can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge against.
- Get feedback from each angle, and purge out the ego. Falls ideas about yourself destroy you. Put yourself beneath someone you trust. Accept that others know more than you and you can benefit from their knowledge, and then seek them out and knock down the illusions you have about yourself.
- ***If a fighter is not capable of learning and practicing every day, if he is not relentlessly looking for areas of improvement, examining his own shortcomings, and finding new techniques to borrow from peers and opponents, he will be broken down and destroyed.***
- Epictetus: "It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows". You can't learn if you think you already know. You will not find the answers if you're too conceited and self-assured to ask the questions. You cannot get better if you're convinced you are the best.
- Seek out the negative precisely when our friends and family and brain are telling us that we're doing great. The ego avoids such feedback at all costs.
- The ego prefers its own assessment.

## DON'T BE PASSIONATE

- It's not about the "flash of inspiration", being the best and biggest so-and-so ever. Being the youngest so-and-so.
- The reality: we hear we want to hear, we do what we feel like doing, and we accomplish very little.
- What we need is purpose and realism. Purpose is like passion with boundaries.
- Passion is "about", purpose is "to and for". I must do so-and-so. I was put here to accomplish so-and-so. I am willing to endure so-and-so for the sake of this. Purpose de-emphasizes the I. It is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.
- Realism: where do we start? What do we do first? What do we do right now?
- ***The critical work that you want to do will require your deliberation and consideration. Not passion. Not naïveté.***

## FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY

- The apprentice model is responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the world.
- Make other people look good and you will do well. This is not about kissing ass. This is about providing the support so that others can be good.
- Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself.
- When you are starting out, we are sure of this:
  - You're not nearly as good or as important as you think you are.
  - You have an attitude that needs to be readjusted.
  - Most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or school is out of date.
- To work this out of your system: attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful and subsume your identity into theirs and move both forward simultaneously.
- This is about seeing what goes on from the inside, and looking for opportunities for someone other than yourself.
- ***"Say little, do much."***
  - Be lesser, do more.
  - Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them?
  - The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: You'd learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You'd develop a reputation for being indispensable.
  - You'd have countless new relationships. You'd have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road.

## RESTRAIN YOURSELF

- ***Are there not goals so important that we'd put up with anything to achieve them?***
- Our own path, whatever we aspire to, will in some ways be defined by the amount of nonsense we are willing to deal with.
- Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure in the ring.
- *"Your ego will do you no favors here, whether you're struggling with a publisher, with critics, with enemies, or a capricious boss. It doesn't matter that they don't understand or that you know better. It's too early for that. It's too soon."*
- ***It doesn't matter how talented you are, how great your connections are, how much money you have. When you want to do something—something big and important and meaningful—you will be subjected to treatment ranging from indifference to outright sabotage. Count on it.***
  - In this scenario, ego is the absolute opposite of what is needed. Who can afford to be jerked around by impulses, or believe that you're god's gift to humanity, or too important to put up with anything you don't like?
  - Those who have subdued their ego understand that it doesn't degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them.
  - Take it. Eat it until you're sick. Endure it. Quietly brush it off and work harder. Play the game. Ignore the noise; for the love of God, do not let it distract you. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one. You will often be tempted, you will probably even be overcome. No one is perfect with it, but try we must.

## GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD

- Plato spoke of the type of people who are guilty of "feasting on their own thoughts."
- It was apparently common enough even then to find people who "instead of finding out how something they desire might actually come about, [they] pass that over, so as to avoid tiring deliberations about what's possible.
  - Real people preferring to live in passionate fiction than in actual reality.
- He's not that different from the rest of us. We're all full of anxieties, doubts, impotence, pains, and sometimes a little tinge of crazy. We're like teenagers in this regard.
  - As the psychologist David Elkind has famously researched, adolescence is marked by a phenomenon known now as the "imaginary audience." Teenagers: they are convinced that their every move is being watched by the rest of the world.
  - What successful people do is curb such flights of fancy. They ignore the temptations that might make them feel important or skew their perspective.
- There's no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us.

## THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE

- Christians believe that pride is a sin because it is a lie—it convinces people that they are better than they are, that they are better than God made them. Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and connection with their fellow man.
- *"Whom the gods wish to destroy," Cyril Connolly famously said, "they first call promising."*
- ***Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride.*** Most dangerously, this tends to happen either early in life or in the process—when we're flushed with beginner's conceit. Only later do you realize that that bump on the head was the least of what was risked.
  - ***Let's call that attitude what it is: fraud. If you're doing the work and putting in the time, you won't need to cheat, you won't need to overcompensate.***
- Receive feedback, maintain hunger, and chart a proper course in life. Pride dulls these senses. Or in other cases, it tunes up other negative parts of ourselves: sensitivity, a persecution complex, the ability to make everything about us.
- Genghis Khan: "Even the tallest mountains have animals that, when they stand on it, are higher than the mountain."
- ***When you feel pride, ask yourself: What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see? What am I avoiding, or running from, with my bluster, franticness, and embellishments? It is far better to ask and answer these questions now, with the stakes still low, than it will be later.***
- *At the end, this isn't about deferring pride because you don't deserve it yet. It isn't "Don't boast about what hasn't happened yet." It is more directly "Don't boast." There's nothing in it for you.*

## WORK, WORK, WORK

- ***The distinction between a professional and a dilettante occurs right there—when you accept that having an idea is not enough; that you must work until you are able to recreate your experience effectively in words on the page.***
- To be both a craftsman and an artist. To cultivate a product of labor and industry instead of just a product of the mind. It's here where abstraction meets the road and the real, where we trade thinking and talking for working.
- ***Is it ten thousand hours or twenty thousand hours to mastery? The answer is that it doesn't matter. There is no end zone. To think of a number is to live in a conditional future. We're simply talking about a lot of hours—that to get where we want to go isn't about brilliance, but continual effort.***
- That's the reality. Where we decide to put our energy decides what we'll ultimately accomplish.
- As a young man, Bill Clinton began a collection of note cards upon which he would write names and phone numbers of friends and acquaintances who might be of service when he eventually entered politics. Each night, before he ever had a reason to, he would flip through the box, make phone calls, write letters, or add notations about their interactions. Over the years, this collection grew—to ten thousand cards (before it was eventually digitized). It's what put him in the Oval Office and continues to return dividends.
- So: Do we sit down, alone, and struggle with our work? Work that may or may not go anywhere, that may be discouraging or painful? Do we love work, making a living to do work, not the other way around? Do we love practice, the way great athletes do? Or do we chase short-term attention and validation—whether that's indulging in the endless search for ideas or simply the distraction of talk and chatter?
- *There is another apt Latin expression: Materiam superabat opus. (The workmanship was better than the material.) The material we've been given genetically, emotionally, financially, that's where we begin. We don't control that. We do control what we make of that material, and whether we squander it.*
- ***"When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win." The Bible says something similar in its own way: "Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes." You can lie to yourself, saying that you put in the time, or pretend that you're working, but eventually someone will show up. You'll be tested. And quite possibly, found out.***
- Because there is no triumph without toil.
- ***Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this. I am passing the marshmallow test. I am earning what my ambition burns for. I am making an investment in myself instead of in my ego. Give yourself a little credit for this choice, but not so much, because you've got to get back to the task at hand: practicing, working, improving.***
- ***Work is finding yourself alone at the track when the weather kept everyone else indoors. Work is pushing through the pain and crappy first drafts and prototypes. It is ignoring whatever plaudits others are getting, and more importantly, ignoring whatever plaudits you may be getting. Because there is work to be done. Work doesn't want to be good. It is made so, despite the headwind.***

## FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY . . .

- Lowliness is young ambition's ladder. - Shakespeare
- In the early stages, ego can adapt: craziness → audaciousness, delusional → confident, ignorance → courage. ***But no one ever said, "Man that monstrous ego sure was worth it."***
- Ex: the Ira Glass Taste/Talent Gap. Don't let that gap comfort your ego.
- ***"I'm going to be myself, that best version of that self. I am in this for the long game, no matter how brutal it might be. To do, not be."***

## SUCCESS

- Without virtue and training, Aristotle observed, "it is hard to bear the results of good fortune suitably."
- Frankl: "Man is pushed by drives, but he is pulled by values." Ruled by or ruling? Which are you? Without the right values, success is brief. If we wish to do more than flash, if we wish to last, then it is time to understand how to battle this new form of ego and what values and principles are required in order to beat it.

## ALWAYS STAY A STUDENT

- Genghis Khan: Learning, experimental adaptation, and constant revision driven by his discipline/will.
- He was the greatest conqueror the world ever knew because he was more open to learning than any other conqueror has ever been.
  - Reorganized his military units into groups of 10 (stolen from Turkic tribes).
  - Fortified cities (from the Tangut raids).
  - Siege machines (from the Chinese).
  - Winning hearts and minds by getting the smartest people (from the Jurched).
- Mongol Empire:
  - Use every skilled worker.
  - Religious freedom, love for convergence of cultures.
  - Cannon: Chinese gunpowder, Muslim flamethrowers, European metalwork.
- Find yourself in new situations, facing new problems.
- No matter what you've done up to this point, you better still be a student. If you're not still learning, you're already dying.
- ***It is not enough only to be a student at the beginning. It is a position that one has to assume for life. Learn from everyone and everything. From the people you beat, and the people who beat you, from the people you dislike, even from your supposed enemies. At every step and every juncture in life, there is the opportunity to learn—and even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again.***
- ***The solution is as straightforward as it is initially uncomfortable: Pick up a book on a topic you know next to nothing about. Put yourself in rooms where you're the least knowledgeable person. That uncomfortable feeling, that defensiveness that you feel when your most deeply held assumptions are challenged—what about subjecting yourself to it deliberately? Change your mind. Change your surroundings.***
- ***An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.***

## DON'T TELL YOURSELF A STORY

- "Standard of Performance." Instilling excellence. Exacting standards mattered more than some grand vision or power trip. If the players take care of themselves, the score takes care of itself.
- Crafting stories out of past events is a very human impulse. It's also dangerous and untrue. Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance.
- Facts are better than stories and image.
- "Don't try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top." "There is no a-ha moment in Amazon, no matter what you read in the press clippings."
- ***Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here.***

## WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU?

- Most of us begin with a clear idea of what we want in life. We know what's important to us. The success we achieve, especially if it comes early or in abundance, puts us in an unusual place. Because now, all of a sudden, we're in a new place and have trouble keeping our bearings.
- Be competitive, but know the race you are running.
- ***Seneca, the word euthymia: the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it.***
- Not about having more than others, it's about being what you are, being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the tings that draw you away from it.
- With money: If you don't know how much you need, the default becomes: more.
- If you don't know what you want, you start wanting what you don't have.
- ***Maybe your priority actually is money. Or maybe it's family. Maybe it's influence or change. Maybe it's building an organization that lasts, or serves a purpose. All of these are perfectly fine motivations. But you do need to know. You need to know what you don't want and what your choices preclude. Because strategies are often mutually exclusive. One cannot be an opera singer and a teen pop idol at the same time. Life requires those trade-offs, but ego can't allow it.***

## ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA

- Xerxes actually wanted to brand the river with hot irons/throw lashes to it. (Delusional/presumptuous?)
- What got you to a point can be used against you. Things like drive can become entitlement. The instinct to take charge can make you a control freak. Your drive to can make you paranoid.
- Napoleon: "He despises the nation whose applause he seeks." He couldn't help but see the French people as pieces to be manipulated, people he had to be better than, people who, unless they were totally, unconditionally supportive of him, were against him.
- ***A smart man or woman must regularly remind themselves of the limits of their power and reach.***
- *Entitlement assumes: This is mine. I've earned it. At the same time, entitlement nickels and dimes other people because it can't conceive of valuing another person's time as highly as its own.* It delivers tirades and pronouncements that exhaust the people who work for and with us, who have no choice other than to go along. It overstates our abilities to ourselves, it renders generous judgment of our prospects, and it creates ridiculous expectations.
- *Control says, It all must be done my way—even little things, even inconsequential things. It can become paralyzing perfectionism, or a million pointless battles fought merely for the sake of exerting its say.* It too exhausts people whose help we need, particularly quiet people who don't object until we've pushed them to their breaking point. We don't control the weather, we don't control the market, we don't control other people, and our efforts and energies in spite of this are pure waste.
- *Paranoia thinks, I can't trust anyone. I'm in this totally by myself and for myself. It says, I'm surrounded by fools.* It says, focusing on my work, my obligations, myself is not enough. I also have to be orchestrating various machinations behind the scenes—to get them before they get me; to get them back for the slights I perceive.
- ***Seneca: "He who indulges empty fears earns himself real fears".***

## MANAGING YOURSELF

- Eisenhower: wanted to make sure that letters addressed to him were opened by a staff member already. Just to make sure that the letters he got were important.
- He organize the executive branch into a smooth, functioning, and order-driven unit.
- Need to separate urgent from important.
- On the DeLorean failing as a car: it was mismanaged from top to bottom, because the management style was like chasing colored balloons (constantly distracted and abandoning one project for another).
- Things like discipline, organization, and strategy are still important.
- ***In the end, we all face becoming the management/adult supervision we originally rebelled against.***
- Being a manager = changing your responsibilities to be about making decisions. You may have to put aside what you know because others are more competent.
- ***Leadership = transitioning, reevaluating and updating your identity. This requires some humility to put aside the enjoyable/satisfying parts of your previous job. You have to accept that there might be someone more qualified in the areas you were competent in, because you need to also manage now.***
- Responsibility requires a readjustment and then increased clarity and purpose. Set top-level goals, then enforce those goals, to produce results and only results.

## BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME

- Pat Riley: Before great teams win a championship, a team is "innocent", and they come together and work together for that goal. The "Innocent Climb." After the win, ego appears.
- General George Catlett Marshall Jr.: Never caught the "Disease of Me" and shamed it out of the people who did. His sense of honor meant turning down honors, letting them go to the other people.
- Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence is the ability to wait and focus on the task at hand, regardless of external recognition.
- When we've "made it", the tendency is to switch to the mindset of "getting what's mine".
- ***Let's make one thing clear: we never earn the right to be greedy or to pursue our interests at the expense of everyone else. To think otherwise is not only egotistical, it's counterproductive.***
- *Cheryl Strayed: "You're becoming who you are going to be and so you might as well not be an asshole."* This is one of the most dangerous ironies of success—it can make us someone we never wanted to be in the first place. The Disease of Me can corrupt the most innocent climb.
- Marshall didn't even want to look at a painting of himself. He had the same traits that everyone has, but they were "tempered by a sense of humility and selflessness."
- ***Play for the name on the front of the jersey, he says, and they'll remember the name on the back.***
- The credit? Who cares.
