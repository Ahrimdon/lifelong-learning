# Ego is the Enemy

# THE PAINFUL PROLOGUE

- But a story like this is never honest or helpful. Conveniently omitted were the stresses and temptations; the stomach-turning drops and the mistakes—all the mistakes—were left on the cutting-room floor in favor of the highlight reel.
- They are the times I would rather not discuss: A public evisceration by someone I looked up to, which so crushed me at the time that I was later taken to the emergency room.
- The day I lost my nerve, walked into my boss's office, and told him I couldn't cut it and was going back to school—and meant it.
- The ephemeral nature of best-sellerdom, and how short it actually was (a week).
- The book signing that one person showed up at. The company I founded tearing itself to pieces and having to rebuild it. Twice. These are just some of the moments that get nicely edited out.
- ***I'm not someone who believes in epiphanies. There is no one moment that changes a person. There are many.***
- *You think you're doing what you're supposed to. Society rewards you for it. But then you watch your future wife walk out the door because you aren't the person you used to be.*
- As a researcher/author, I studied history and business. Seen over a long enough timeline, issues begin to emerge.
- Ryan tattooed "Ego is the Enemy" on his forearm. Left arm: "The obstacle is the way."
- *I wrote this book not because I have attained some wisdom I feel qualified to preach, but because it's the book I wish existed at critical turning points in my own life.*
- Demosthenes: virtue begins with understanding and is fulfilled by courage.
  - We must begin by seeing ourselves and the world in a new way for the first time.
  - Then we must fight to be different and fight to stay different—that's the hard part.
- Aristotle's Ethics:
  - A warped piece of wood to describe human nature.
  - In order to eliminate warping or curvature, a skilled woodworker slowly applies pressure in the opposite direction—essentially, bending it straight.
  - Kant: "Out of the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight." We might not ever be straight, but we can strive for straighter.

## INTRODUCTION

- ***The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. RICHARD FEYNMAN***
- Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, your worst enemy already lives inside you: your ego.
- ***The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance.*** The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility—that's ego. It's the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent.
- *In this way, ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft. Of real creative insight. Of working well with others. Of building loyalty and support. Of longevity. Of repeating and retaining your success. It repulses advantages and opportunities. It's a magnet for enemies and errors.*
- Most of us aren't "egomaniacs," but ego is there at the root of almost every conceivable problem and obstacle, from why we can't win to why we need to win all the time and at the expense of others.
- We think something else is to blame for our problems (most often, other people).
- Ego: The voice that tells us we're better than we really are.
- *Marina Abramović: "If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity."*
- Just one thing keeps ego around—comfort. Pursuing great work—whether it is in sports or art or business—is often terrifying. Ego soothes that fear. It's a salve to that insecurity. Replacing the rational and aware parts of our psyche with bluster and self-absorption, ego tells us what we want to hear, when we want to hear it.

## EGO WAS ALWAYS THERE. NOW IT'S EMBOLDENED.

- Besides the changes in technology, we're told to believe in our uniqueness above all else. We're told to think big, live big, to be memorable and "dare greatly."
- We think that success requires a bold vision or some sweeping plan—after all, that's what the founders of this company or that championship team supposedly had. (But did they? Did they really?)
- ***Sure, ego has worked for some. Many of history's most famous men and women were notoriously egotistical. But so were many of its greatest failures. Far more of them, in fact. But here we are with a culture that urges us to roll the dice. To make the gamble, ignoring the stakes.***

## WHEREVER YOU ARE, EGO IS TOO.

- Stages: aspiring to something, failing, and succeeding.
- Ego is the enemy of all three!

## SO, WHAT NOW?

- What we find when we study these individuals is that they were grounded, circumspect, and unflinchingly real. Not that any of them were wholly without ego. But they knew how to suppress it, channel it, subsume it when it counted. They were great yet humble.
- On Steve Jobs/Kanye: We can seek to rationalize the worst behavior by pointing to outliers. But no one is truly successful because they are delusional, self-absorbed, or disconnected.
  - They did their best work when they fought back against their impulses, disorders, and flaws.
- Removing ego leaves us with humility. Humility/confidence holds weight.
- Some learn humility. Some choose ego. Some are prepared for the vicissitudes of fate, both positive and negative. Others are not. Which will you choose? Who will you be?

# ASPIRE

- Isocrates letter to Demonicus:
  - No adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice, and self-control, for these are the virtues by which, as all men are agreed, the character of the young is held in restraint.
  - Practice self-control, and do not fall under the say of temper, pleasure, and pain.
  - "Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure."
  - "Be slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves."
  - "Constantly train your intellect, for the greatest thing in the smallest compass is a sound mind in a human body."

- William Sherman (military officer):
  - Actually refused the presidency of the US.
  - Promoted to brigadier general and met with President Lincoln.
  - He felt more comfortable as a number two.
  - He had a higher rank to Ulysses S. Grant, but waived his rank so Grant can win the battle.
  - One of the most famous men in America, but did not seek public office.
- ***Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are recognizable—those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To the men of the last type their own success is a constant surprise, and its fruits the more delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether it is not all a dream. In that doubt lies true modesty, not the sham of insincere self-depreciation but the modesty of "moderation," in the Greek sense. It is poise, not pose.***
- *If your belief in yourself is not dependent on actual achievement, then what is it dependent on? Nothing. Ego. And this is why we so often see precipitous rises followed by calamitous falls.*
- Isocrates/Shakespeare: Be be self-contained, self-motivated, and ruled by principle.
  - Our cultural values make us dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions.
- Talent is only the starting point. Will you be able to make the most of it, or will you be your own worst enemy?
- Sherman: connected to reality, came from nothing, and was never entitled to the honors he received. He regularly and consistently deferred to others and was more than happy to contribute to a winning team, even if it meant less credit or fame for himself.
- Cultivate the ability to get out of your own head. *What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness.*
- ***For your work to have truth in it, it must come from truth. Be prepared to focus on the long term.***
  - We will learn that though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek.
  - Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative—one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time.
  - We will challenge the myth of the self-assured genius for whom doubt and introspection is foreign, as well as challenge the myth of pained, tortured artist who must sacrifice his health for his work.
  - Where they are both divorced from reality and divorced from other people, we will be deeply connected, aware, and learning from all of it.

## TALK, TALK, TALK

- It's a temptation that exists for everyone—for talk and hype to replace action.
- Almost universally, the kind of performance we give on social media is positive. It's more "Let me tell you how well things are going. Look how great I am." It's rarely the truth: "I'm scared. I'm struggling. I don't know."
- At the beginning of any path, we're excited and nervous. So we seek to comfort ourselves externally instead of inwardly.
- ***It was easier to talk about writing, to do the exciting things related to art and creativity and literature, than to commit the act itself. She's not the only one. Someone recently published a book called Working On My Novel, filled with social media posts from writers who are clearly not working on their novels.***
- Writing, like so many creative acts, is hard. Sitting there, staring, mad at yourself, mad at the material because it doesn't seem good enough and you don't seem good enough. In fact, many valuable endeavors we undertake are painfully difficult, whether it's coding a new startup or mastering a craft. But talking, talking is always easy.
- Silence is not weakness. Silence is strength, particularly early on in any journey. Anyone can talk about himself of herself. What's rare is silence and the ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsists without its validation.
- ***Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources. Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress.***
- *The more difficult the task, the more uncertain the outcome, the more costly talk will be and the farther we run from actual accountability. Success requires a full 100 percent of our effort, and talk flitters part of that effort away before we can use it.*

## TO BE OR TO DO?

- John Boyd: F-15 and F-16.
- If you decide to do something by yourself, you may not get the good assignments and you will not be a favorite of your superiors, buy you won't have to compromise yourself.
- Reality intrudes on our youthful idealism: incentives, commitments, recognition, politics.
- In every case, they can redirect us from doing to being. From earning to pretending. Ego aids in that deception, every step of the way.
- Job title/name of the school/number of assistants can serve as a proxy for real accomplishment.
- ***Having authority is not the same as being an authority. Having the right and being right are not the same either. Being promoted doesn't necessarily mean you're doing good work and it doesn't mean you are worthy of promotion (they call it failing upward in such bureaucracies). Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive.***
- What the your purpose? What are you here to do?
  - "To be or to do?"
  - *If what matters is you—your reputation, your inclusion, your personal ease of life—your path is clear: Tell people what they want to hear.*
  - Seek attention over the quiet but important work. Say yes to promotions and generally follow the track that talented people take in the industry or field you've chosen. Pay your dues, check the boxes, put in your time, and leave things essentially as they are. Chase your fame, your salary, your title, and enjoy them as they come.
- *"A man is worked upon by what he works on."*
- ***If your purpose is something larger than you—to accomplish something, to prove something to yourself—then suddenly everything becomes both easier and more difficult.***
  - Easier in the sense that you know now what it is you need to do and what is important to you.
  - The other "choices" become distractions. It's about the doing, not the recognition.
  - Things become easier in the sense that you don't need to compromise.
  - Things becomes harder in that each opportunity needs to be evaluated like this: *Does this help me do what I have set out to do? Does this allow me to do what I need to do? Am I being selfish or selfless?*

## BECOME A STUDENT

- Metallica guitarist: Did lessons for 2 years even while being an accomplished guitarist anyway.
- Being a student: there is an ego ceiling impose, one knows that he is not better than the "master" he apprentices under. An education cannot be hacked, there are no shortcuts besides hacking it every single day. If you don't, they drop you.
- Have someone you can learn form, someone lesser you can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge against.
- Get feedback from each angle, and purge out the ego. Falls ideas about yourself destroy you. Put yourself beneath someone you trust. Accept that others know more than you and you can benefit from their knowledge, and then seek them out and knock down the illusions you have about yourself.
- ***If a fighter is not capable of learning and practicing every day, if he is not relentlessly looking for areas of improvement, examining his own shortcomings, and finding new techniques to borrow from peers and opponents, he will be broken down and destroyed.***
- Epictetus: "It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows". You can't learn if you think you already know. You will not find the answers if you're too conceited and self-assured to ask the questions. You cannot get better if you're convinced you are the best.
- Seek out the negative precisely when our friends and family and brain are telling us that we're doing great. The ego avoids such feedback at all costs.
- The ego prefers its own assessment.

## DON'T BE PASSIONATE

- It's not about the "flash of inspiration", being the best and biggest so-and-so ever. Being the youngest so-and-so.
- The reality: we hear we want to hear, we do what we feel like doing, and we accomplish very little.
- What we need is purpose and realism. Purpose is like passion with boundaries.
- Passion is "about", purpose is "to and for". I must do so-and-so. I was put here to accomplish so-and-so. I am willing to endure so-and-so for the sake of this. Purpose de-emphasizes the I. It is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.
- Realism: where do we start? What do we do first? What do we do right now?
- ***The critical work that you want to do will require your deliberation and consideration. Not passion. Not naïveté.***

## FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY

- The apprentice model is responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the world.
- Make other people look good and you will do well. This is not about kissing ass. This is about providing the support so that others can be good.
- Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself.
- When you are starting out, we are sure of this:
  - You're not nearly as good or as important as you think you are.
  - You have an attitude that needs to be readjusted.
  - Most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or school is out of date.
- To work this out of your system: attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful and subsume your identity into theirs and move both forward simultaneously.
- This is about seeing what goes on from the inside, and looking for opportunities for someone other than yourself.
- ***"Say little, do much."***
  - Be lesser, do more.
  - Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them?
  - The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: You'd learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You'd develop a reputation for being indispensable.
  - You'd have countless new relationships. You'd have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road.

## RESTRAIN YOURSELF

- ***Are there not goals so important that we'd put up with anything to achieve them?***
- Our own path, whatever we aspire to, will in some ways be defined by the amount of nonsense we are willing to deal with.
- Getting angry, getting emotional, losing restraint is a recipe for failure in the ring.
- *"Your ego will do you no favors here, whether you're struggling with a publisher, with critics, with enemies, or a capricious boss. It doesn't matter that they don't understand or that you know better. It's too early for that. It's too soon."*
- ***It doesn't matter how talented you are, how great your connections are, how much money you have. When you want to do something—something big and important and meaningful—you will be subjected to treatment ranging from indifference to outright sabotage. Count on it.***
  - In this scenario, ego is the absolute opposite of what is needed. Who can afford to be jerked around by impulses, or believe that you're god's gift to humanity, or too important to put up with anything you don't like?
  - Those who have subdued their ego understand that it doesn't degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them.
  - Take it. Eat it until you're sick. Endure it. Quietly brush it off and work harder. Play the game. Ignore the noise; for the love of God, do not let it distract you. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one. You will often be tempted, you will probably even be overcome. No one is perfect with it, but try we must.

## GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD

- Plato spoke of the type of people who are guilty of "feasting on their own thoughts."
- It was apparently common enough even then to find people who "instead of finding out how something they desire might actually come about, [they] pass that over, so as to avoid tiring deliberations about what's possible.
  - Real people preferring to live in passionate fiction than in actual reality.
- He's not that different from the rest of us. We're all full of anxieties, doubts, impotence, pains, and sometimes a little tinge of crazy. We're like teenagers in this regard.
  - As the psychologist David Elkind has famously researched, adolescence is marked by a phenomenon known now as the "imaginary audience." Teenagers: they are convinced that their every move is being watched by the rest of the world.
  - What successful people do is curb such flights of fancy. They ignore the temptations that might make them feel important or skew their perspective.
- There's no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us.

## THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE

- Christians believe that pride is a sin because it is a lie—it convinces people that they are better than they are, that they are better than God made them. Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and connection with their fellow man.
- *"Whom the gods wish to destroy," Cyril Connolly famously said, "they first call promising."*
- ***Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride.*** Most dangerously, this tends to happen either early in life or in the process—when we're flushed with beginner's conceit. Only later do you realize that that bump on the head was the least of what was risked.
  - ***Let's call that attitude what it is: fraud. If you're doing the work and putting in the time, you won't need to cheat, you won't need to overcompensate.***
- Receive feedback, maintain hunger, and chart a proper course in life. Pride dulls these senses. Or in other cases, it tunes up other negative parts of ourselves: sensitivity, a persecution complex, the ability to make everything about us.
- Genghis Khan: "Even the tallest mountains have animals that, when they stand on it, are higher than the mountain."
- ***When you feel pride, ask yourself: What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see? What am I avoiding, or running from, with my bluster, franticness, and embellishments? It is far better to ask and answer these questions now, with the stakes still low, than it will be later.***
- *At the end, this isn't about deferring pride because you don't deserve it yet. It isn't "Don't boast about what hasn't happened yet." It is more directly "Don't boast." There's nothing in it for you.*

## WORK, WORK, WORK

- ***The distinction between a professional and a dilettante occurs right there—when you accept that having an idea is not enough; that you must work until you are able to recreate your experience effectively in words on the page.***
- To be both a craftsman and an artist. To cultivate a product of labor and industry instead of just a product of the mind. It's here where abstraction meets the road and the real, where we trade thinking and talking for working.
- ***Is it ten thousand hours or twenty thousand hours to mastery? The answer is that it doesn't matter. There is no end zone. To think of a number is to live in a conditional future. We're simply talking about a lot of hours—that to get where we want to go isn't about brilliance, but continual effort.***
- That's the reality. Where we decide to put our energy decides what we'll ultimately accomplish.
- As a young man, Bill Clinton began a collection of note cards upon which he would write names and phone numbers of friends and acquaintances who might be of service when he eventually entered politics. Each night, before he ever had a reason to, he would flip through the box, make phone calls, write letters, or add notations about their interactions. Over the years, this collection grew—to ten thousand cards (before it was eventually digitized). It's what put him in the Oval Office and continues to return dividends.
- So: Do we sit down, alone, and struggle with our work? Work that may or may not go anywhere, that may be discouraging or painful? Do we love work, making a living to do work, not the other way around? Do we love practice, the way great athletes do? Or do we chase short-term attention and validation—whether that's indulging in the endless search for ideas or simply the distraction of talk and chatter?
- *There is another apt Latin expression: Materiam superabat opus. (The workmanship was better than the material.) The material we've been given genetically, emotionally, financially, that's where we begin. We don't control that. We do control what we make of that material, and whether we squander it.*
- ***"When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win." The Bible says something similar in its own way: "Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes." You can lie to yourself, saying that you put in the time, or pretend that you're working, but eventually someone will show up. You'll be tested. And quite possibly, found out.***
- Because there is no triumph without toil.
- ***Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this. I am passing the marshmallow test. I am earning what my ambition burns for. I am making an investment in myself instead of in my ego. Give yourself a little credit for this choice, but not so much, because you've got to get back to the task at hand: practicing, working, improving.***
- ***Work is finding yourself alone at the track when the weather kept everyone else indoors. Work is pushing through the pain and crappy first drafts and prototypes. It is ignoring whatever plaudits others are getting, and more importantly, ignoring whatever plaudits you may be getting. Because there is work to be done. Work doesn't want to be good. It is made so, despite the headwind.***

## FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY . . .

- Lowliness is young ambition's ladder. - Shakespeare
- In the early stages, ego can adapt: craziness → audaciousness, delusional → confident, ignorance → courage. ***But no one ever said, "Man that monstrous ego sure was worth it."***
- Ex: the Ira Glass Taste/Talent Gap. Don't let that gap comfort your ego.
- ***"I'm going to be myself, that best version of that self. I am in this for the long game, no matter how brutal it might be. To do, not be."***

## SUCCESS

- Without virtue and training, Aristotle observed, "it is hard to bear the results of good fortune suitably."
- Frankl: "Man is pushed by drives, but he is pulled by values." Ruled by or ruling? Which are you? Without the right values, success is brief. If we wish to do more than flash, if we wish to last, then it is time to understand how to battle this new form of ego and what values and principles are required in order to beat it.

## ALWAYS STAY A STUDENT

- Genghis Khan: Learning, experimental adaptation, and constant revision driven by his discipline/will.
- He was the greatest conqueror the world ever knew because he was more open to learning than any other conqueror has ever been.
  - Reorganized his military units into groups of 10 (stolen from Turkic tribes).
  - Fortified cities (from the Tangut raids).
  - Siege machines (from the Chinese).
  - Winning hearts and minds by getting the smartest people (from the Jurched).
- Mongol Empire:
  - Use every skilled worker.
  - Religious freedom, love for convergence of cultures.
  - Cannon: Chinese gunpowder, Muslim flamethrowers, European metalwork.
- Find yourself in new situations, facing new problems.
- No matter what you've done up to this point, you better still be a student. If you're not still learning, you're already dying.
- ***It is not enough only to be a student at the beginning. It is a position that one has to assume for life. Learn from everyone and everything. From the people you beat, and the people who beat you, from the people you dislike, even from your supposed enemies. At every step and every juncture in life, there is the opportunity to learn—and even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again.***
- ***The solution is as straightforward as it is initially uncomfortable: Pick up a book on a topic you know next to nothing about. Put yourself in rooms where you're the least knowledgeable person. That uncomfortable feeling, that defensiveness that you feel when your most deeply held assumptions are challenged—what about subjecting yourself to it deliberately? Change your mind. Change your surroundings.***
- ***An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.***

## DON'T TELL YOURSELF A STORY

- "Standard of Performance." Instilling excellence. Exacting standards mattered more than some grand vision or power trip. If the players take care of themselves, the score takes care of itself.
- Crafting stories out of past events is a very human impulse. It's also dangerous and untrue. Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance.
- Facts are better than stories and image.
- "Don't try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top." "There is no a-ha moment in Amazon, no matter what you read in the press clippings."
- ***Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here.***

## WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU?

- Most of us begin with a clear idea of what we want in life. We know what's important to us. The success we achieve, especially if it comes early or in abundance, puts us in an unusual place. Because now, all of a sudden, we're in a new place and have trouble keeping our bearings.
- Be competitive, but know the race you are running.
- ***Seneca, the word euthymia: the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it.***
- Not about having more than others, it's about being what you are, being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the tings that draw you away from it.
- With money: If you don't know how much you need, the default becomes: more.
- If you don't know what you want, you start wanting what you don't have.
- ***Maybe your priority actually is money. Or maybe it's family. Maybe it's influence or change. Maybe it's building an organization that lasts, or serves a purpose. All of these are perfectly fine motivations. But you do need to know. You need to know what you don't want and what your choices preclude. Because strategies are often mutually exclusive. One cannot be an opera singer and a teen pop idol at the same time. Life requires those trade-offs, but ego can't allow it.***

## ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA

- Xerxes actually wanted to brand the river with hot irons/throw lashes to it. (Delusional/presumptuous?)
- What got you to a point can be used against you. Things like drive can become entitlement. The instinct to take charge can make you a control freak. Your drive to can make you paranoid.
- Napoleon: "He despises the nation whose applause he seeks." He couldn't help but see the French people as pieces to be manipulated, people he had to be better than, people who, unless they were totally, unconditionally supportive of him, were against him.
- ***A smart man or woman must regularly remind themselves of the limits of their power and reach.***
- *Entitlement assumes: This is mine. I've earned it. At the same time, entitlement nickels and dimes other people because it can't conceive of valuing another person's time as highly as its own.* It delivers tirades and pronouncements that exhaust the people who work for and with us, who have no choice other than to go along. It overstates our abilities to ourselves, it renders generous judgment of our prospects, and it creates ridiculous expectations.
- *Control says, It all must be done my way—even little things, even inconsequential things. It can become paralyzing perfectionism, or a million pointless battles fought merely for the sake of exerting its say.* It too exhausts people whose help we need, particularly quiet people who don't object until we've pushed them to their breaking point. We don't control the weather, we don't control the market, we don't control other people, and our efforts and energies in spite of this are pure waste.
- *Paranoia thinks, I can't trust anyone. I'm in this totally by myself and for myself. It says, I'm surrounded by fools.* It says, focusing on my work, my obligations, myself is not enough. I also have to be orchestrating various machinations behind the scenes—to get them before they get me; to get them back for the slights I perceive.
- ***Seneca: "He who indulges empty fears earns himself real fears".***

## MANAGING YOURSELF

- Eisenhower: wanted to make sure that letters addressed to him were opened by a staff member already. Just to make sure that the letters he got were important.
- He organize the executive branch into a smooth, functioning, and order-driven unit.
- Need to separate urgent from important.
- On the DeLorean failing as a car: it was mismanaged from top to bottom, because the management style was like chasing colored balloons (constantly distracted and abandoning one project for another).
- Things like discipline, organization, and strategy are still important.
- ***In the end, we all face becoming the management/adult supervision we originally rebelled against.***
- Being a manager = changing your responsibilities to be about making decisions. You may have to put aside what you know because others are more competent.
- ***Leadership = transitioning, reevaluating and updating your identity. This requires some humility to put aside the enjoyable/satisfying parts of your previous job. You have to accept that there might be someone more qualified in the areas you were competent in, because you need to also manage now.***
- Responsibility requires a readjustment and then increased clarity and purpose. Set top-level goals, then enforce those goals, to produce results and only results.

## BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME

- Pat Riley: Before great teams win a championship, a team is "innocent", and they come together and work together for that goal. The "Innocent Climb." After the win, ego appears.
- General George Catlett Marshall Jr.: Never caught the "Disease of Me" and shamed it out of the people who did. His sense of honor meant turning down honors, letting them go to the other people.
- Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence is the ability to wait and focus on the task at hand, regardless of external recognition.
- When we've "made it", the tendency is to switch to the mindset of "getting what's mine".
- ***Let's make one thing clear: we never earn the right to be greedy or to pursue our interests at the expense of everyone else. To think otherwise is not only egotistical, it's counterproductive.***
- *Cheryl Strayed: "You're becoming who you are going to be and so you might as well not be an asshole."* This is one of the most dangerous ironies of success—it can make us someone we never wanted to be in the first place. The Disease of Me can corrupt the most innocent climb.
- Marshall didn't even want to look at a painting of himself. He had the same traits that everyone has, but they were "tempered by a sense of humility and selflessness."
- ***Play for the name on the front of the jersey, he says, and they'll remember the name on the back.***
- The credit? Who cares.

## MEDITATE ON THE IMMENSITY

- When we lack a connection to anything larger or bigger than us, it's like a piece of our soul is gone.
- No wonder we find success empty. No wonder we're exhausted. No wonder it feels like we're on a treadmill. No wonder we lose touch with the energy that once fueled us.
- ***Here's an exercise: walk onto ancient battlefield or a place of historical significance. Look at the statues and you can't help but see how similar the people look, how little has changed since then—since before, and how it will be forever after. Here a great man once stood. Here another brave woman died. In those moments, we have a sense of the immensity of the world.***
- Why do you think that great leaders and thinkers throughout history have "gone out into the wilderness" and come back with inspiration, with a plan, with an experience that puts them on a course that changes the world? It's because in doing so they found perspective, they understood the larger picture in a way that wasn't possible in the bustle of everyday life. Silencing the noise around them, they could finally hear the quiet voice they needed to listen to.
- ***Creativity is a matter of receptiveness and recognition. This cannot happen if you're convinced the world revolves around you.***
- *It's sad how disconnected from the past and the future most of us really are. We forget that woolly mammoths walked the earth while the pyramids were being built. We don't realize that Cleopatra lived closer to our time than she did to the construction of those famous pyramids that marked her kingdom. When British workers excavated the land in Trafalgar Square to build Nelson's Column and its famous stone lions, in the ground they found the bones of actual lions, who'd roamed that exact spot just a few thousand years before. Someone recently calculated that it takes but a chain of six individuals who shook hands with one another across the centuries to connect Barack Obama to George Washington. There's a video you can watch on YouTube of a man on a CBS game show, "I've Got a Secret," in 1956, in an episode that also happened to feature a famous actress named Lucille Ball. His secret? He was in Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was assassinated. England's government only recently paid off debts it incurred as far back as 1720 from events like the South Sea Bubble, the Napoleonic wars, the empire's abolition of slavery, and the Irish potato famine—meaning that in the twenty-first century there was still a direct and daily connection to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.*

## MAINTAIN YOUR SOBRIETY

- Angela Merkel is the antithesis of nearly every assumption we make about a head of state—especially a German one. She is plain. She is modest. She cares little for presentation or flash. She gives no fiery speeches. She has no interest in expansion or domination. Mostly, she is quiet and reserved.
  - Chancellor Angela Merkel is sober, when far too many leaders are intoxicated—with ego, with power, with position. This sobriety is precisely what has made her a wildly popular three-term leader and, paradoxically, a powerful, sweeping force for freedom and peace in modern Europe.
  - "Fear is a bad advisor."
  - Is it really sustainable for the next several decades? Can you really outwork and outrun everyone forever?
- *Merkel is the embodiment of Aesop's fable about the tortoise. She is slow and steady. The historic night the Berlin Wall fell, she was thirty-five. She had one beer, went to bed, and showed up early for work the next day. A few years later, she had worked to become a respected but obscure physicist. Only then did she enter politics. In her fifties, she became chancellor. It was a diligent, plodding path.*
- Merkel is firm, clear, and patient. She's willing to compromise on everything except the principle at stake—which far too many people lose sight of.
- "Don't be deceived by recognition you have gotten or the amount of money in your bank account."
- ***Other politicians are bold and charismatic. But as Merkel supposedly said, "You can't solve tasks with charisma." She is rational. She analyzes. She makes it about the situation, not about herself, as people in power often do. Her background in science is helpful here, surely. Politicians are often vain, obsessing about their image. Merkel is too objective for that. She cares about results and little else. A German writer observed in a tribute on her fiftieth birthday that unpretentiousness is Merkel's main weapon.***
- *David Halberstam, writing about the Patriots' coach Bill Belichick, observed that the man was "not only in the steak business, he had contempt for sizzle." You could say the same about Merkel. Leaders like Belichick and Merkel know that steak is what wins games and moves nations forward. Sizzle, on the other hand, makes it harder to make the right decisions—how to interact with others, who to promote, which plays to run, what feedback to listen to, where to come down on an issue.*
- We're not talking about abstinence from drugs or alcohol obviously, but there certainly is an element of restraint to egoless sobriety—an elimination of the unnecessary and the destructive. No more obsessing about your image; treating people beneath you or above you with contempt; needing first-class trappings and the star treatment; raging, fighting, preening, performing, lording over, condescending, and marveling at your own awesomeness or self-anointed importance.
- As hard as it might be to believe from what we see in the media, there actually are some successful people with modest apartments. Like Merkel, they have normal private lives with their spouses (her husband skipped her first inauguration). They lack artifice, they wear normal clothes. Most successful people are people you've never heard of. They want it that way.

## FOR WHAT OFTEN COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY

- It's not that he was wrong to have great ambitions. Alexander just never grasped Aristotle's "golden mean"—that is, the middle ground.
  - Courage, for instance, lies between cowardice on one end and recklessness on the other.
  - Generosity, which we all admire, must stop short of either profligacy and parsimony in order to be of any use.
- Behind every goal is the drive to be happy and fulfilled—but when egotism takes hold, we lose track of our goal and end up somewhere we never intended.

## FAILURE

- In 1963, at forty-six years old, Katharine Graham, a mother of three with no work experience, found herself in charge of the Washington Post Company, a vast corporation with thousands of employees.
- Failure and adversity are relative and unique to each of us. Almost without exception, this is what life does: it takes our plans and dashes them to pieces. Sometimes once, sometimes lots of times.
- If success is ego intoxication, then failure can be a devastating ego blow—turning slips into falls and little troubles into great unravelings.
- Gilgamesh: "He will face a battle he knows not, he will ride a road he knows not."
- ***People who have already been through a lot find themselves stuck with more. Life isn't fair. Ego loves this notion, the idea that something is "fair" or not. Psychologists call it narcissistic injury when we take personally totally indifferent and objective events. We do that when our sense of self is fragile and dependent on life going our way all the time. Whether what you're going through is your fault or your problem doesn't matter, because it's yours to deal with right now. You could say that failure always arrives uninvited, but through our ego, far too many of us allow it to stick around.***
- When we face difficulty, particularly public difficulty (doubters, scandals, losses), our friend the ego will show its true colors.
Absorbing the negative feedback, ego says: I knew you couldn't do it. Why did you ever try? It claims: This isn't worth it. This isn't fair. This is somebody else's problem. Why don't you come up with a good excuse and wash your hands of this? It tells us we shouldn't have to put up with this. It tells us that we're not the problem.
- ***Epicurus: the narcissistically inclined live in an "unwalled city." A fragile sense of self is constantly under threat. Illusions and accomplishments are not defenses, not when you've got the special sensitive antennae trained to receive (and create) the signals that challenge your precarious balancing act.***
- Humble and strong people don't have the same trouble with these troubles that egotists do. There are fewer complaints and far less self-immolation. Instead, there's stoic—even cheerful—resilience. Pity isn't necessary. Their identity isn't threatened. They can get by without constant validation.

## ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME?

- When your actions land you a lengthy prison sentence—rightly tried and convicted—something has gone wrong. You've failed not only yourself, but the basic standards of society and morality. That was the case with Malcolm.
- ***According to Greene, there are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utilizing every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.***
- Malcolm X chose alive time. He began to learn. He explored religion. He taught himself to be a reader by checking out a pencil and the dictionary from the prison library and not only consumed it from start to finish, but copied it down longhand from cover to cover. All these words he'd never known existed before were transferred to his brain.
- As he said later, "From then until I left that prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading in my bunk." He read history, he read sociology, he read about religion, he read the classics, he read philosophers like Kant and Spinoza. Later, a reporter asked Malcolm, "What's your alma mater?" His one word answer: "Books." Prison was his college. He transcended confinement through the pages he absorbed. He reflected that months passed without his even thinking about being detained against his will. He had "never been so truly free in his life."
- Most people know what Malcolm X did after he got out of prison, but they don't realize or understand how prison made that possible. How a mix of acceptance, humility, and strength powered the transformation. They also aren't aware of how common this is in history, how many figures took seemingly terrible situations—a prison sentence, an exile, a bear market or depression, military conscription, even being sent to a concentration camp—and through their attitude and approach, turned those circumstances into fuel for their unique greatness.
- *"Many a serious thinker has been produced in prisons," as Robert Greene put it, "where we have nothing to do but think." Yet sadly, prisons—in their literal and figurative forms—have produced far more degenerates, losers, and ne'er-do-wells. Inmates might have had nothing to do but think; it's just that what they chose to think about made them worse and not better.*
  - That's what so many of us do when we fail or get ourselves into trouble. Lacking the ability to examine ourselves, we reinvest our energy into exactly the patterns of behavior that caused our problems to begin with.
  - It comes in many forms. Idly dreaming about the future. Plotting our revenge. Finding refuge in distraction. Refusing to consider that our choices are a reflection of our character. We'd rather do basically anything else.
  - But what if we said: This is an opportunity for me. I am using it for my purposes. I will not let this be dead time for me.
  - The dead time was when we were controlled by ego. Now—now we can live.

## THE EFFORT IS ENOUGH

- Belisarius is one of the greatest yet unknown military generals in all of history.
  - As Rome's highest-ranking commander under the Byzantine emperor Justinian, Belisarius saved Western civilization on at least three occasions.
  - His thanks? He was not given public triumphs. Instead, he was repeatedly placed under suspicion by the paranoid emperor he served, Justinian.
  - His victories and sacrifices were undone with foolish treaties and bad faith. His personal historian, Procopius, was corrupted by Justinian to tarnish the man's image and legacy. Later, he was relieved of command. His only remaining title was the deliberately humiliating "Commander of the Royal Stable." Oh, and at the end of his illustrious career, Belisarius was stripped of his wealth, and according to the legend, blinded, and forced to beg in the streets to survive.
  - In his eyes, he was just doing his job—one he believed was his sacred duty. He knew that he did it well. He knew he had done what was right. That was enough.

- ***In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even perfectly. Yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world.***
- Depending on what motivates us, this response can be crushing. If ego holds sway, we'll accept nothing less than full appreciation.
- A dangerous attitude because when someone works on a project—whether it's a book or a business or otherwise—at a certain point, that thing leaves their hands and enters the realm of the world. It is judged, received, and acted on by other people. It stops being something he controls and it depends on them.
- Belisarius could win his battles. He could lead his men. He could determine his personal ethics. He could not control whether his work was appreciated or whether it aroused suspicion. He had no ability to control whether a powerful dictator would treat him well.
- Doing the right thing was enough. Serving his country, his God, and doing his duty faithfully was all that mattered. Any adversity could be endured and any rewards were considered extra.
- *We are all faced with this same challenge in the pursuit of our own goals: Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we invest time and energy even if an outcome is not guaranteed? With the right motives we're willing to proceed. With ego, we're not.*
- Think of all the activists who will find that they can only advance their cause so far. The leaders who are assassinated before their work is done. The inventors whose ideas languish "ahead of their time." According to society's main metrics, these people were not rewarded for their work. Should they have not done it?
- It's far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort—not the results, good or bad—is enough.
- ***Well, get ready for it. It will happen. Maybe your parents will never be impressed. Maybe your girlfriend won't care. Maybe the investor won't see the numbers. Maybe the audience won't clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can't let that be what motivates us.***
- You will be unappreciated. You will be sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations will not be met. You will lose. You will fail.
- ***How do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? John Wooden's advice to his players says it: Change the definition of success. "Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming." "Ambition," Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, "means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Sanity means tying it to your own actions."***
- Do your work. Do it well. Then "let go and let God." That's all there needs to be.
- Recognition and rewards—those are just extra. Rejection, that's on them, not on us.
- We can't let externals determine whether something was worth it or not. It's on us.
- The world is, after all, indifferent to what we humans "want." If we persist in wanting, in needing, we are simply setting ourselves up for resentment or worse.

## FIGHT CLUB MOMENTS

- There is hardly the space to list all the successful people who have hit rock bottom.  The notion everyone experiences jarring, perspective-altering moments is almost a cliché. That doesn't mean it isn't true.
- There are many ways to hit bottom. Almost everyone does in their own way, at some point.
- In Greek mythology, characters often experience katabasis—or "a going down." They're forced to retreat, they experience a depression, or in some cases literally descend into the underworld. When they emerge, it's with heightened knowledge and understanding.
- *We surround ourselves with bullshit. With distractions. With lies about what makes us happy and what's important. We become people we shouldn't become and engage in destructive, awful behaviors. This unhealthy and ego-derived state hardens and becomes almost permanent. Until katabasis forces us to face it.*
- In fact, many significant life changes come from moments in which we are thoroughly demolished, in which everything we thought we knew about the world is rendered false.
  - We might call these "Fight Club moments." Sometimes they are self-inflicted, sometimes inflicted on us, but whatever the cause they can be catalysts for changes we were petrified to make.
  - A boss's eviscerating critique of you in front of the entire staff. That sit-down with the person you loved. The Google Alert that delivered the article you'd hoped would never be written. The call from the creditor. The news that threw you back in your chair, speechless and dumbfounded.
- It was in those moments—when the break exposes something unseen before—that you were forced to make eye contact with a thing called Truth. No longer could you hide or pretend.
- ***Such a moment raises many questions: How do I make sense of this? How do I move onward and upward? Is this the bottom, or is there more to come? Someone told me my problems, so how do I fix them? How did I let this happen? How can it never happen again?***

- A look at history finds that these events seem to be defined by three traits:
  - They almost always came at the hands of some outside force or person.
  - They often involved things we already knew about ourselves, but were too scared to admit.
  - From the ruin came the opportunity for great progress and improvement.
- Hemingway had his own rock-bottom realizations as a young man. The understanding he took from them is expressed timelessly in his book A Farewell to Arms. He wrote, "The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills."
- The world can show you the truth, but no one can force you to accept it.
- Face the symptoms. Cure the disease. Ego makes it so hard—it's easier to delay, to double down, to deliberately avoid seeing the changes we need to make in our lives.
- Change begins by hearing the criticism and the words of the people around you. Even if those words are mean spirited, angry, or hurtful. It means weighing them, discarding the ones that don't matter, and reflecting on the ones you do.

## DRAW THE LINE

- It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character.—MARCUS AURELIUS
- Steve Jobs's response to his firing was understandable. But then he started a new company and threw his whole life into it. He tried to learn as best he could from the management mistakes at the root of his first failure.
  - He started another company after that too, called Pixar. Steve Jobs, the famous egomaniac who parked in handicap parking spaces just because he could, responded in this critical moment in a surprising way. Humble for CEOs convinced of their own genius, anyway. He worked until he'd not only proven himself again, but significantly resolved the flaws that had caused his downfall to begin with.
- Ego kills what we love. Sometimes, it comes close to killing us too.
- *When a team looks like they're going to lose a game, the coach doesn't call them all over and lie to them. Instead, he or she reminds them who they are and what they're capable of, and urges them to go back out there and embody that. With winning or miracles off their minds, a good team does its best to complete the game at the highest standard possible (and share the playing time with other players who don't regularly play). And sometimes, they even come back and win.*
- The only real failure is abandoning your principles. Killing what you love because you can't bear to part from it is selfish and stupid. If your reputation can't absorb a few blows, it wasn't worth anything in the first place.

## MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SCORECARD

- For years, Scott Pioli, director of personnel for the Patriots, kept a photo on his desk of Dave Stachelski, a player the team had drafted in the 5th round, but who never made it through training camp. It was a reminder: You're not as good as you think. You don't have it all figured out. Stay focused. Do better.
- *This is characteristic of how great people think. It's not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don't much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. And these standards are much, much higher than everyone else's.*
- The Patriots saw the Brady pick as being more lucky than smart. And though some people are fine giving themselves credit for luck, they weren't. In this instance, instead of celebrating or congratulating themselves, they put their heads back down and focused on how to get even better. That's what makes humility such a powerful force—organizationally, personally, professionally.
- Ego can't see both sides of the issue. It can't get better because it only sees the validation. Remember, "Vain men never hear anything but praise." It can only see what's going well, not what isn't. It's why you might see egomaniacs with temporary leads, but rarely lasting runs of it.
- ***For us, the scoreboard can't be the only scoreboard. Warren Buffett has said the same thing, making a distinction between the inner scorecard and the external one. Your potential, the absolute best you're capable of—that's the metric to measure yourself against. Your standards are. Winning is not enough. People can get lucky and win. People can be assholes and win. Anyone can win. But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves.***
- Harsh, yes. The flip side is that it means being honestly able to be proud and strong during the occasional defeat as well. When you take ego out of the equation, other people's opinions and external markers won't matter as much. That's more difficult, but ultimately a formula for resilience.
- *Think of all the people who excuse their behavior—politicians, powerful CEOs, and the like—as "not technically illegal." Think of the times that you've excused your own with "no one will know." This is the moral gray area that our ego loves to exploit. Holding your ego against a standard (inner or indifferent or whatever you want to call it) makes it less and less likely that excess or wrongdoing is going to be tolerated by you. Because it's not about what you can get away with, it's about what you should or shouldn't do.*

## ALWAYS LOVE

- Hearst and Citizen Kane: The movie failed commercially because of Hearst.
- We all have stuff that pisses us off. The more successful or powerful we are, the more there will be that we think we need to protect in terms of our legacy, image, and influence. If we're not careful, however, we can end up wasting an incredible amount of time trying to keep the world from displeasing or disrespecting us.
- It is a sobering thought to consider for a moment all the needless death and needless waste inflicted over the eons by angry men or aggrieved women on other people, on society, and on themselves. Over what? Reasons that can hardly be remembered.
- *Douglass would have none of that. He wasn't angry. He wasn't hurt. He replied with great fervor: "They cannot degrade Frederick Douglass. The soul that is within me no man can degrade. I am not the one that is being degraded on account of this treatment, but those who are inflicting it upon me."*
- It took a very long time for Welles's genius in that movie to finally be acknowledged by the rest of the world. No matter, Welles soldiered on, making other movies and producing other fantastic art. By all accounts, he lived a fulfilling and happy life. Eventually, Citizen Kane secured its place in the forefront of cinematic history. Seventy years after the movie's debut, it was finally played at Hearst Castle at San Simeon, which is now a state park.
- *The events he endured weren't exactly fair, but at least he didn't let it ruin his life. As Welles's girlfriend of twenty-plus years said in his eulogy, referring not just to Hearst, but to every slight he ever received in his long career in a notoriously ruthless industry, "I promise you it didn't make him bitter."*

## FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY . . .

- There is no way around it: We will experience difficulty. We will feel the touch of failure. As Benjamin Franklin observed, those who "drink to the bottom of the cup must expect to meet with some of the dregs."
- *But what if those dregs weren't so bad? As Harold Geneen put it, "People learn from their failures. Seldom do they learn anything from success." It's why the old Celtic saying tells us, "See much, study much, suffer much, that is the path to wisdom."*
- Wisdom or ignorance? Ego is the swing vote.
- Aspiration leads to success (and adversity). Success creates its own adversity (and, hopefully, new ambitions). And adversity leads to aspiration and more success. It's an endless loop.
- All of us exist on this continuum. We occupy different places on it at various points in our lives. But when we do fail, it sucks. No question.
- Whatever is next for us, we can be sure of one thing we'll want to avoid. Ego. It makes all the steps hard, but failure is the one it will make permanent. Unless we learn, right here and right now, from our mistakes. Unless we use this moment as an opportunity to understand ourselves and our own mind better, ego will seek out failure like true north.

# EPILOGUE

- *It is no easy task to go head-to-head with one's ego. To accept first that ego may be there. Then to subject it to scrutiny and criticism. Most of us can't handle uncomfortable self-examination. It's easier to do just about anything else—in fact, some of the world's most unbelievable accomplishments are undoubtedly a result of a desire to avoid facing the darkness of ego.*
- My friend the philosopher and martial artist Daniele Bolelli once gave me a helpful metaphor. He explained that training was like sweeping the floor. Just because we've done it once, doesn't mean the floor is clean forever. Every day the dust comes back. Every day we must sweep.
- *We all experience success and failure in our own way. Struggling to write this book, I went through four hard-fought but rejected drafts of the proposal and dozens of drafts of the manuscript. On my earlier projects, I'm sure the strain would have broken me. Maybe I would have quit or tried to work with someone else. Maybe I would have dug in my heels to get my way and irreparably damaged the book.*
- *At some point during the process, I came up with a therapeutic device. After each draft, I would tear up the pages and feed the paper to a worm compost I keep in my garage. A few months later, those painful pages were dirt that nourished my yard, which I could walk with bare feet. It was a real and tangible connection to that larger immensity. I liked to remind myself that the same process is going to happen to me when I'm done, when I die and nature tears me up.*
- One of the most freeing realizations came to me while I was writing and thinking about the ideas in the pages you've just read. It occurred to me what a damaging delusion this notion that our lives are "grand monuments" set to last for all time really is. Any ambitious person knows that feeling—that you must do great things, that you must get your way, and that if you don't that you're a worthless failure and the world is conspiring against you. There is so much pressure that eventually we all break under it or are broken by it.
