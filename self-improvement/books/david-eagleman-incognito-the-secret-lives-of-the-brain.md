## Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain

- A voice IS physical. You can capture density changes and reproduce them later (hence the tape recorder).
- So what is a thought? Thoughts have physical stuff behind them--deep sleep means no thoughts, dream sleep means bizarre thoughts. We can change our thoughts by adding chemicals (alcohol, cigarettes, exercise).
- Damaging a part of brain tissue can change your capacity to understand music, see colors, make decisions.
- **Much of what we see and feel is not under our conscious control.**
- Dilated eyes: men find more attractive, but they don't know why. It's an unconscious thing.
- Our brains run mostly on autopilot, not conscious decision making.
- You can't sign your name with two hands when you think about it. You need to not think about it.
- Galileo being imprisoned: not everyone appreciates a radical shift of worldview.
- Freud: The mind was not simply equal to the conscious part we live with, rather it was like an iceberg. Since he had no brain technologies, he did the talking to the patients thing.
- How do you get angry at yourself?

### What is Experience Really Like?

- We get fooled by optical illusions like Mach bands.
- One-third of the brain is devoted to vision. This is because your brain needs to take context into account ("Is this a building far away, or a toy?").
- When patients recover their eyesight, they do not suddenly see the world, but they must learn to see again.
- We have limited amounts of vision (cone). Your two eyes see things differently.
- Our eyes have a hard time perceiving change (spot the difference photos?).
- Placing your eyes on something = no guarantee you saw it. Magicians perform sleight on hand in full view. This can lead to drivers hitting pedestrians etc.
- We can know a feature of a stimulus while being unable to answer others. |||||| You can know that these are vertical lines but it takes time to figure out how many lines are there.
- The brain computes on a need-to-know basis. You don't continuously track the position of your tongue until you need it. We are not conscious of most things.
- Looking at a painting: depending on what was asked ("age" or "wealth"), people look at faces or material possessions.
- Blind spot: where the photoreceptors for the eye are missing. When something is in the blind spot, your brain fills in that visual space with the patterns around it.
- Motion: A woman was able to see things, but the motion part of her visual system was damaged. So she can see a truck in one location, then another, but the truck had no sense of movement. She can see water in a pitcher, then a column of water from the pitcher, then a puddle of water in the glass. Motion is "painted on" our views of the world.
- You can "see" but not have the learnings of how to see. Mike May: lost vision at 3, vision system not fully developed, got surgery in his 40s, his eyes can see but its vision system can only interpret some things.
- A blind woman knows the layout of her room, but she can't draw it on paper because she can't convert 3D rooms to a 2D representation.
- Blind people: they had this thing where a video camera can convert its output to bumps, apparently this can make blind people "see".
- Eric Weihenmayer: Blind, but he can see with a grid of six hundred tiny electrodes with his tongue. The grid translates a video input into patterns of electrical pulses, allowing the tongue to discern qualities ascribed to vision. This is similar to Braille (bumps), you get familiar with that "alphabet" that you can derive meaning from it.
- The brain is plastic enough that it can understand new languages. Theoretically, we can plug new sorts of data streams in our brain! (This is working in mice.)
- Not only the spinal cord, but the whole nervous system works this way: internally generated activity is modulated by sensory input.
- When you are awake, visual data comes from eyes. When you are asleep (dreaming), in pitch-dark solitary confinement, your vision comes from somewhere else, hence hallucinations.

- Feedforward: a feature of brain wiring where you can do this: you can imagine things (like an ant walking on a tablecloth) and "see" the thing? Your higher-level brain is driving the lower-level ones.
- Combining the sound of a syllable with a video of another syllable can lead to a new syllable?
- Flashed spot + 2 beeps = flashing twice?
- Perception: not just about building up bits of captured data, but instead by matching expectations to incoming sensory data. Ex: seeing patterns in blobs.
