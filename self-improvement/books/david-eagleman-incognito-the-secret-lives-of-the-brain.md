## Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain

- A voice IS physical. You can capture density changes and reproduce them later (hence the tape recorder).
- So what is a thought? Thoughts have physical stuff behind them--deep sleep means no thoughts, dream sleep means bizarre thoughts. We can change our thoughts by adding chemicals (alcohol, cigarettes, exercise).
- Damaging a part of brain tissue can change your capacity to understand music, see colors, make decisions.
- **Much of what we see and feel is not under our conscious control.**
- Dilated eyes: men find more attractive, but they don't know why. It's an unconscious thing.
- Our brains run mostly on autopilot, not conscious decision making.
- You can't sign your name with two hands when you think about it. You need to not think about it.
- Galileo being imprisoned: not everyone appreciates a radical shift of worldview.
- Freud: The mind was not simply equal to the conscious part we live with, rather it was like an iceberg. Since he had no brain technologies, he did the talking to the patients thing.
- How do you get angry at yourself?

### What is Experience Really Like?

- We get fooled by optical illusions like Mach bands.
- One-third of the brain is devoted to vision. This is because your brain needs to take context into account ("Is this a building far away, or a toy?").
- When patients recover their eyesight, they do not suddenly see the world, but they must learn to see again.
- We have limited amounts of vision (cone). Your two eyes see things differently.
- Our eyes have a hard time perceiving change (spot the difference photos?).
- Placing your eyes on something = no guarantee you saw it. Magicians perform sleight on hand in full view. This can lead to drivers hitting pedestrians etc.
- We can know a feature of a stimulus while being unable to answer others. |||||| You can know that these are vertical lines but it takes time to figure out how many lines are there.
- The brain computes on a need-to-know basis. You don't continuously track the position of your tongue until you need it. We are not conscious of most things.
- Looking at a painting: depending on what was asked ("age" or "wealth"), people look at faces or material possessions.
- Blind spot: where the photoreceptors for the eye are missing. When something is in the blind spot, your brain fills in that visual space with the patterns around it.
- Motion: A woman was able to see things, but the motion part of her visual system was damaged. So she can see a truck in one location, then another, but the truck had no sense of movement. She can see water in a pitcher, then a column of water from the pitcher, then a puddle of water in the glass. Motion is "painted on" our views of the world.
- You can "see" but not have the learnings of how to see. Mike May: lost vision at 3, vision system not fully developed, got surgery in his 40s, his eyes can see but its vision system can only interpret some things.
- A blind woman knows the layout of her room, but she can't draw it on paper because she can't convert 3D rooms to a 2D representation.
- Blind people: they had this thing where a video camera can convert its output to bumps, apparently this can make blind people "see".
- Eric Weihenmayer: Blind, but he can see with a grid of six hundred tiny electrodes with his tongue. The grid translates a video input into patterns of electrical pulses, allowing the tongue to discern qualities ascribed to vision. This is similar to Braille (bumps), you get familiar with that "alphabet" that you can derive meaning from it.
- The brain is plastic enough that it can understand new languages. Theoretically, we can plug new sorts of data streams in our brain! (This is working in mice.)
- Not only the spinal cord, but the whole nervous system works this way: internally generated activity is modulated by sensory input.
- When you are awake, visual data comes from eyes. When you are asleep (dreaming), in pitch-dark solitary confinement, your vision comes from somewhere else, hence hallucinations.

- Feedforward: a feature of brain wiring where you can do this: you can imagine things (like an ant walking on a tablecloth) and "see" the thing? Your higher-level brain is driving the lower-level ones.
- Combining the sound of a syllable with a video of another syllable can lead to a new syllable?
- Flashed spot + 2 beeps = flashing twice?
- Perception: not just about building up bits of captured data, but instead by matching expectations to incoming sensory data. Ex: seeing patterns in blobs.
- Perception reflects the active comparison of sensory inputs with internal predictions, and the awareness of your surroundings occurs only when sensory inputs VIOLATE expectations.
  - Ex: riding a bike, you have a great conscious concentration, after some time, when your sensory-motor predictions have been perfected, riding becomes unconscious. You become unaware of how you're holding the handlebars, applying pressure to the pedals, and balancing your torso.
  - This is why you tickle yourself. Other people can tickle you, because their tickling maneuvers are not predictable to you.
  - Schizophrenics can tickle themselves because of a problem with their timing that does not allow their motor actions and resulting sensations to be correctly sequenced.
  - Anton's syndrome: A person is blind, but the patient DENIES her blindness. They truly believe they are not blind. They are experiencing what they take to be vision, but it is all internally generated.
  - The perception of time: By the time your brain perceives a snap, it's long gone. But you think the sound and the action are simultaneous.
  - Other ex: look at your left then right eyes in the mirror, they don't look like they are moving.
  - Perceived time can also change, when you look at the second hand on the wall, it looks like it's frozen first, then it ticks.
  - Fighter pilots: "Trust your instruments." Senses can lie. Your brain will make time-saving and resource-saving assumptions and tries to see the world only as well as it needs to.

### Mind: The Gap

- You are not consciously aware that when changing lanes (left to right), you point the steering wheel back to the left after you've changed lanes.
- Implicit access: your brain holds knowledge of something your mind cannot explicitly access (riding a bike, tying your shoes, typing on a keyboard).
- Chicken sexers (they need to figure out chicken genders) just look at their master and they get trained just looking at the rear end.
- Plane spotters: same, they just taught their apprentices how to figure out if friendly or enemy plane.
- There is a gap between knowledge and awareness.
- Ex: amnesiacs playing Tetris, they get better at the game but they don't know that game. (They dream of colorful falling blocks, but they have no idea why).
- If a person subconsciously hates fat people, they react faster if a button has "negative/overweight" rather than "positive/overweight".
- For things like religion, a mouse moves temporarily towards the "dislike" before going to "like" (socially acceptable response).
- People more often get married to others with the same first letter of their first name than would be expected. The mates somehow remind the spouses of themselves.
- Implicit egotism: Drinking the same tea but with the name similar to your name means you like the tea better.
- Those who thought they had the same birthday as Rasputin gave him more favorable ratings.
- People born on Feb 2 are more likely to move to cities with the number two in their names. 3/3 are overrepresented in Three Forks, Montana. 6/6 in Six Mile, South Carolina.
- Implicit egotism!

### Priming

- Implicit memory systems are separate from explicit memory systems.
- Amnesics: fill in primed words even if they are unaware of this.
- Mere exposure: Your implicit memory influences your interpretation of the world (which things you like, don't like, etc.) This is why it's okay to have bad publicity rather than no publicity.
- Illusion of truth: If you've heard it before, it's more likely to be true (regardless of whether that is actually true). This becomes a problem when people are repeatedly exposed to religious or political stuff.
- Hunches: the autonomic (fight-or-flight) nervous system was faster to pick up on a deck if it is good or bad (faster than the consciousness). It turns out that people need this gut feeling. Trying out the deck choosing with patients who had a damaged decision cortex means they were unable to make the right decisions with the decks even though they consciously realized which decks were bad.
- When something bad happens, the brain leverages the entire body (heart rate, gut, weakened muscles) to register that feeling. When the event is next pondered, the brain runs a simulation, relieving the physical feelings of the event. Those feelings bias the next decision making.
- People who could not distinguish faces consciously would have a skin conductance response to faces that were familiar.
- This is why flipping a coin helps when you can't decide between two options. Your gut feeling will tell you what to do when the coin lands. If you still can't decide, then use the coin.
- Tennis players extrapolate where the ball is going to go subconsciously. The tennis players are being programmed. Conscious parts of the brain train other parts of the machinery, establishing the goals and allocating the resources. They keep on incorporating the instructions until the movements become so ingrained they are no longer accessible.
- Consciousness: the long-term planner.
- Humans are flexibly intelligent. We can constantly fashion our neural circuits to match the tasks at hand.

- Speed.
  - Automatization permits fast decision making. You need to push slow consciousness to the back.
  - Energy efficiency: by not thinking about most things, you save energy. Garry Kasparov consumes 20 watts, Deep Blue consumes thousands of watts.
  - Proficient Tetris players have the game burned down into the circuitry of their systems. The player became better because the brain was quieter.
  - If you don't have the right tool for the job, create it.
- ***The irony is that a professional athlete's goal is to not think. The goal is to invest thousands of hours of training so that in the heat of the battle, the right maneuvers will come automatically, with no interference from consciousness.*** The skills need to be pushed down into the players' circuitry.

### The Kinds of Thoughts That are Thinkable

- The brain's circuits are designed to generate behavior that is appropriate to our survival. Things that taste good to us contain sugars and proteins and energy. We hate fecal matter because they contain harmful microbes.
- The things you are attracted to are usually because of evolutionary goals.
- You only pick up things that are enabled by your biology. The **umwelt** is the part you are able to see, and the **umgebung** is the bigger reality.
- We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.
- Synesthesic perceptions: involuntary, automatic, and consistent. There is increased cross talk among sensory areas in the brain.
- Synesthesia shows that reality is more subjective. ***Reality is not passively recorded by the brain. It is actively constructed by it.***
- Evolutionary psychology: why we solve problems faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors over 99% of our species' evolutionary history.
- Babies are not blank slates. They have neural programs specialized for reasoning about objects, physical causality, numbers, the biological world, beliefs/motivations of other individuals, social interactions. Babies turn toward face-like patterns when they are 10 minutes old. At two months, they express surprise if a solid object appears to pass through another object. Babies can also figure out if an adult made a mistake. Babies make assumptions about the world.
- Our brain has trouble with certain types of calculations, like conditional logic. The brain solves things faster if it's related to social interaction. Your psychology has evolved to solve social problems such as detecting cheaters, but not to be smart and logical in general.
- Instincts are different from automatized behavior because we were born with them. These behaviors represent ideas so useful that they become encoded into our DNA.
---
- Ex: a foal being able to walk minutes to hours after it's born. Ex: our neural circuits make it hard for us to get attracted to other animals.
- The cost of instincts: since they are faster and more energy efficient, we have lower access to them (instinct blindness). These programs are inaccessible to us not because they are unimportant, but because they're critical.
- Effortless acts: sexual attraction, fearing the dark, empathizing, arguing, becoming jealous, seeking fairness, finding solutions, avoiding incest, recognizing facial expressions.
- Beauty
  - Symmetry, structure = greater popularity, faster promotions, more successful career.
  - Until puberty, the faces of boys and girls are similar.
  - Rise in estrogen for girls = fuller lips, buttocks, breasts. Testosterone in boys = more prominent chin, larger nose, fuller jaw, muscles, broad shoulders.
  - On blondes: paler women more easily show signs of disease, while darker complexions can disguise their imperfections.
  - This is why you have plastic surgery.
  - Priming with "beer" or alcohol related words: rating photographs as more attractive.
  - Being in heat: female mammals give off clear signals when they are in heat. Women are considered to be most beautiful at the peak of fertility in her menstrual cycle (about 10 days before menses).
  - Tips by lap dancers: higher if at fertility date. Beauty is neurally preordained, but differences are really subtle. If you measure a beautiful person against an ugly person, facial feature changes would probably be really little.
  - Smell: Major histocompatibility complex gene. Females prefer the males with more dissimilar MHCs. Our noses influence our choices.
  - Vasopressin re: human relationship genes/tendency for infidelity. Choices, environment, plus this gene component.
  - Preprogrammed to lose interest in a sexual partner after the time required to raise a child has passed (about 4 years).
  - Babies are cute because of the evolutionary importance of adults taking care of babies.

## The Brain is a Team of Rivals

- "In came wine, out went a secret."
- Drinking alcohol while holding councils to prevent anyone from lying.
- Brains = collections of subagents.
- This is why you can do things like argue with yourself. Ex: being offered chocolate cake, there's a part of the brain that wants this rich energy source, and other parts that care about the negative consequences.
- The wiring diagram of the brain: some are higher-order, some monitor your internal state (lower-order).
- The issue re: trolley tracks moral dilemma. Diverting = reducing a bad situation to a less bad one. Pushing = using a man as a means to an end.
  - Another interpretation: if the problem is constructed so the man on the bridge is dropped with the use of a switch, people will vote to let him drop. Personal interaction activates the emotional networks. This changes the problem from an abstract, impersonal math problem into a personal, emotional decision.
  - Moral dilemma of pressing a button to get $1000, but someone you don't know dies.
- Christmas clubs: people want someone to stop them from spending their money. They knew that if they held on to their own money, they were likely to blow it.
  - Ulysses/the harpies story.
  - Negotiating a business deal with your future self: they know that their emotional selves will care more and more about it. They pit short- and long- term systems against each other.
  - Board re: letting the patient die: It's probably emotional, the future patient will usually find a way to regain her emotional footing. **When you cannot rely on your own rational systems, borrow someone else's.**
- Split-brain systems.
  -  Left hand grabs a different thing from the right hand when they see two different things.
  - Something to think about: about 3K years ago, the division of labor between left and right hemispheres began to break down. Possibly the origin of consciousness?
  - Hemispherectomy: One entire half of the brain is removed, as long as the surgery is performed on a child before he is about eight years old, it's going to be fine. (Checked Wikipedia to confirm).
- Memory: you can store memories twice?
  - Normal memories: hippocampus.
  - During frightening/traumatizing situations: the amygdala stores it differently: hard to erase, flashbulb like:(as commonly described by rape victims and war veterans). There are two memories of the same event.
- Cognitive reserve
  - There are some people who have apparently had Alzheimer's disease upon autopsy, but they never showed those symptoms when they were alive.
  - These people continued to challenge their brains into old age by staying alive in their careers, doing crossword puzzles.
  - By staying mentally vigorous, they built this cognitive reserve.
  - Their brains have protection against the symptoms.
  - Blindsight: someone who had a damaged part of her visual cortex, when asked for a shape, can still guess that shape correctly, even if she is convinced she can't see. Some part of the brain is still seeing, but it's just not the conscious part that depends on her visual cortex.
