# A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy

# Introduction A Plan for Living

What do you actually want in life? Of the things in life you might pursue, which is the thing you believe to be most valuable?

It's understandable that people don't know this (their grand goal in living), because our culture provides us with an endless stream of distractions so we don't have to. But you need a grand goal in living, because that leads to a coherent philosophy in life.

***Without this philosophy, there is a danger that you will mislive, and despite all your enjoyable activities, you will end up living a bad life. There's a danger that when you are on your deathbed, you'll realize that you wasted your chance at living.***

Even if you identify your grand goal in living, there is still a danger that you will mislive. If you lack an effective strategy for attaining your goal, it's unlikely that you will attain it. You also need a strategy for attaining your grand goal in living.

In the same way that we use financial experts to help us manage our wealth, we should use philosophers of life to help us manage our life.

This guy would help us think about our goals in living and about which of these goals are in fact worth pursuing.

Epicurus: "Vain is the word of a philosopher who does not heal any suffering of man. For just as there is no profit in medicine if it does not expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy either, if it does not expel the suffering of the mind."

While Stoicism is a philosophy, it has a significant psychological component. A life plagued with negative emotions (anger, anxiety, fear, grief, and envy) will not be a good life. The stoics therefore became acute observers of the workings of the human mind and developer techniques for preventing the onset of negative emotions and for extinguishing them when attempts at prevention failed.

Stoicism and Zen: They both stress the importance of contemplating the transitory nature of the world around us and the importance of mastering desire, to the extent that it is possible to do so.

*When I read the works of the Stoics, I encountered individuals who were cheerful and optimistic about life (even though they made it a point to spend time thinking about all the bad things that could happen to them) and who were fully capable of enjoying life’s pleasures (while at the same time being careful not to be enslaved by those pleasures).*

Stoics are not passive: they were fully engaged in life and worked hard to make the world a better place. Cato the Younger (soldier), Seneca (playwright/advisor/banker, Marcus Aurelius (emperor).

We are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless we can overcome our insatiability. How?

*The Stoics claims that many of the things we desire (fame and fortune) are not worth pursuing. We instead turn our attention to the pursuit of tranquility (not what you think, it's the absence of negative emotions)and what the Stoics called virtue (not what you think).*

Figuring out things we can control and things we can't control, recognize how easy it is for other people to disturb our tranquility, and we can practice Stoic strategies to prevent them from upsetting us.

Stoicism takes effort, in the same way that even "enlightened hedonism" takes effort. Enlightened hedonist: maximize the pleasure he experiences in his lifetime by discovering, exploring, and ranking sources of pleasure and investigating any untoward side effects they might have.(Unenlightened hedonism: spray and pray/short-term gratification.)

Not having a philosophy of life also has a cost: you pursue valueless things and will therefore waste your life.

# PART ONE The Rise of Stoicism

# ONE Philosophy Takes an Interest in Life

Sixth century BC: Pythagoras, Thales, Anaximander, Heracleitus, Confucius, the Buddha.

Diogenes (3rd century AD): Early Western philosophy had two branches, the Pythagoras/Italian/Epicurus branch, and the Ionian/Anaximander/Socrates branch.

Socrates → Plato (Academy), other schools. A lot! Socrates: integrated theoretical/speculative concerns into th context of his daily activities.

Sophist: someone who taught pupils to win arguments, either by appealing to reason, and by appealing to emotion.

Philosopher: eschewed appeals to emotion, and they also taught their pupils how to live well. Ex: Aristotle living in with Alexander the Great.

*Most religions, after telling adherents what they must do to be morally upstanding and get into heaven, leave it to them to determine what things in life are and aren't worth pursuing. These religions see nothing wrong with an adherent working hard so he can afford a huge mansion and an expensive sports car, as long as he doesn't break any laws doing so; nor do they see anything wrong with the adherent forsaking the mansion for a hut and forsaking the car for a bicycle.*

Stoa Poikile (Painted Porch), where Zeno of Citium/founder os the Stoic school of philosophy.

# TWO The First Stoics

Zeno of Citium (333-261 BC) was the first Stoic. The Cynics: advocated an extreme philosophical lifestyle. They were ascetics. The "Cynic Garb": one poor cloak.

The Cynics were renowned for their wit and wisdom. When, for example, someone asked what sort of woman a man should marry, Antisthenes replied that no matter what woman he chose for his wife, he would live to regret marrying: “If she’s beautiful, you’ll not have her to yourself; if she’s ugly, you’ll pay for it dearly.” Concerning our dealings with other people, he commented that “it is better to fall in with crows than with flatterers; for in the one case you are devoured when dead, in the other case while alive.” He also advised his listeners to “pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover your mistakes.”

Diogenes of Sinope: “the gods had given to men the means of living easily, but this had been put out of sight, because we require honeyed cakes, unguents and the like.” Such is the madness of men, he said, that they choose to be miserable when they have it in their power to be content. The problem is that “bad men obey their lusts as servants obey their masters,” and because they cannot control their desires, they can never find contentment.4

A status costs a lot (what does it do) while flour is cheap and can keep us alive.

Stoicism vs Cynicism: if you avoided all the good things, then were those things really good? Enjoy those good things, but prepare to give up those if you have to.

"A good life": virtue. Virtue means excellence as a human being, for the purpose that humans were designed. To live as we were designed to live. Which is...? Well, we are different from animals because we have the ability to reason. We have duties (honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends, be concerned with our countrymen). Living with perfect accordance with nature = being a wise man or a sage. A Stoic sage is free from vanity, for he is indifferent to good or evil report.

Don't let anything stop you from doing your duty. Drink wine, but do not do so to get drunk.

By the time of Marcus Aurelius, the last of the great Roman Stoics, logic and physics had essentially been abandoned: In the Meditations, we find Marcus congratulating himself for not having wasted time studying these subjects.

Romans: attainment of virtue and attainment of tranquility. A psychological tranquility marked by the absence of negative emotions. They recognized that fellow Romans would value tranquility over virtue.

# THREE Roman Stoicism

Roman Stoics: Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius.

Seneca: best writer. Musonius: pragmatic, suggested what to eat, what to wear, how they should behave, how they should conduct their sex life. Epictetus: analysis. Marcus: the thoughts of a practicing Stoic.

## Seneca the Younger

- Born 4-1 BC in Cordoba, Spain.
- Playwright, investment banker, tutor to Emperor Nero.
- Was banished to Corsica (41 AD), read, wrote, studied the island, and practiced his Stoicism.
- 49 AD: He was recalled and tutored Nero. "The most renowned citizen of his time."
 - He became wealthy, and this wealth gave rise to the charge that Seneca was a hypocrite.
- Seneca's death: "What has become of your stoicism?"

## Musonius Rufus

- Born around 30 AD.
- Didn't write down his thoughts but he had a pupil (Lucius) who took notes during lectures.
- Aligned himself with Nero's enemies and was exiled to Gyara in the Cyclades. (Seneca mentions it as one of the worst places on which to be exiled.)
- We should study philosophy, since otherwise, how could we hope to live well?
