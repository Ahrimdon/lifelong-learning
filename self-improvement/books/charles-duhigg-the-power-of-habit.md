# The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business

## Prologue

- Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.
- The US military is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history.

## Part One: The Habits of Individuals

### The Habit Loop: How Habits Work

- EP (Eugene): damaged medial temporal lobe, cells which scientists suspected was responsible for all sorts of cognitive tasks such as recall of the past and the regulation of some emotions.
  - He can remember everything, except the last three decades.
  - He can go to the bathroom, but he can't create a floor plan of the house.
  - He can take a walk and he never got lost even though he can't remember things.
- Same as HM (the guy who lost his memory from a lobotomy).
- Basal ganglia:
  - As each rat learned how to navigate the maze, its mental activity decreased. As the route become more and more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less.
  - The basal ganglia stores habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep. This is the process of chunking.
  - Think of driving. You hardly think about it nowadays. That routine occurs by habit.
- Habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.
- Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.
- Three step loop:
  - Cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.
  - The routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional.
  - The reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.
- This is why it's so hard to create exercise habits, or change what we it. By the same rule, if we learn to create new habits, we can force those bad tendencies into the background.
- Without habit loops, our brains would shut down, overwhelmed by the minutiae of daily life.
- People whose basal ganglia are damaged by injury or disease often become mentally paralyzed. They have trouble performing basic activities, such as opening a door or deciding what to eat.
- Without our basal ganglia, we lose access to the hundreds of habits we rely on every day.
- Eugene:
  - As long as the right cues are there, he can do his habits.
  - Habits are surprisingly delicate. If something was different with Eugene's cues, he would get lost in his walk.
- Families usually don't intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What happens is that a once a month pattern becomes a week, and then twice a week, etc.
  - This is why every McDonald's looks the same: so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines.
  - When a fast food restaurant closes down, the families that previously ate there will often start having dinner at home, rather than seek out an alternative location.
