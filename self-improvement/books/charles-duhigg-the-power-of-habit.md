# The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business

## Prologue

- Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.
- The US military is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history.

## Part One: The Habits of Individuals

### The Habit Loop: How Habits Work

- EP (Eugene): damaged medial temporal lobe, cells which scientists suspected was responsible for all sorts of cognitive tasks such as recall of the past and the regulation of some emotions.
  - He can remember everything, except the last three decades.
  - He can go to the bathroom, but he can't create a floor plan of the house.
  - He can take a walk and he never got lost even though he can't remember things.
- Same as HM (the guy who lost his memory from a lobotomy).
- Basal ganglia:
  - As each rat learned how to navigate the maze, its mental activity decreased. As the route become more and more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less.
  - The basal ganglia stores habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep. This is the process of chunking.
  - Think of driving. You hardly think about it nowadays. That routine occurs by habit.
- Habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.
- Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.
- Three step loop:
  - Cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.
  - The routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional.
  - The reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.
- This is why it's so hard to create exercise habits, or change what we it. By the same rule, if we learn to create new habits, we can force those bad tendencies into the background.
- Without habit loops, our brains would shut down, overwhelmed by the minutiae of daily life.
- People whose basal ganglia are damaged by injury or disease often become mentally paralyzed. They have trouble performing basic activities, such as opening a door or deciding what to eat.
- Without our basal ganglia, we lose access to the hundreds of habits we rely on every day.
- Eugene:
  - As long as the right cues are there, he can do his habits.
  - Habits are surprisingly delicate. If something was different with Eugene's cues, he would get lost in his walk.
- Families usually don't intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What happens is that a once a month pattern becomes a week, and then twice a week, etc.
  - This is why every McDonald's looks the same: so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines.
  - When a fast food restaurant closes down, the families that previously ate there will often start having dinner at home, rather than seek out an alternative location.

### 2: The Craving Brain. How to Create New Habits.

- Claude Hopkins: The guy when it came to advertising back in the 1900s.
  - Schlitz beer: "Bottles were cleaned with live steam (every other company used this method)."
  - Palmolive soap: Cleopatra washed with it.
  - Puffed Wheat: "Shot from guns."
- In the 1910s, people didn't brush their teeth that much. By the 1930s, half the American population had established brushing their teeth as a daily activity.
  - Hopkins created a craving.
  - Finding simple triggers to convince consumers to use his products. Quaker oats = 24 hour energy, but only if you had a bowl every morning.
  - Advertising toothpaste: a creator of beauty, to deal with cloudy film.
  - Cue: film on the teeth. Routine: brushing. Reward: nice teeth.
  - Obvious cue, then define the rewards.
  - **Creating new food habits requires a predetermined cue, such as planning menus in advance, and simple rewards for dieters when they stick to their intentions.**
  Febreze: the positioning was to rid themselves of embarrassing smells.
  - They tried to position it at first as something that would get rid of pet smells. It didn't sell at the start because people get desensitized to cat smells, and so they weren't noticed frequently enough to trigger a regular habit.
  - The people who were supposed to use it never smelled the odors that should have reminded them the living room needed a spritz.
- At first, Julio them monkey had an increased reward response when the reward came. After getting a lot of rewards, the reward response occurs before the juice arrives.
  - When the juice didn't arrive or was late or diluted, Julio would get angry and make unhappy noises, or become mopey. This is a new pattern: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn't receive it, a neurological pattern associated with desire and frustration kept inside his skull. If unsatisfied, it drove Julio to anger or depression.
  - One a monkey developed a habit (anticipated the reward), the distractions held no allure. The anticipation and sense of craving was so overwhelming that the monkeys stayed glued to the screens, the same way a gambler will play slots long after he's lost his winnings.
  - Habits are powerful because they crave neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we're not really aware they exist, so we're often blind to their influence.
  - There is nothing programmed into our brains that makes us see a box of donuts and makes us want it, but once our brain learns that a doughnut box contains yummy sugar and other carbohydrates, it will start anticipating the sugar high.
- Creating new habits: cue, routine, and reward.
  - Seeing a pack of Marlboros = smoking.
  - Notifications = anticipating the momentary distraction that opening an email provides.
  - When you disable the buzzing/the cue, people can work for hours without thinking to check their inboxes.
  - The brains of alcoholics, smokers, and over-eaters have changed as their cravings became ingrained.
- Starting exercise: because people had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stress in their lives. They continued (why it became a habit) was because of a specific reward they started to crave.
  - Accomplishment, sense of triumph from tracking their performances, and that self-reward was enough to make the physical activity into a habit.
  - On food: we're like monkeys. When we see the chicken or fries on the table, our brains begin anticipating that food, even if we're not hungry. Our brains are craving them. Frankly, I don't even like this kind of food, but it's hard to fight this urge.
  - ***This same process has let me create good habits. I work hard because I expect pride from a discovery. I exercise because I expect feeling good afterward. I just wish I could pick and choose better.***
- Repositioning Febreze: making it the activity you do after you clean a room.
  - Spraying freshly-made beds. Tagline: "Cleans life's smells."
  - It became an air freshener and finishing touch, once things are already clean.
  - Women then started craving the Febreze scent.
  - Park ranger: "She made us think that Febreze would succeed by providing a solution to a problem. But who wants to admit their house stinks?"
  - People crave a nice smell after they've spent thirty minutes cleaning.
- Pepsodent: It turns out that there were ads relating to beauty and brushing your teeth. Why was Pepsodent different?
  - Pepsodent created a craving. Unlike other pastes of the period, Pepsodent contained citric acid, as well as doses of mint oil and other chemicals. They are irritants that create a cool, tingling sensation on the tongue and gums.
  - When customers failed to use Pepsodent, they realized their mistake because they missed that cool, tingling sensation in their mouths.
  - When other companies discovered that, they started imitating. Even today, almost all toothpastes contain additives with the sole job of making your mouth tingle after you brush.
- New eating habit?
  - 78% of them ate breakfast every morning, but they also envisioned a specific reward for sticking with their diet: a bikini they wanted to wear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale each day.







- This thing is freaky. I've actually programmed junk food out of my system, but I now have craving for Cream Cheese Brownies from 7-11.
