# The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business

## Prologue

- Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.
- The US military is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history.

## Part One: The Habits of Individuals

### The Habit Loop: How Habits Work

- EP (Eugene): damaged medial temporal lobe, cells which scientists suspected was responsible for all sorts of cognitive tasks such as recall of the past and the regulation of some emotions.
  - He can remember everything, except the last three decades.
  - He can go to the bathroom, but he can't create a floor plan of the house.
  - He can take a walk and he never got lost even though he can't remember things.
- Same as HM (the guy who lost his memory from a lobotomy).
- Basal ganglia:
  - As each rat learned how to navigate the maze, its mental activity decreased. As the route become more and more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less.
  - The basal ganglia stores habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep. This is the process of chunking.
  - Think of driving. You hardly think about it nowadays. That routine occurs by habit.
- Habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.
- Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.
- Three step loop:
  - Cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.
  - The routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional.
  - The reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.
- This is why it's so hard to create exercise habits, or change what we it. By the same rule, if we learn to create new habits, we can force those bad tendencies into the background.
- Without habit loops, our brains would shut down, overwhelmed by the minutiae of daily life.
- People whose basal ganglia are damaged by injury or disease often become mentally paralyzed. They have trouble performing basic activities, such as opening a door or deciding what to eat.
- Without our basal ganglia, we lose access to the hundreds of habits we rely on every day.
- Eugene:
  - As long as the right cues are there, he can do his habits.
  - Habits are surprisingly delicate. If something was different with Eugene's cues, he would get lost in his walk.
- Families usually don't intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What happens is that a once a month pattern becomes a week, and then twice a week, etc.
  - This is why every McDonald's looks the same: so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines.
  - When a fast food restaurant closes down, the families that previously ate there will often start having dinner at home, rather than seek out an alternative location.

### 2: The Craving Brain. How to Create New Habits.

- Claude Hopkins: The guy when it came to advertising back in the 1900s.
  - Schlitz beer: "Bottles were cleaned with live steam (every other company used this method)."
  - Palmolive soap: Cleopatra washed with it.
  - Puffed Wheat: "Shot from guns."
- In the 1910s, people didn't brush their teeth that much. By the 1930s, half the American population had established brushing their teeth as a daily activity.
  - Hopkins created a craving.
  - Finding simple triggers to convince consumers to use his products. Quaker oats = 24 hour energy, but only if you had a bowl every morning.
  - Advertising toothpaste: a creator of beauty, to deal with cloudy film.
  - Cue: film on the teeth. Routine: brushing. Reward: nice teeth.
  - Obvious cue, then define the rewards.
  - **Creating new food habits requires a predetermined cue, such as planning menus in advance, and simple rewards for dieters when they stick to their intentions.**
  Febreze: the positioning was to rid themselves of embarrassing smells.
  - They tried to position it at first as something that would get rid of pet smells. It didn't sell at the start because people get desensitized to cat smells, and so they weren't noticed frequently enough to trigger a regular habit.
  - The people who were supposed to use it never smelled the odors that should have reminded them the living room needed a spritz.
- At first, Julio them monkey had an increased reward response when the reward came. After getting a lot of rewards, the reward response occurs before the juice arrives.
  - When the juice didn't arrive or was late or diluted, Julio would get angry and make unhappy noises, or become mopey. This is a new pattern: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn't receive it, a neurological pattern associated with desire and frustration kept inside his skull. If unsatisfied, it drove Julio to anger or depression.
  - One a monkey developed a habit (anticipated the reward), the distractions held no allure. The anticipation and sense of craving was so overwhelming that the monkeys stayed glued to the screens, the same way a gambler will play slots long after he's lost his winnings.
  - Habits are powerful because they crave neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we're not really aware they exist, so we're often blind to their influence.
  - There is nothing programmed into our brains that makes us see a box of donuts and makes us want it, but once our brain learns that a doughnut box contains yummy sugar and other carbohydrates, it will start anticipating the sugar high.
- Creating new habits: cue, routine, and reward.
  - Seeing a pack of Marlboros = smoking.
  - Notifications = anticipating the momentary distraction that opening an email provides.
  - When you disable the buzzing/the cue, people can work for hours without thinking to check their inboxes.
  - The brains of alcoholics, smokers, and over-eaters have changed as their cravings became ingrained.
- Starting exercise: because people had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stress in their lives. They continued (why it became a habit) was because of a specific reward they started to crave.
  - Accomplishment, sense of triumph from tracking their performances, and that self-reward was enough to make the physical activity into a habit.
  - On food: we're like monkeys. When we see the chicken or fries on the table, our brains begin anticipating that food, even if we're not hungry. Our brains are craving them. Frankly, I don't even like this kind of food, but it's hard to fight this urge.
  - ***This same process has let me create good habits. I work hard because I expect pride from a discovery. I exercise because I expect feeling good afterward. I just wish I could pick and choose better.***
- Repositioning Febreze: making it the activity you do after you clean a room.
  - Spraying freshly-made beds. Tagline: "Cleans life's smells."
  - It became an air freshener and finishing touch, once things are already clean.
  - Women then started craving the Febreze scent.
  - Park ranger: "She made us think that Febreze would succeed by providing a solution to a problem. But who wants to admit their house stinks?"
  - People crave a nice smell after they've spent thirty minutes cleaning.
- Pepsodent: It turns out that there were ads relating to beauty and brushing your teeth. Why was Pepsodent different?
  - Pepsodent created a craving. Unlike other pastes of the period, Pepsodent contained citric acid, as well as doses of mint oil and other chemicals. They are irritants that create a cool, tingling sensation on the tongue and gums.
  - When customers failed to use Pepsodent, they realized their mistake because they missed that cool, tingling sensation in their mouths.
  - When other companies discovered that, they started imitating. Even today, almost all toothpastes contain additives with the sole job of making your mouth tingle after you brush.
- New eating habit?
  - Exercising more: Add a cue and a reward after. Think about that endorphin rush you'll feel.
  - Allow yourself to anticipate the reward. Eventually, that craving will make it easier to push through the gym doors every day.
  - 78% of them ate breakfast every morning, but they also envisioned a specific reward for sticking with their diet: a bikini they wanted to wear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale each day.
- The problem with sunscreen: no foaming habit. They're hoping that sunscreen cues an expectation the same way the craving for a tingling mouth reminds us to brush our teeth. They've already used similar tactics in hundreds of other products. So the sunscreen people actually want to have foaming. Sodium laureth sulfate = used to make toothpaste foam more. There's no cleaning benefit, it's only job is to foam.
- Figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.

### 3: The Golden Rule of Habit Change

- ***To change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine.***
  - If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit.
  - Football: instead of having a ton of plays, they just have a few plays which they've practice again and again.
  - Bill Wilson, Alcoholics Anonymous.
    - 90 meetings in 90 days.
    - Spirituality/alcoholics can achieve sobriety by making a decision to turn our will and our lives over to God.
    - Someone has to create a list of all the triggers for their alcoholic urges: when you make a self-inventory, you're figuring out all the things that make you drink. And admitting to someone else all the bad things you've done is a good way of figuring out the moments where everything spiraled out of control.
    - What cravings drive your habit loop? Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. The physical effect of alcohol is often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.
    - AA: forces you to create new routines for what you do each night, instead of drinking. You can relax and talk through your anxieties at the meetings. The triggers and payoffs stay the same, it's just the behavior that changes.
  - You can put something in the basal ganglia that can stop cravings.
  - You have to rewire how you deal with anxiety. Once you incorporate new routines, the successes were dramatic.
  - Ex of rewiring: counting things. Like physically writing down or logging somewhere how many times you did it. Don't think of it as insane. Think of it as a rewiring mechanism. You want to force the reprogramming of your brain.
  - Ex: If you want to stop smoking, ask yourself, why are you smoking? Does it provide a burst of stimulation, a structure to your day, or a way to socialize?
- God/belief. Once people learned how to believe in something, that skill started spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they could change.
  - **Even if you give people better habits, it doesn't repair why they started drinking in the first place. Eventually, they'll have a bad day, and no new routine is going to make everything seem okay.**
  - "If it worked for that guy, I guess it can work for me."
- People remade their habits after a personal tragedy, such as a divorce or a life-threatening illness.
- Others change after they saw a friend go through something awful.
- Belief: Everything they had learned sticks, even at the most stressful moments.
  - IF you want to  change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group.
  - Change CAN happen.

### 4: Keystone Habits

- Keystone habits.
- "I'm happy to negotiate with you about anything. But there's one things I'm never going to negotiate with you, and that's safety. I don't ever want you to say that we haven't taken every step to make sure people don't get hurt. If you want to argue with me about that, you're going to lose."
- Habits:
  - Any time someone was injured, the unit president had to report it to O'Neill within twenty-four hours and present a plan for making sure the injury never happened again. And there was a reward: The only people who got promoted were those who embraced the system.
  - New communication systems were built that made it easier for the lowliest worker to get an idea to the loftiest executive, as fast as possible.
  - Splitting the "craving for promotion" with another thing.
  - **When people start habitually exercising, even as infrequently as once a week, they start changing other, unregulated patterns in their lives, often unknowingly. People who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work.**
  - Exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change. There's something about it that makes other good habits easier.
  - Eating dinner together:
    - Raise children with better homework skills, higher grades, greater emotional control, and more confidence.
    - Making your bed every morning is correlated with better productivity, a greater sense of well-being, and stronger skills at sticking with a budget.
- Small wins
  - Phelps: "Watch the videotape of the perfect race." "Put in the video tape!"
  - Concentrate on these tiny moments of success and build them into mental triggers. We worked them into a routine.
  - He actually tried swimming blind.
  - Small wins.
  - O'Neill and firing: "IT was clear what our values dictated. He got fired because he didn't report the incident, and so no one else had the opportunity to learn from it. Not sharing an opportunity to learn is a cardinal sin."

### 5: Starbucks and the Habit of Success.

- Starbucks: Willpower.
- To strengthen willpower, you can make it a habit. It looks like people with great self-control aren't working hard, because they've made it automatic.
- For Starbucks, willpower is more than an academic curiosity.
- Once people had the willpower to exercise, it touched everything.
- This is why you sign up kids for piano lessons or sports. When you learn to force yourself to practice for an hour or run fifteen laps, you start building self-regulatory strength.
- Businesses who employ entry-level workers have this problem: many fail because of a lack of self-discipline. If your parents or teachers have been telling you what to do your entire life, and suddenly, customers are yelling and your boss is too busy to give you guidance, it can be really overwhelming.
- "My goals for this week are...?"
- Putting a plan around inflection points would be the strongest. Cue + reward. Cue: "It's x time!" Reward: "Honey, I'm here!"
- Dealing with situations.
  - "When a customer is unhappy, my plan is to…"
  - LATTE Method: Listen to the customer, acknowledge their complaint, take action by solving the problem, thank them, and then explain why the problem occurred.
- Goal setting:
  - How are you going to study tonight? What are you going to do tomorrow? How do you know you're ready for your test?
- When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they're doing it for personal reasons, if they feel like it's a choice, it becomes less taxing. If you treat people like cogs, it takes a lot more willpower.

### 6: The Power of a Crisis

- Routines reduce uncertainty: it turns out that the habits of relief workers were critical, because without them, policy formation and implementation would be lost in a jungle of detail.
- Most workplaces are made up of fiefdoms where executives compete for power and credit. Divisions compete for resources and sabotage glory.
- Organizational habits: if you follow the established patterns and abide by the truce, then rivalries won't destroy the company, the profits will roll in, and eventually, everyone will get rich.
- Fashion designers:
  - You need basic creativity to start.
  - You need a system to find the best materials, and it's really complicated that without the right processes, a new company will get bogged down with logistics.
  - At the highest level, directors of the London underground were unlikely to trespass on the territory of another.
- Skipped this part.

### 7: How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do

- Marketers/psychologists: Place the fruits and vegetables at the front of the store. "If we started buying healthy shit, we're much more likely to buy bad shit afterwards."
- Since most of us turn to the right of the store, retailers fill the right side of the store with the most profitable products.
- Customers buy the same stuff, even if they don't like it.
- There is a LOT of personal data out there, and every company buys them.
- 2002: Target analytics had built programs to figure out which households had children and targeted them to buy bikes/scooters when it was near Christmas.
- For those buying bikinis in April, sunscreen in July and weight-loss books in December.
- Disruption for shopping habits: having a baby.
  - Ex: "She's probably pregnant", "She's probably buying for her pregnant friend"
- Preference for things that sound "familiar" = product of our neurology.
- How do you convince listeners to stick with songs such as "Hey Ya!" long enough for them to get familiarized? By making it seem familiar.
  - Playing it between familiar songs.
- 1940s: US losing meat supply because they were shipping it to Europe to support.
  - Department of Defense: Get Americans to eat organ meat.
  - To convince, they had to make the new foods look like old foods.
  - Ex: slip liver into meatloaf.
- Gyms: Make it a social thing.

## Part Three: The Habits of Societies

### 8: Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott

- Why did Rosa Parks's thing work?
  - Rosa Parks was deeply respected and embedded within her community.
  - She was like very accomplished and very respected both within whites and blacks.
  - The civil rights movement started because she had a large, diverse, and connected set of friends.
  - "If you were seen riding a bus on Monday, it would look bad."
- Movements work because they rely on social patterns that begin as the habits of friendship/communities.

### 9: The Neurology of Free Will/Are We Responsible for Our Habits?

- Too many stories. Skipped!

### Appendix

- The framework:
  - Routine, rewards, cue, plan.
- Possible trick re: reward
  - Fifteen minute alarm to determine the reward you're craving. If you're craving something else, then it's not that you're craving. You might be craving something else.
- Cues:
  - Location, time, emotional state, other people, immediately preceding action.
  - When you are trying to figure out the cue for "going to the cafeteria and buying a chocolate chip cookie" habit, write down these:
    - Where are you?
    - What time is it?
    - What's your emotional state?
    - Who else is around?
    - What action preceded the urge?
    - In his case, he now knew that the reward he was seeking was a temporary distraction.
