## Daring Greatly: How the Courage to be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead

> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better."

> "The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly..."

### Introduction: My Adventures in the Arena

- Social work: not about fixing, it's about contextualizing and leaning in.
- Social work is all about leaning into the discomfort of ambiguity and uncertainty, and holding open an empathic space so people can find their own way. In a word, messy.
- "What do the people who are the most resilient to shame, who believe in their worthiness (the whole-hearted) have in common?

- Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, "No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough. I am enough. It's going to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn't change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging.
  - We're hardwired for connection, it's what gives us purpose and meaning to our lives. The absence of love, belonging, and connection always leads to suffering.
  - There are people who feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging simply because they are worthy of love and belonging. They don't have easier lives, but in the midst of all these struggles, they have developed practices that enable them to hold on to the belief that they are worthy of love, belonging, and even joy.
  - A strong belief in our worthiness doesn't just happen--it's cultivated when we understand the guideposts as choices and daily practices.
  - They want to live a life defined by courage, compassion, and connection.
  - The wholehearted identify vulnerability as the catalyst for courage, compassion, and connection.
- Vulnerability is the core, the heart, and the center of meaningful human experiences.
- Emotional accessibility = bad for credibility?
- How do you risk being really vulnerable and tell stories about your journey without looking like a total flake?
- Perfection doesn't exist, and what makes children happy doesn't always prepare them to be courageous, engaged adults.
- **What we know matters, but who we are matters more. Being rather than knowing requires showing up and letting ourselves be seen. It requires us to dare greatly, to be vulnerable.** The first step of that journey is understanding where we are, what we're up against, and where we need to go.

### Chapter 1: Scarcity: Looking Inside out Culture of "Never Enough"

- Narcissism? In music, they found a decrease in usages of "we" and "us" and an increase in "I" and "me".
- From the vulnerability lens: I see the shame-based fear of being ordinary.
- Never feeling extraordinary enough to be noticed, to be loveable, to belong, or to cultivate a sense of purpose.
- Scarcity: the never-enough problem. (Never good, perfect, thin, powerful, successful, smart...)
- Scarcity thrives in a culture where everyone is hyper-aware of lack.



## Notes

- On wholehearted living: I think this is an exercise that I have to do everyday, seeing as it's so hard to be surrounded by extremely smart and accomplished people that you feel that you have to bring you A-game.
- Especially in open source, writing, programming, what you do (creative work) can always be critiqued. People can always say something bad about the thing.
