# Part One The Cognitive Revolution

- 70K YA: Cultures. 12K YA: Agriculture. 500 YA: Science.
- 2.5M YA: Animals like modern humans.
  - 2M YA: Youths, elders wanting to be left alone, competed for status and power.
- Genus: species that evolved from a common ancestor.
- Australopithecus: which means 'Southern Ape'. 2M YA: left the homeland to go to N Afria, Europe, Asia. Different distinct species.
- Europe, W Asia: Neanderthals, bulkier and muscular than the Sapiens.
- E Asia: Homo erectus, upright man, 2M YA.
- Java: Homo soloensis, "The Man from the Solo Valley".
- Flores, Indonesia: good for dwarves. Big people, who needs a lot of food, died first. Poor in resources. Height of only one meter and weighed no more than twenty-five kg. Stone tools, can hunt elephants (those were also small).
- 2010, Siberia: Homo denisova was discovered.
- Other species came about, until Homo sapiens.
- They were all of genus Homo. Massive, dwarves, hunters, plant-gatherers. All were human beings.
- 100K YA: At least 6 different species of man.

# The Cost of Thinking

- Average brain size for 60kb: 200 cubic cm. Earlies men/women: 600 cubic cm. Sapiens: 1.2K to 1.4K cubic cm. Neanderthals: bigger. Cats: bigger.
- A big brain = big drain on the body. Hard to carry around, hard to fuel. 2-3% body weight, 25% body energy.
  - We are weaker than chimps.
  - What drove forward the evolution of the massive human brain over 2M years (where human neural networks just grew)? IDK.
  - Walking upright on two legs, to see things in the savannah. Increased concentration of nerves in the palms and fingers. Tool production: 2.5M YA.
  - Con to walking upright: back-aches, stiff necks.
- For women, the upright gait required narrower hips, constricting the birth canal (as babies' heads were getting bigger and bigger).
  - Women who gave birth earlier fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection favors earlier births.
  - Having helpless infants meant evolution favored those capable of forming strong social ties. Since we are also born underdeveloped, we can be educated and socialized to a far greater extent than any other animal.
- Why then do we suck re: being hunted by animals? We used to just eat plants and stalk small animals.
  - Early stone tools were used for cracking bones to get to the marrow. Why? Because you need to wait till lions and hyenas are finished with carcasses.
  - 400K YA: Hunting large game. 100K YA/sapiens: we go to the top of the food chain.
  - Because our leap was so fast, the ecosystem had no time to adjust.

## A Race of Cooks

- Fire: earliest was probably 800K YA. 300K YA, erectus, Neanderthals, sapiens ancestors were using.
- Cooking: this allowed us to eat wheat, rice, and potatoes. It's also easier for us to eat things once they are cooked.
- Evolution: we can eat more kinds of food, devote less time to eating, and then make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines.
- Fire means humans gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force.
- Fire is not limited by the form, structure, or strength of the human body.

## Our Brothers' Keepers

- 70K YA: East Africa â†’ Arabia, then Eurasia.
- When they got to Europe: Neanderthals.
- Neanderthals used tools, first, hunted, took care of their sick.
- Interbreeding theory: Breeding with Neanderthals, and breeding with Erectus (China/Korea).
  - Possible, 1-4% human DNA is Neanderthal. 6% human DNA in Melansians & Aboriginal Australians = Denisovan.
- Replacement theory: Killing, genetic gulf/infertile children.
- When Sapiens arrive to a new location, the native population becomes extinct.

# 2 The Tree of Knowledge

- In the first recorded encounter between Sapiens and Neanderthals, the Neanderthals won.
  - About 100,000 years ago, some Sapiens groups migrated north to the Levant, which was Neanderthal territory, but failed to secure a firm footing.
  - It might have been due to nasty natives, an inclement climate, or unfamiliar local parasites. Whatever the reason, the Sapiens eventually retreated, leaving the Neanderthals as masters of the Middle East.
- This poor record of achievement has led scholars to speculate that the internal structure of the brains of these Sapiens was probably different from ours. Limited cognitive abilities.
- At around 70K YA, when Sapiens left Africa again, things changed.
  - 45K YA: Crossing the open sea and landing in Australia.
  - 70K-35K YA: Boats, lamps, bows/arrows, needles (for clothing), religion, commerce, art, social stratification.
  - Cognitive revolution, possibly due to language?

- Our language
  - *Zoologists have identified one call that means, 'Careful! An eagle!' A slightly different call warns, 'Careful! A lion!' When researchers played a recording of the first call to a group of monkeys, the monkeys stopped what they were doing and looked upwards in fear. When the same group heard a recording of the second call, the lion warning, they quickly scrambled up a tree.*
  - We can produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can say more specialized things.
  - Gossiping/social cooperation. We are able to know things abut the tribe.
- ***Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it's the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.***
  - Myths: biblical creation, nationalism. This allows us to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
