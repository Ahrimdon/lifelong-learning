# Little Bets

- Developing an hour-long act takes even top-comedians from six months to a year.
- Ingenious ideas almost never spring into people's minds fully formed, they emerge through a rigorous experimental discovery process.
- Ex: PageRank came from the idea of the more citations a paper had, the better it was. Targeted ads.
- Ex: Amazon. Many efforts lead to dead ends, but they have to keep experimenting.
  - Ultimate breakthroughs: AWS and Amazon stores.
- Ex: Starbucks stores are modeled after Italian coffee houses.

- Approach:
  - Experiment: Learn by doing. Fail quickly to learn fast.
  - Play: A playful, improvisational, and humorous atmosphere quiets our inhibitions when ideas are incubating or newly hatched, and prevents creative ideas from being snuffed out or prematurely judged.
  - Immerse: Take time to get out into the world to gather fresh ideas and insights, in order to understand deeper human motivations and desires, and absorb how things work from the ground up.
  - Define: Use insights gathered throughout the process to define specific problems and needs before solving them.
  - Reorient: Be flexible in pursuit of larger goals and aspirations.
  - Iterate: Repeat, refine, and test frequently armed with better insights, information, and assumptions.

## Big Bets vs Little Bets

- Cold War: Soviets were really by the book, in Afghanistan/Iraq, it was guerilla warfare. Instead of fighting with info, the army must fight to get info. Soldiers actually have to be immersed with the civilian population.
- Affordable loss:
  - Determine in advance what are you willing to lose, rather than calculating expected gains.
  - Successful entrepreneurs are comfortable being adaptable in pursuit of their larger goals because they are progressively building their means.
- Pixar: Started with short films before it made Toy Story.
  - The quality of work was what made Pixar the front runner for animation.

## Growth Mindset

- Vinod Khosla:"I believe in bumbling around long enough to not give up at things. Eventually success comes your way, because you tried to fail in every possibly way, the only way that's left is the one successful way, and that usually comes last."
- Michael Jordan: Really bad at 3s in his first few years.

## Failing Quickly to Learn Fast

- Every good writer starts with "shitty first drafts". Just get it down on paper, write like a child, whatever comes to your mind.

## The Genius of Play

- Plussing: Building upon and improving ideas without using judgmental language. Creating an atmosphere were ideas are constantly being plussed. "What if we..." "What if it was..."

## Problems are the New Solutions

## Questions are The New Answers

- Ideas at Pixar usually come from its employees' worldly observations and experiences.
- Field research to do things.
- Seinfeld: Relies on keen observations to come up with new material: observing random things like Starbucks, construction sites, nose hairs (?), and advertising slogans.
- John Legend: A database of details noted from his travels/relationships, as well as movies, TV, books, from all aspects of his life.
- Be open to experience and creativity.
- Status quo: people exhibit strong "loss aversion".
- Jeff Bezos: "Why not?"
- Targeting the right problems, ex: people in Mexico wanted their laundry to have suds to show that it was working.

## Learning a Little from a Lot

- Great leaders need to be able to actually listen.
- Lucky people pay more attention to what's going on around them than unlucky people. Lucky people tend to be open to opportunities that come along spontaneously, whereas unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine.
- **Lucky people are effective at building secure, and long-lasting, attachments with the people they meet. They are easy to know and most people like them. They tend to be trusting and form close relationships with others. As a result, they often keep in touch with a much larger number of friends and colleagues than unlucky people. And time and again, this network of friends helps promote opportunity in their lives.**
- Being in the right place and at the right time is actually all about being in the right state of mind. Lucky people increase their odds of chance encounters or experiences by interacting with a large number of people.

## Learning a Lot from a Little

- Extreme users can usually foreshadow the needs of other people.
- Lead users: I sent out this book to literary agents and fellow authors.

## Small Wins

## Conclusion

- Cranium: Why wasn't there a game where everyone could win. On the plane home, he sketched out the idea for a game with something for everyone.
