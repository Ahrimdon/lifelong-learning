# So Good They Can't Ignore You

- The Mu Koan.
- Fulfilling your dream to become a full-time Zen practitioner doesn't magically make your life wonderful.
- ***The importance of ability.***
- Mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness.
- Career capital.

## Rule #1: Don't Follow Your Passion.

### Chapter One: The "Passion" Of Steve Jobs

- The passion hypothesis: Passion â†’ Job that matches this passion.
- Steve Jobs: studied Western history/dance/Eastern mysticism. Atari/India.
- If he only decided to pursue he loved, he'd probably be a Zen teacher. Apple was born because of a "small-time" scheme that took off.
- At some point, he grew passionate about Apple.

### Chapter Two: Passion is Rare

- "People are in a rush to start their lives. I set goals for myself at being the best I could be at whatever I did."
- ***Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.***
- Conclusion #1: Career Passions Are Rare. Almost all passions are like sports or art-related.
- Conclusion #2: Passion Takes Time. Job = way to pay the bills, career = path towards better work, calling = work that's important part of your life and a vital part of your identity. The happiest employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but those who have been long enough to be come good at what they do.
- Conclusion #3: Passion is a side effect of mastery. Autonomy, competence, relatedness (autonomy, mastery, purpose by Dan Pink). Note: no "matching work to pre-existing passions".

### Chapter Three: Passion is Dangerous

- It's never like "here's a case of someone following their passion, so follow your passion works."

## Rule #2: Be So Good They Can't Ignore You

### Chapter Four: The Clarity of the Craftsman

- Craftsman: A focus on what value you're producing in your job, over Passion: a focus on what value the job offers you.
- Jordan Tice: "Be so good they can't ignore you." Steve Martin: Ten years for his new act to cohere, but when it did, he became a monster success. Eventually you get to be so experienced that a confidence comes out.
- "The tape doesn't lie." If you're not focusing on becoming so good that they can't ignore you, you're going to be left behind.
- **Tice is willing to grind out long hours with little recognition, but that's because it's in service to something he's obviously passionate about and has been for a long time.**
- Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you'll build a compelling career.

### Chapter Five: The Power of Career Capital

- Traits that Define Great Work
  - Creativity.
  - Impact.
  - Control.
- We know that these traits are valuable. So you need to supply something rare and valuable to get something in return.
- Career Capital Theory of Great Work
  - The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.
  - You need rare and valuable skills to offer in return.
  - The craftsman mindset of "relentless focus to be so good they can't ignore you" is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset, if your goal is to create work you love.
- There are some jobs where you can apply career capital theory more than others.
- ***Disqualifiers:***
  - The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
  - The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
  - The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.

### Chapter Six: The Career Capitalists

- Career capital: consistently seeking feedback and obsessively honing his craft. He was working on three or four scripts at a time, always seeking feedback for how he can get better.
- After each working experience, he'd stick his head up to see who was interested at his new capital, and then jump at whatever opportunity seemed most promising.
- He tracks things to the quarter-hour per day via a spreadsheet.

### Chapter Seven: Becoming a Craftsman

- Stretching, and receiving immediate feedback.
- Serious study/using teachers to help identify and then eliminate weaknesses. Chess grandmasters spent five more hours dedicated to serious study than those who plateaued at an intermediate level.
- Deliberate practice.
  - Stretch your ability by taking on projects that were way beyond his current comfort zone. He then obsessively sought feedback on everything: even if, looking back now, he's humiliated at the quality of scripts he was sending out.
  - Spreadsheet: being intentional about things. Better to work on things you really need to do rather than triviality. The important stuff finds its way to him, but on his schedule.
  - **Focus on what's important, not on what's immediate.**

#### Five Habits of a Craftsman

- Decide which capital market you're in.
  - The top blogs in this space have really clunky designs, but they all inspire their readers.
  - You then focus on something your readers really care about.
- Identify your capital type.
  - Look for opportunities to build capital that are already open to you.
- Define "good".
- Stretch and destroy.
  - **Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable.**
  - Pushing past what's comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate practice story, the other part is embracing honest feedback, even if it destroys what you thought was good.
  - Okay to be humiliated, but the continuous and harsh feedback he received accelerated the growth of his ability.
- Be patient.
  - You have to look xx years into the future for the payoff.

## Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion

### Chapter Eight: The Dream Job Elixir

- He didn't decide one that that he was passionate about produce. By the time he made the plunge into full-time farming, he had been acquiring relative career capital for close to a decade.
- Control: It's about living life on your own terms.
- Look for companies embracing Results-Only Work Environment.
- Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.

### Chapter Nine: The First Control Trap

- Lifestyle designers: some of them skip the part where they build a stable means to support their unconventional lifestyle.

### Chapter Ten: The Second Control Trap

- One you have enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, your employer will fight your efforts to gain more autonomy.

### Chapter Eleven: Avoiding the Control Traps

- You should only pursue a bid for more control if you have evidence that it's something that people are willing to pay you for.
- Derek Sivers: Do what people are willing to pay for.
- Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable.
- The Law of Financial Viability: **When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it.**

## Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big

### Chapter Twelve: The Meaningful Life of Pardis Sabeti

- Her happiness comes from the fact that she built here career on a clear and compelling mission, something that not only gives meaning to her work but provides the energy needed to embrace life beyond the lab.
- Unifying focus for your career: What should I do with my life? Missions are powerful because they focus your energy towards a useful goal, and this in turn maximizes your impact on your world.

### Chapter Thirteen: Missions Require Capital

- "Where Good Ideas Come From": Steven Johnson says that people discovering things at the same time are frequent in the history of science.
- Adjacent possible: We take the ideas we've inherited and we combine them together into some new shape. Anyone looking at the same spot would notice the same innovations starting to happen.
- To identify a mission for your working life, you must first get to the cutting edge, the only place where these missions become visible.
- Rule #4: Advance to the cutting edge in a field, requiring you to focus on a narrow collection of subjects, then go after it with a big action.

### Chapter Fourteen: Missions Require Little Bets

- Use small and achievable projects (little bets) to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.

### Missions Require Marketing

- Find projects that satisfy the law of remarkability (an idea that inspires people to remark about it).
- Purple Cow: "You're either remarkable or invisible."
- Open source to get popular. Also spread the word via user groups.
- ***The Law of Remarkability: For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways: it should compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.***

## Conclusion

- Feynman: He had an above average IQ of 125, but his compulsion to tear down important papers and concepts until he could understand the concepts really built him.
- Focusing my attention on a bottom-up understanding of my own field's most difficult results would be a good first step toward my career capital.

### How I Applied Rule #2

- Time structure: "I am going to work on this for one hour, I don't care if I faint from the effort or I make no progress, but for the next hour, this is my whole world."
  - This took, on average, ten minutes for the waves of resistance to die down.
  - Having a time limit helped ensure that the difficulty was manageable.

- Information structure: A way of capturing the results of my hard focus in a useful form.
  - I built a proof map that captured the dependencies between the different pieces of the proof.
  - Then I self-administered quizzes to myself to memorize the key definitions the proof used.
  - This was a relatively easy task, but it still took concentration.
  - Big guns: proof summaries. I forced myself to take each lemma and walk through each step of its proofs, filling in the missing steps. That I had already spent time on easier tasks on the paper built up enough momentum to help push me forward.

- The new mindset this thing introduced: strain was good. Instead of seeing this discomfort as a sensation to avoid, I began to understand it the same way that a body builder understands muscle burn: it's a sign that you're doing something right.
- Large-scale paper deconstructions:
  - Research bible. Once a week, I require myself to summarize in my "bible" a paper I think might be relevant to my research. This summary must include a description of the result, how it compares to a previous work, and the main strategies used to obtain it.
  - Hour tally: The total number of hours I've spent doing deliberate practice. By having these hour counts, I'm motivated to find new ways to fit more deliberate practice into my schedule.
  - Theory Notebook: I bought the most expensive notebook I could find at the MIT bookstore.
- Forced strain was important. Make things craft-centric. Getting better and better at what I did became what mattered most, and getting better required the strain of deliberate practice.

### How I Applied Rule #3

- Choosing a relatively new program (Georgetown): "In a growing program, you'll always have a say."

### How I Applied Rule #4

- True missions require career capital, which requires patience.
- Also, always scan the adjacent possible in the field.

- Top Level: The Tentative Research Mission. "To do..." To identify this mission description, I had to first acquire career capital in my field. I've published and read enough distributed algorithm results to know there's great potential in moving this body of theory to new settings.
- Bottom Level: Background Research. Every week, I expose myself to something new about my field. Papers, talks, meetings. I require myself to add a summary, in my own words, to my growing "research bible".
  - I also try to carve out one walk each day for free-form thinking about the ideas turned up by this background research.
  - Access to new ideas and to the "liquid networks" that facilitate their mixing and matching often provides the catalyst for breaking through new ideas.
- Middle level: Exploratory projects.
  - Use small projects that I call little bets. A little bet has the following characteristics. I track my hours spent on these bets in the hour tally.
  - I use the concrete feedback it generate to guide my research going forward. This feedback tells me whether a given project should be aborted and, if not, what direction is most promising to explore next.

### Final Thoughts: Working Hard Trumps Finding the Right Work

- Thomas's experience at the monastery had freed him from the escapist thoughts of fantasy jobs that had once dominated his mind.
- He was able instead to focus on the tasks he was given, and on accomplishing them well.
- ***Working right trumps finding the right work.*** You don't need to have a perfect job to find occupational happiness, you just need a better approach to the work already available to you.
