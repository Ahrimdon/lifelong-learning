# So Good They Can't Ignore You

- The Mu Koan.
- Fulfilling your dream to become a full-time Zen practitioner doesn't magically make your life wonderful.
- ***The importance of ability.***
- Mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness.
- Career capital.

## Rule #1: Don't Follow Your Passion.

### Chapter One: The "Passion" Of Steve Jobs

- The passion hypothesis: Passion â†’ Job that matches this passion.
- Steve Jobs: studied Western history/dance/Eastern mysticism. Atari/India.
- If he only decided to pursue he loved, he'd probably be a Zen teacher. Apple was born because of a "small-time" scheme that took off.
- At some point, he grew passionate about Apple.

### Chapter Two: Passion is Rare

- "People are in a rush to start their lives. I set goals for myself at being the best I could be at whatever I did."
- ***Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.***
- Conclusion #1: Career Passions Are Rare. Almost all passions are like sports or art-related.
- Conclusion #2: Passion Takes Time. Job = way to pay the bills, career = path towards better work, calling = work that's important part of your life and a vital part of your identity. The happiest employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but those who have been long enough to be come good at what they do.
- Conclusion #3: Passion is a side effect of mastery. Autonomy, competence, relatedness (autonomy, mastery, purpose by Dan Pink). Note: no "matching work to pre-existing passions".

### Chapter Three: Passion is Dangerous

- It's never like "here's a case of someone following their passion, so follow your passion works."

## Rule #2: Be So Good They Can't Ignore You

### Chapter Four: The Clarity of the Craftsman

- Craftsman: A focus on what value you're producing in your job, over Passion: a focus on what value the job offers you.
- Jordan Tice: "Be so good they can't ignore you." Steve Martin: Ten years for his new act to cohere, but when it did, he became a monster success. Eventually you get to be so experienced that a confidence comes out.
- "The tape doesn't lie." If you're not focusing on becoming so good that they can't ignore you, you're going to be left behind.
- **Tice is willing to grind out long hours with little recognition, but that's because it's in service to something he's obviously passionate about and has been for a long time.**
- Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you'll build a compelling career.

### Chapter Five: The Power of Career Capital

- Traits that Define Great Work
  - Creativity.
  - Impact.
  - Control.
- We know that these traits are valuable. So you need to supply something rare and valuable to get something in return.
- Career Capital Theory of Great Work
  - The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.
  - You need rare and valuable skills to offer in return.
  - The craftsman mindset of "relentless focus to be so good they can't ignore you" is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset, if your goal is to create work you love.
- There are some jobs where you can apply career capital theory more than others.
- ***Disqualifiers:***
  - The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
  - The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
  - The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.

### Chapter Six: The Career Capitalists

- Career capital: consistently seeking feedback and obsessively honing his craft. He was working on three or four scripts at a time, always seeking feedback for how he can get better.
- After each working experience, he'd stick his head up to see who was interested at his new capital, and then jump at whatever opportunity seemed most promising.
- He tracks things to the quarter-hour per day via a spreadsheet.

### Chapter Seven: Becoming a Craftsman

- Stretching, and receiving immediate feedback.
- Serious study/using teachers to help identify and then eliminate weaknesses. Chess grandmasters spent five more hours dedicated to serious study than those who plateaued at an intermediate level.
- Deliberate practice.
  - Stretch your ability by taking on projects that were way beyond his current comfort zone. He then obsessively sought feedback on everything: even if, looking back now, he's humiliated at the quality of scripts he was sending out.
  - Spreadsheet: being intentional about things. Better to work on things you really need to do rather than triviality. The important stuff finds its way to him, but on his schedule.
  - **Focus on what's important, not on what's immediate.**

#### Five Habits of a Craftsman

- Decide which capital market you're in.
  - The top blogs in this space have really clunky designs, but they all inspire their readers.
  - You then focus on something your readers really care about.
- Identify your capital type.
  - Look for opportunities to build capital that are already open to you.
- Define "good".
- Stretch and destroy.
  - **Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable.**
  - Pushing past what's comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate practice story, the other part is embracing honest feedback, even if it destroys what you thought was good.
  - Okay to be humiliated, but the continuous and harsh feedback he received accelerated the growth of his ability.
- Be patient.
  - You have to look xx years into the future for the payoff.

## Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion

### Chapter Eight: The Dream Job Elixir

- He didn't decide one that that he was passionate about produce. By the time he made the plunge into full-time farming, he had been acquiring relative career capital for close to a decade.
- Control: It's about living life on your own terms.
- Look for companies embracing Results-Only Work Environment.
- Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.

### Chapter Nine: The First Control Trap

- Lifestyle designers: some of them skip the part where they build a stable means to support their unconventional lifestyle.

### Chapter Ten: The Second Control Trap

- One you have enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, your employer will fight your efforts to gain more autonomy.

### Chapter Eleven: Avoiding the Control Traps

- You should only pursue a bid for more control if you have evidence that it's something that people are willing to pay you for.
- Derek Sivers: Do what people are willing to pay for.
