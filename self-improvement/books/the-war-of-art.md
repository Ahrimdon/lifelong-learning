## The War of Art

- What I do: How many pages have I produced? I don't care. Are they any good? I don't even think about it. All that matters is I've put in my time and hit it with all I've got. All that counts is that for this day, for this session, I have overcome Resistance.
- The life we live, the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.
- It was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.

### Resistance's Greatest Hits

- These actions elicit Resistance:
  - The pursuit of any calling in the creative arts.
  - The launching of any entrepreneurial venture or enterprise, for profit or otherwise.
  - Diet, abs.
  - Spiritual advancement.
  - Something to overcome an unwholesome habit.
  - Education.
  - Courage.
  - Anything to help others.
  - Commitment of the heart.
  - Taking a stand.
- **Any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower, any of these will elicit Resistance.**

- Resistance is invisible.
- Resistance is internal.
- Resistance is insidious. It will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. Resistance has no conscience, and if you take it at its word, you deserve everything you get.
- Resistance is implacable, it cannot be reasoned with.
- Resistance is impersonal. It doesn't know who you are and doesn't care.
- Resistance is infallible.
- Resistance is universal.
- Resistance never sleeps.
- Resistance plays for keeps. When we fight it , we are in a war to the death.
- Resistance is fueled by fear.
- Resistance only opposes when we move from a lower sphere to a higher one. It kicks in when we week to pursue a calling in the arts, launch an innovative enterprise, evolve to a higher station morally, ethically, spiritually.
- Resistance is most powerful at the finish line.
- Resistance recruits allies (other people) who want to sabotage you. Because they are also struggling against their own Resistance.

- Procrastination: We don't say "I'm never going to write my symphony", we say "I'll write my symphony tomorrow."
- Procrastination is a habit. There is never a habit when you are without the power to alter our destiny.
- If you feel hollow after sex, drugs, shopping, masturbation, TV, gossip, alcohol, sugar, this was because of Resistance. It knows it has distracted us with a cheap, easy fix and kept us from doing our work.
- Getting into trouble: a cheap way of getting attention. Anything that draws attention to ourselves is a manifestation of Resistance. The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing here work.
- Creating soap opera in our lives is a symptom of Resistance.
- Self-medication: some diseases can be real, but they can also be resistance.
- Victimization: a form of passive aggression, you want to be gratified by your experience/wanting to be rescued. Casting yourself as a victim is the antithesis of doing your work.

### Resistance and Fundamentalism

- You will not cure your restlessness by contributing your income to Bullshit, Inc., but only by doing our work.
- Artist: freedom, self-confidence, hope for the future, his faith is that humankind is advancing. Fundamentalist: in his view, humanity has fallen from a higher state. The truth is not out there awaiting revelation, it has already been revealed.
  - Fundamentalism is the philosophy of the powerless, the conquered, the displaced, and the dispossessed.
  - In desperate times, races need a doctrine that restored hope and pride. Nazis, Islamic fundamentalism, etc. Fundamentalists cannot stand freedom. He cannot find his way into the future, so he retreats to the past.
  - Fundamentalism and art are exclusive. This is why fundamentalists destroy stuff. He creates this image of Satan, the image of a foe, to which he defines and gives meaning to his own life.
  - Humanist: humankind is called up to co-create the world with God. This is why he values human life so highly. In his view, things do progress, life does evolve, each individual has value, at least potentially, in advancing this cause. The fundamentalist cannot conceive of this. In his society, dissent is not just crime but apostasy.
  - You can't just condemn fundamentalists, because they've had a different life. They probably are not ready for freedom. Those who do not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.


- Resistance/criticism: You might be criticizing people out of Resistance. When we see others beginning to live their authentic selves, it drives us crazy if we have not lived out our own.
- Realized individuals almost never criticize others. If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement.
- Resistance/fear: It's good to be fearful, because the more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.
  - Professionals turn down roles they've done before. If you're not afraid, then why waste your time?
- Resistance/love. If you feel Resistance, there's love there too. The more Resistance you experience, the more important your unmanifested project is to you, and the more gratification you get from doing it.
- Success, like happiness comes as a by-product of work. The professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like.
- Isolation: **When I'm writing a book, even without characters, I'm imagining the reader, whom I conjure as an aspiring artist much like my younger self, to whom I hope to impart a little starch and inspiration and prime.**
- What is "healing"? Healing from what? **Resistance knows that the more psychic energy we expend dredging and re-dredging the tired injustices of our lives, the less juice we have to do work.**
- Rationalization: a way for us to justify why we shouldn't work. These rationalizations usually don't mean shit.
- Resistance gets beaten!

### Book Two: Combatting Resistance

- Amateur vs professional: the professional plays full-time. The professional is there seven days a week. They commit to it full-time.
- "I write only when inspiration strikes, fortunately it strikes every morning at 9:00."
- Being miserable: marines love to be miserable. Marines derive a perverse satisfaction from having colder chow, crappier equipment, and higher casualty rates than any other outfit. They despise those who don't know how to be miserable. You want to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier, because this is war, and war is hell.
- Being pros/being in your job:
  - Showing up every day.
  - Showing up no matter what.
  - Staying on the job all day.
  - Being committed over the long haul.
  - The stakes for us are high and real.
