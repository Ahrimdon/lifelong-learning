# Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook

## INTRODUCTION:

- Fast-paced, competitive, and aggressive, boxing is a natural metaphor for doing business. I hear it in boardrooms all the time. When managers and marketers outline their social media strategies, they often talk about the “knockout punch” or “right hook”—their next highly anticipated sale or campaign—that’s going to put the competition out for the count.
- I’ve been on a mission to convince marketers that today, business is all about making the customer happy.
- After spending so much time preaching the importance of the jab—the one conversation, one engagement at a time that slowly but authentically builds relationships between brands and customers—the last thing I wanted to do was write a book that outlines how to execute a killer right hook with content.
- And I was thinking back to Wine Library TV, the online wine video blog that launched my career in social media marketing and helped pave the way to where I am now.
  - I've always credited the success of that venture to my hustle and single-minded dedication to engaging with my fans and customers by answering every email or blog comment I received and going overboard to show my appreciation for their business.
  - The content. When I launched Wine Library TV, I chose to do long-form video blogs, about twenty minutes apiece, on a platform  where asking people to stick around for five minutes was like asking them to sit through the desert scene in the uncut version of Lawrence of Arabia.
  - And yet they had stuck around, relaxing with their feet up in front of their computers, to watch me taste wine and hear my opinions. Why? Maybe Wine Library TV didn’t catch fire just because I hustled more than everybody else. My high-quality content definitely factored in, but that might not have mattered had I not also made native content—authentic content perfectly crafted for that particular new platform, not thanks to good lighting or smart editing, but because it embraced authenticity and “realness.” And maybe I needed to make sure that my clients and others who turned to me for advice were doing the same.
  - No matter who you are or what kind of company or organization you work for, your number-one job is to tell your story to the consumer wherever they are, and preferably at the moment they are deciding to make a purchase.
  - But the secret sauce remains the same: The incredible brand awareness and bottom-line profits achievable through social media marketing require hustle, heart, sincerity, constant engagement, long-term commitment, and most of all, artful and strategic storytelling. Don’t ever forget it, no matter what you learn here.

## ROUND 1:

- Over the last half decade, marketers have learned to divide their campaigns into three categories—traditional, digital, and social. Social media is cannibalizing digital media, too.
- The evidence is clear. Emails, banner ads, search engine optimization (SEO)—the power of all these stalwart digital marketing tactics of the Internet era is diminishing, with one exception: when the digital platform has a social media component.
- It's natural that every new marketing platform would usurp the one that came before. Radio over print, TV over radio, Internet from everything.
- ***Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a small business, or a Fortune 500 company, great marketing is all about telling your story in such a way that it compels people to buy what you are selling.***
- Traditional marketing: filled with right hooks, and there was no other place for customers to consume their media.
- Social media gives the customers back the advantage, because they can leave.
- New marketing: there is no individual six-month campaign, there's only the 365-day campaign, where you produce new content daily.
- Now, if you know what you’re doing, you scour the Internet daily, searching for references to your product or service so you can jump in on the conversation, or scrambling at a moment’s notice to respond to a 2:47 P.M. complaint via Twitter.
- Because you can't recognize if something really worked immediately, a lot of social media marketing people are still questioning the value of their platforms, and few respect them enough to fully invest, either financially or philosophically.
- Smart ents see things like bikini shots in Snapchat and think, how can they do better?
- You cannot win big in social media if you’re going to be afraid of emerging technology.
- If, whenever they approached a platform, more marketers prepared their stories with the same intensity as boxers, they'd create much better content. Like great boxers, great storytellers are observant and self-aware.
- The real-time feedback that social media makes possible allows brands and businesses to test and retest, with scientific precision, what content connects with their audience, and what leaves them cold.
- Ignoring the deep analytics available for your fan page through Facebook (and through other platforms soon) is the equivalent of stepping into the ring without even having watched a video of your opponent during a fight.

### WHAT MAKES A GREAT STORY?

- A great marketing story is one that sells stuff. It creates an emotion that makes consumers want to do what you ask them to do. Your story isn't powerful enough if all it does is lead the horse to water; it has to inspire the horse to drink, too. On social media, the only story that can achieve that goal is one told with native content.
- Native content amps up your story’s power. Email marketing was a form of native content. It worked well during the 1990s because people were already on email; if you told your story natively and provided consumers with something they valued on that platform, you got their attention. And if you jabbed enough to put them in a purchasing mind-set, you converted. The rules are the same now that people spend their time on social media.
- It can’t tell you what story to tell, but it can inform you how your consumer wants to hear it, when he wants to hear it, and what will most make him want to buy from you. For example, supermarkets or fast-casual restaurants know from radio data that one of the ideal times to run an ad on the radio is around 5:00 P.M., when moms are picking up the kids and deciding what to make for dinner, and even whether they have the energy to cook.
- Social gives you the same kind of insight. Maybe the data tells you that you should post on Facebook early in the morning before people settle into the workplace, and then again at noon when they’re taking a lunch break. The better you learn the psychology and habits of your social media consumers, the better you can tell the right story at the right time.
- At one point it might be “Our barbecue sauce will win you first prize at the chili cook-off,” but later you might decide it’s more important to tell the story that “our barbecue sauce has all-natural, locally sourced ingredients.” How did MasterCard know the time was right for the “Priceless” campaign? Nike had tried a number of stories before it hit on “Just Do It.” There are a number of tropes that often work, but ultimately the story that you decide needs telling can change from day to day, even from hour to hour. The perfect story is spun from your intimate knowledge of your history, your competition’s history, and increasingly, what you see going on in the world and what you discover your consumers want to talk about.
- Native storytelling doesn’t require you to alter your identity to suit a given platform; your identity remains the same no matter what. Different platforms allow you to highlight different aspects of your brand identity, and each jab you make can tell a different part of your story.
- One of the biggest mistakes big brands make is to insist that their tone remain exactly the same no matter what platform they’re using. In clinging to this outdated model, they’re missing out on one of the greatest benefits of social media—always having more than one option.
- Entrepreneurs will have an easier time taking advantage of these options because they aren’t bogged down by the same red tape as Fortune 500 companies. While entrepreneurs and start-ups can respond with ease to real-time consumer feedback, corporate companies usually take a long time to steer their big old ships around.

### THE SWEET SCIENCE

- Social media storytelling is as sweet a science as boxing, requiring constant experimentation and hours of observation.
- Successful online content marketers pay especially close attention to variables such as environmental fluctuations and demographic shifts.
- At what times do we see the highest level of response? What happens when we use slang? How does the same image work with different taglines? Did it make a difference to add a hashtag? Is there an increase in engagement when we put out animated GIFs?
- The answers are out there if you learn how to test properly and correctly interpret the data.
- You can see right away how many people heart on Instagram; how many fans share and comment on Facebook; who repins on Pinterest and how often; how many people reblog and write notes on Tumblr.
- Similarly, each platform is unique, and requires a unique formula. What works on Facebook won’t necessarily work on Twitter.
- Today’s perfect right hooks always include three characteristics:
  - **They make the call to action simple and easy to understand.**
  - **They are perfectly crafted for mobile, as well as all digital devices.**
  - **They respect the nuances of the social network for which you are making the content.**

## ROUND 2: The CHARACTERISTICS of GREAT CONTENT and COMPELLING STORIES

### 1. IT’S NATIVE

- Content is king, but context is God. You can put out good content, but if it ignores the context of the platform on which it appears, it can still fall flat.
- **Most marketers are oblivious to context because marketers are on social media to sell stuff.**
- Consumers, however, are not. They are there for value.
- What is native to a platform? Depends on the platform. Tumblr attracts the artsy crowd and supports animated GIFs (short, rolling loops of video). So would a low-quality photograph on glossy, picture-perfect Pinterest. Twitter speaks to an ironic, urban audience that loves hashtags. An earnest post like “We love our customers!” would probably be soundly ignored. It sounds funny here, and yet posts like these are everywhere, proving that most brands are ignorant about what is native to a platform.
- You already know that successful social media marketing requires throwing many jabs before converting the sale with a right hook.
- Counter-intuitively, the most effective jabs are actually the gentlest. They are thrown with “native” content, which seamlessly blends in with the platform’s offerings and tells stories that engage the consumer at an emotional level. From the outside, jabbing with this kind of content won’t look or feel like the setup for that selling right hook, but it is, because the long-term financial worth of a person’s smile, giggle, snort, and even her tears is invaluable.
- Infomercials and advertorials are usually ridiculed because of their poor production value, but is' more because they have right hooks all over them. They’re informative and entertaining, like a jab, but they’re there to sell. Whether the brand places its ad on a TV screen or in a magazine, it makes sure to plaster a huge phone number and URL across the bottom. And even if those obvious signs weren’t there, the whole tone of the piece is that of a sales pitch.
- Native content, however, is not cheesy when it’s done right, nor is it obvious. What it is, really, is cool. It's whatever hits your emotional center so hard you have to share it with someone else. It can be a quote, a picture, an idea, an article, a comic strip, a song, a spoof, but whatever it is, it says as much about you, the person sharing it, as it does about the brand or business that originated it. There is no formula for cool content, other than that you can’t make it if you don’t have a deep understanding of what makes your audience tick and what they’re seeking when they use social media.
- Creating skillful native content has little to do with selling and a lot to do with skillful storytelling. In the right social-media-savvy hands, a brand that masters native content becomes human.

### 2. IT DOESN’T INTERRUPT

- The Keebler Elves, the Trix bunny, the Yoplait ladies one-upping each other with ecstatic proclamations of how good the yogurt is—they were all created to entertain, so that the next time you were in the mood for cereal or a snack, you’d remember the funny ad and be compelled to try the product.
- Ads and marketing are supposed to make consumers feel something and then act on that feeling. In that regard, the content marketers create today is similar to what it would have been fifty years ago.
- Where it should differ, however, is in the way it affects, or rather, doesn’t affect, your consumer’s media experience.
- Despite being the strong, silent type, the Marlboro Man was still an intruder. People would be watching Bonanza and then there he’d be, interrupting their program to sell them cigarettes.
- No matter how good the ads were, there was a distinct break between the show people were watching and the ad. But today marketers don’t have to intrude on the consumer’s entertainment. In fact, it’s imperative that we don’t. People have no patience for it anymore, as evidenced by the speed with which they jumped on the chance to bypass advertising altogether with the advent of DVRs in the late 1990s, and other commercial-skipping devices.
- **If we want to talk to people while they consume their entertainment, we have to actually be their entertainment, melding seamlessly into the entertainment experience.** Or the news experience. Or the friends-and-family experience. Or the design experience. Or the networking experience. Whatever experience people are seeking on their preferred platforms, that’s what marketers should attempt to replicate. They may not be in a buying frame of mind today, but you never know about tomorrow, and they will be far more likely to make a purchase from a brand they believe understands them and represents what they value than one to which they have no emotional connection.

### 3. IT DOESN’T MAKE DEMANDS—OFTEN

- Make it for your customer or your audience, not for yourself.
- Be generous. Be informative. Be funny. Be inspiring. Be all the characteristics we enjoy in other human beings. That’s what jabs are all about.
- Right hooks represent what is valuable to you—getting the sale, getting people in the door. Jabs are about what is valuable to the consumer. How do you know what content people find valuable? Look on their phones. Phone home screens show you everything you need to know about what kind of content people value. In general, the three most popular app categories are:
  - **Social networks, which tells you that people are interested in other people.**
  - **Entertainment, including games and music apps, which tells you that people want to escape.**
  - **Utility, including maps, notepads, organizers, and weight loss management systems, which tells you that people value service.**
  - Much of your content should fall within one of these three categories. A cosmetics company could easily tell a story about utility by giving their customers short videos (under fifteen seconds) on Facebook on how to properly apply their makeup, or put out an infographic on Pinterest illustrating the interesting facts about their product history and how women have used it over time.
  - But how would a cosmetics company provide entertainment? If it’s selling to eighteen- to twenty-five-year-old females, it could post demos of new music that appeals to eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds, and deconstruct female music stars’ stage makeup, maybe admiring the risks they take and explaining how people could try to get the same toned-down effect at home.
  - As for how the company can tap into its customers’ desire to interact with people, it just needs to be human. It needs to get in on conversations, find shared interests with consumers, and respond and react to what people are saying, not just about the brand per se, but about related topics, like how women can erase the signs of fatigue and stress before a big presentation even when they’ve been up since three in the morning with a baby, or what age is appropriate for girls to start shaping their eyebrows.
  - It could also talk about unrelated topics. Just because its main product was makeup wouldn’t mean that it couldn’t also talk about gaming or food, because it’s possible that fans could be enthusiastic about those topics, too. Jabs can be anything that helps set up your “commercial ask.”
- When you deliver a precise jab with native content, it might take your consumer a split second before he realizes that the story he’s paying attention to is being told by a brand, not an individual. Yet if your content is great, the realization won’t piss him off. Instead, he’ll appreciate what you’re offering. Because when you jab, you’re not selling anything.
- You’re not asking your consumer for a commitment. You’re just sharing a moment together. Something, anything, except a sales pitch. Skillful, native storytelling increases the likelihood that a person will share your content with a friend, thus increasing the likelihood of that friend remembering your brand the next time she decides she needs whatever it is you sell.
- The emotional connection you build through jabbing pays off on the day you decide to throw the right hook.
- **No way is a consumer going to say yes if you ambush him with a giant pop-up that blacks out the middle of the Web page he’s reading.**

### 4. IT LEVERAGES POP CULTURE

- If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. The young generation isn’t the only one consuming their culture via phone, either. Everyone is, including the ones who used to listen to their music on records, cassettes, and CDs. So use that to your advantage. Show your fans, whoever they are, that you love the same music they do.
- Prove that you understand them by staying on top of the gossip about celebrities from their generation. Create content that reveals your understanding of the issues and news that matter to them. Just don’t place it in a mobile banner ad.
- **The days of stopping people from what they’re doing to look at your ad are at best diminishing, and more than likely over, and regardless are overpriced for the ROI.**

### 5. IT’S MICRO

- There is something else you could do as you reevaluate your social media creative: stop thinking about your content as content. Think about it, rather, as micro-content—tiny, unique nuggets of information, humor, commentary, or inspiration that you reimagine every day, even every hour, as you respond to today’s culture, conversations, and current events in real time in a platform’s native language and format.
- Did the micro-content offer consumers anything of value, as a proper jab should? It’s unlikely it would have received any attention if it hadn't. Don’t underestimate the value of a fun surprise, a grin, and a sudden craving for chocolate and shortening.
- For a few days, the whole world, in traditional media and social, had positive things to say about Oreo. At the very least, everyone who saw it got the chance to say they witnessed the beginning of a new era in marketing.
- The next time a brand responds in real time, will the Twittersphere go crazy? Probably not, which is why it’s good to be first to market, even on platforms that don’t appear to have tremendous value at first glance. Your job as a marketer is not just about selling more product (though that’s a priority, and don’t forget it), but increasingly about making sure that you are first to market as often as possible in terms of timing, the quality of your micro-content, and the originality with which you respond to the world around you.
- `Micro-Content + Community Management = Effective Social Media Marketing`
  - Businesses can forge a direct connection between their community and their brand when they stop thinking about social media as the backup to the main events. It should be a main event in and of itself, serving as the nexus connecting every other channel by which businesses talk to their customers.
- There’s no reason for marketers to draft new overarching social media campaigns every year. Everyone’s should be as simple as this:
  - Jab at people, all the time, every day.
  - Talk about what they’re talking about.
  - When they start talking about something different, talk about that instead.
  - Not every brand has to jab at the same rate as its competitor. Remember, quality and quantity—some brands can get away with just a few jabs here and there; others need to jab all the time.
  - Successful storytelling builds brand equity, and businesses with high brand equity don’t need to draw as much attention to themselves and their achievements as those that are still establishing their value to the consumer.

### 6. IT’S CONSISTENT AND SELF-AWARE

- Though your business’s micro-content will vary wildly every day, it must consistently answer the question “Who are we?” You can and should learn to speak as many languages as possible, but no matter which language you’re using, your core story must remain constant.
- When you know your message, it’s easy to keep it consistent in every setting. No marketer should find this a daunting concept—we do it every day when we navigate the analog world. You’re going to wear a different outfit and use different vocabulary when you’re sitting down for tea with your grandmother in her home than when you’re living it up with friends in a nightclub. Creating micro-content is simply a way for your brand to adapt according to the circumstances and the whims of your audience.
- When you create stellar content native to a platform’s context, you can make a person feel; if your content can make a person feel, he is likely to share it with others, providing you with amplified word of mouth at a fraction of the cost of most other media. You could spend a million dollars to acquire committed fans on Facebook, and that would be money well spent, but if you also storytell properly, the only additional cost you’ll have is for the nonworking creative.
- Your content simply lives on, replicating itself over and over as your fans and followers pass it along through word of mouth, diminishing your costs with every retweet, share, pin, heart, and post.
- The concept of owning content and relationships instead of renting them has gained enormous traction with the start-up entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, but it has been slower to infiltrate the mind-set of most Fortune 500 companies and traditional small businesses around the world. That’s going to change once they realize that they are no longer beholden to media companies to disseminate their content and connect with their consumers. Thanks to social media, they’ll be able to do it all by themselves. Some already are, as we’ll see in the upcoming chapters.

## ROUND 3:

### STORYTELL on FACEBOOK

- Let me say that again: ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE PAGE VIEWS IN THE UNITED STATES IS ON FACEBOOK!
- Think about why people go to Facebook: to connect, socialize, and catch up on what the people they know and presumably care about are doing.
- In the process, they also find out what their friends and acquaintances are reading, listening to, wearing, and eating; what causes they are championing; what ideas they’re hatching; what jobs they’re hunting; and where they are going.
- **Facebook wants users to see things that they find relevant, fun, and useful, not annoying and pointless, or else they’ll abandon the site. Which means you’d better create content that’s relevant, fun, and useful, too.**
- The very thing that makes marketers want to have a presence on Facebook—the sheer number of users—makes the platform a marketing challenge. A billion users, and all the content they generate, creates a conundrum: with so many pieces of content streaming into consumers’ News Feeds and competing for attention, it’s unlikely they will see any content you post, even the good stuff.
- Facebook knows this. Long ago, when college students were the biggest population on Facebook and the user pool was relatively small, people’s News Feeds were organized chronologically. But as the user base grew—and grew and grew—Facebook had to figure out how to prevent users’ streams from getting clogged up with posts they weren’t interested in.

- To help mitigate the consequences of literal TMI, Facebook finally settled on an algorithm called EdgeRank. Every interaction a person has with Facebook, from posting a status update or a photo, to liking, sharing, or commenting, is called an “edge,” and theoretically, every edge channels into the news stream. But not everyone who could see these edges actually does, because EdgeRank is constantly reading algorithmic tea leaves to determine which edges are most interesting to the most number of people. It tracks all the engagement a user’s own content receives, as well as the engagement a user has with other people’s or brands’ content.
- The more engagement a user has with a piece of content, the stronger EdgeRank believes that user’s interest will be in similar content, and it filters that person’s news stream accordingly (a randomizer ensures that occasionally we’ll see a post from someone we haven’t talked to in years, thus keeping Facebook fresh and surprising).
- **For example, EdgeRank makes sure that a user who often likes or comments on a friend’s photos, but who ignores that friend’s plain-text status updates, will see more of that friend’s photos and fewer of his status updates.**

- Here’s why: Through EdgeRank, Facebook weighs likes, comments, and shares, but it currently does not give greater weight to click-throughs or any other action that leads to sales.
- Facebook’s greatest priority is making the platform valuable to the consumer, not to you, the marketer.
- What it cares about is whether people are interested in the content they see on Facebook, because if they’re interested, they’ll come back.
- What proves interest? Likes, comments, shares, and clicks—not purchases.
- You could put out a piece of content with a hyperlink to your product page that garners $2 million in sales in thirty minutes.
- On Facebook, the definition of great content is not the content that makes the most sales, but the content that people most want to share with others.
- Unfortunately, while it tries hard to guess what is important to users, Facebook still can’t determine their intent. Which action, or edge, indicates more interest—commenting on a post or liking a post? If a person actually clicks on a picture, is she showing more interest than if she shares it? Is a picture more valuable than a video? Does liking a video post show equal interest as watching the entire video? Facebook doesn’t know, but it desperately wants to, so it keeps tweaking the algorithm to figure the mystery out.

### JABS IN ACTION

- As the CMO of the boot company stands there looking, at best, curious and, at worst, furious, you will calmly point to the analytics (called Page Insights), which will reveal that that particular post is getting higher than usual engagement over more traditional boot-centered posts, just as you thought it would. Why? Because through previous jabs asking things like “What’s your favorite TV show?” you had already gathered the consumer insight that 80 percent of your fans were crazy about 30 Rock. And you knew that the series finale was approaching. So by putting out a “Good-bye, 30 Rock” piece, you are connecting with your community and showing them that not only do you get them, but you are one of them.
- All of a sudden your brand is talking like a human being, not a boot company. And as the overindexing (meaning a post performs above normal for that brand) reveals, people like that. They respond.
- This is good for you, because the uptick in engagement tells Facebook that this brand matters to people. Nor is the next one, a Valentine’s Day card that doesn’t show a single boot. Then you put out another three or four pieces of content that don’t sell anything, either, like this:
- Third jab: Post—A fifteen-second video about rock climbing.
- Fourth jab: Poll—“Would you rather wear your boots in the summer or the winter?”
- The point is to give and give and give, for no other reason than to entertain your customers and make them feel like you get them.
- And the more you give, the more you really will get them.
- Before, every piece of content had to be a right hook because all we knew about customers who bought boots was that they needed protective footwear.
- By testing and jabbing and giving, we learn what they find entertaining. Content that entertains sees engagement. Content that sees engagement tells Facebook and the rest of the world that your customers care about your brand, so that when you finally do put out something that would directly benefit your bottom line—a coupon, a free-shipping offer, or some other call to action—4 percent of your community sees it instead of a half percent, which gives you a much better chance at making a sale.

### TARGET YOUR JABS AND RIGHT HOOKS

- On any other platform, where your posts are entirely public, every jab hits everyone in the face. On Facebook, however, you can be extremely selective, customizing your jabs and targeting subsets of your fan base.
- Now, you could post the piece to your fifty-five-year-old male customers if you change the content so that it resonates with them.

### SMART SPENDING

- It’s worth taking a step back and examining the cost-effectiveness of this scenario. With very little lead time, a retailer can create two distinct pieces of content, send it directly to two separate demographics, and watch in real time to see how the recipients respond. If the excited comments start to pile up, or the content starts getting shared, that retailer knows the right hook made its mark.
- Now, there’s nothing wrong with spending money when you’re spending it smartly. All along you’ve probably been buying the Facebook ads that line up along the right side of the site. On average, the cost of running an ad on the right side of the page on Facebook runs the gamut between $.50 to $1.50 per like, though depending on the specificity of your targeting, the length of your campaign, and your budget it’s possible to acquire likes for as low as $.10 and as high as several dollars. That’s a steal, even when you compare it to the cost of email acquisition, which can run as low as $0.49. How can a dollar spent acquiring a Facebook fan be worth more than forty-nine cents anywhere else? Because a social user on your fan page has more potential reach than anywhere else.

### SPONSORED STORIES

- Sponsored stories were launched in early 2011, but it was in the fall of 2012 that they came into their own, mostly because Facebook announced that it was finally making an algorithmic adjustment that would purposely limit how many people would organically see a brand’s posts, even if they had already become fans by liking the brand’s page.
- Until recently, though the algorithm was calibrated to limit spam or uninteresting content, good content could still organically reach a large percentage of fans.
- **As of September 2013, however, Facebook’s algorithm will only allow your content to reach about 3–5 percent of your fans. To reach more, you have to post some extremely engaging content. Or, you have to pay. In this way, Facebook is able to protect the consumer’s experience by raising the barrier to entry to the News Feed.**
- I didn't understand people’s fury. Marketers and business owners who would never get mad about paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a network to get their ad on TV, even when they’d never know whether the ad had gotten anyone’s attention, were having coronaries over having to pay for the same kind of distribution.
  - Create great content that gets people to engage and Facebook will let you show that content to more and more people. Create content no one cares about and Facebook will make it as difficult as possible for you put more of it out on its site.
  - Sponsored stories is a superior ad platform because it rewards nimbleness and quick reaction. When it shows us that a piece of content is resonating, we know to spend money on it. It’s so clear. Let’s say that on average about 20 percent of the people who received my emails back then actually opened them, and one day I sent out an email that saw a 21 percent open rate. Then I saw that the wine mentioned in that email was suddenly selling extremely well. Clearly something about that email had made it extra valuable to my audience. How much would that knowledge have been worth?
  - I would have happily paid Yahoo, Gmail, and Hotmail a premium to make sure that the next time I sent out that email, as many people as possible saw it, whether it was by working around spam filters or finding a way for the emails to automatically open when people went to their email accounts. A service like that would have been the greatest marketing tool in the world—heck, are you listening, Google?—and it’s close to what you can achieve through Facebook sponsored stories.

- Facebook is shockingly bad at explaining sponsored stories, so let me try here. There are two types. One simply extends your chosen piece of content to the news streams of a larger number of your fans than the regular 3–5 percent that would normally see it. That’s called a Page Post. The other extends your reach the same way, but it allows you to highlight the fact that a fan has engaged with your content and tell that fan’s friends about it.
- You can choose to create this kind of sponsored story around a check-in, a like, and several other actions such as when someone shares a story from your app or your website.
- **For example, if a fan checked in to a hotel, or claimed an offer from a T-shirt company, the hotel or T-shirt company could pay to make sure that friends of that fan knew about it, not with an ad lingering on the periphery of the Facebook page that no one but PC users will see, but within the actual newsfeed.**
- Before, when we created ads around a post, as soon as it migrated to the right side of the page the format of the post would change. This transformation compromised the impact of the creative work because it no longer looked like an organic piece of content created by someone you knew, but like an ad created by some stranger.
- But now marketers can keep the creative that we already know works organically, and enhance its power simply by paying to have more people see it, offering us an unparalleled opportunity to connect with active fans as well as reinvigorate relationships with fans that might have gone dormant over time.

- **Sponsored stories work like this: When I sponsor the story, a higher number of people than normally follow my page will see it in their News Feed.** Now they are reminded about me. If the content is actually good enough to compel them to act on that piece of content—liking, sharing, or commenting on it—they get brought back into my orbit, and Facebook believes I am relevant once again: “Facebook users like GaryVee, so I’m going to give them more GaryVee.” Now the next time I post a new piece of content, many more of those people will be likely to see it. Yet I won’t have had to pay any additional money to get those impressions.
- And if the engagement continues, my initial costs will continue to diminish as my impressions rise. It could trigger a snowball effect that could last well into the next month, and all for the price of one small sponsored story.
- What you get is extended reach and an additional layer of targeting above and beyond that of an ordinary post or targeted post, both of which are free. Put money behind a well-performing targeted post and turn it into a sponsored story, and you’ll increase the specificity with which you can target your audience.

### GREAT BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

- Facebook calculates the initial value of your sponsored story based on the competition you face for your targeted audience, and how much that competition is willing to pay. If you create a great ad that compels people to engage with you, Facebook will decide that your ad deserves priority over a competitor’s ad that isn’t as engaging. **In addition, when Facebook sees that people are interacting with your content, it will show that content to more people, because it is obviously enhancing the quality and entertainment value of the News Feed.**
- The second people stop clicking, though, Facebook will stop running the ad as a sponsored story. Unless, of course, you insist on throwing more money behind it. But why would you? Essentially, Facebook purposely makes it cost-inefficient to distribute bad creative.
- Facebook will, not because it’s nice enough to protect you from yourself, but because it’s savvy enough to protect itself from you. It’s in Facebook’s best interest for you to put out great content. It wants to monetize, but if users start feeling like they’re being spammed every time they go to the site, Facebook will suffer.
- If networks could show marketers data that proved that every time they showed the consumer a bad commercial, consumers turned off their TV, TV commercials would be better. That’s what Facebook, and all social media, can do for us. Ideally, when Facebook informs you that no one is interacting with your sponsored story, that’s your cue to stop and rework the piece, or chuck it altogether. Social media gives us real-time feedback from the consumer, which forces us to be better marketers, strategists, and service providers.
- Ultimately, the changes implemented to Facebook ads only changed how much it costs you to work with Facebook, not how you tell your story. If you’re a brand that understands how to jab in ways that bring value to your customers—giving them a moment of levity with a cartoon, or a game to play, or any other escapist content, which then primes them to be open to giving you business when you finally ask with a right hook—you’ll win.
- It’s possible that the platform will decide to start using actual purchases as indicators of fan interest more than the engagement of comments, likes, or shares. That could mean that Facebook becomes as much of a right hook platform as it is a jab platform. The last thing Facebook wants to become is a right hook platform, because it will die.
- My advice to marketers is to quit complaining and start creating micro-content worth the money it will take you to successfully reach the customers Facebook is now guarding so carefully. Figure out how to work the system and get the most bang for your buck.

### AIR CANADA: Ruining a Good Idea

- When Air Canada’s very first flight attendant, who worked for the airline from 1938 to 1943, died at the age of 102, Air Canada paid her tribute by posting her photograph and a link to an interview their in-flight magazine conducted with her about six months before her death. It should have been a successful jab that engaged a large number of their 400,000 fans. Unfortunately, they blew it.
  - It's not visually compelling.
  - It's burdened with too much text.
  - It's a link post when it should have been a picture post.
  - Yet the two big blocks of text surrounding it water down the impact of the photo. By uploading the photograph as a picture post instead of a link post, however, and overlaying the lines announcing Mrs. Garner Grant’s death onto the picture itself, Air Canada could have emphasized the photo and simultaneously explained why it was relevant.

### JEEP: Evoking the Right Emotions

- This picture perfectly encapsulates the Jeep brand. Jeep could not have chosen a better model than the pretty young woman in this photo, with her shades, her flying hair, and her huge smile evoking summer, fun, and freedom. What’s cool is that she’s not a model—she’s someone a fan named Megan Bryant photographed and posted on Facebook. The movement and mood of this picture are striking enough to be worth checking out more closely. One look, and you start to wish you had a Jeep, too.
- The only thing that could slightly improve this piece would have been to make sure that the copy, “It’s a Jeep Thing,” was more visible, perhaps by placing it onto the photo itself. With that small adjustment, Jeep would have delivered a powerful image, its logo, and its terrific tagline all in one shot. Otherwise, kudos to Jeep for such a beautiful, humanizing, and well-executed jab.

### MERCEDES-BENZ: A Great Product Deserved Better

- All they had to do was include one line of text about the car’s sumptuous interior, and then link out to the excellent Forbes article that told readers everything else they needed to know.
- Poorly placed call to action: In addition, they placed their call to action—the link to the article—at the bottom of that big paragraph of text. Why would they?
- No logo: As gorgeous as the car is, there’s no way to know who made it unless you think to look at the post’s profile picture. It wouldn’t have sacrificed any class or sophistication to make sure the Mercedes-Benz logo was tastefully inserted somewhere on the photo itself.

### SUBARU: Amateur Night

- There is so much to dislike about this piece of content it’s hard to know where to start.
- Whereas Mercedes-Benz talked too much, Subaru has said too little. The copy length is ideal, but there was no reason to skip the opportunity to hint that the review was a positive one. They’ve missed a chance to get the fans excited and make them want to read more.
- Terrible photo: Unless Subaru intended to sell pavement along with its cars, there is no reason why a wet road should dominate the entire lower half of the photograph.
- No logo: There’s no reason for anyone to take notice of this photograph, but even if it did somehow register, without a logo there is nothing to explain to people why this car deserves attention.
- While nothing could turn this pig’s ear into a silk purse, simply adding the Consumer Reports headline, a logo, and cropping the photo differently might turn this wasted opportunity into a serviceable jab.

### VICTORIA’S SECRET: Fluent in the Platform’s Language

- With this powerful right hook, Victoria’s Secret shows that they are fluent in native content–ese:
- Dramatic photo: Obviously it’s not just the wings this model is sporting that are going to get people—men who love what she’s showing, and women who wish they had what she’s showing—to screech to a halt in midscroll. But Victoria’s Secret made sure that the design of the photo was as captivating as its subject. The image is big and bold enough to swallow up both a PC screen and a mobile screen; the minimalist black-and-white adds drama; the hot pink script overlaid against the model’s wings is as eye-popping as her cleavage and the lingerie enhancing it.
- Good use of copy: The text in the photo was placed close to the center, so that even if the picture were cropped because of a small mobile screen, the text would remain visible. The copy is short and direct, but that line in parentheses delivers it with a little wink, which adds the dollop of personality and humor that is so necessary to any brand’s social efforts.
- Appropriate links: **After the words “Apply here,” Victoria’s Secret attaches a link that takes you directly to the page where you can register for an Angel Card, making it easy and fast to make the sale.** Is such a self-evident move really worth praise? You’d be amazed at how many brands set up a beautiful right hook, and then link to their general website, leaving customers fumbling around as they hunt for the appropriate tab so they can make their purchase.

### MINI COOPER: Inspiring a Spirit of Adventure

- Great voice: I love the voice in this piece. **In two lines, the status update promises that if you stick with Mini, you’ll find adventure.** The idea of driving with the top down through snow is so absurd, it’s almost impossible to resist clicking on the attached link to find out how Mini could act like this drive was the trip of a lifetime. And the line “Wrap up warm” adds to our curiosity by hinting that whatever lies behind that link will put to rest any doubts we might have as to how comfortable the experience could be.
- Lacks a logo: I’ll forgive Mini for neglecting to include a logo on the photograph it used for this Facebook piece because the Mini is an iconic car, recognizable even when photographed from the back, as in this image.

### ZARA: Bait and Switch

- Why it chose to fail those fans so badly with this useless post is incomprehensible. Let’s dissect why it is a complete waste of the brand’s and its fans’ time.
- Poor mobile optimization.
- Good copy: At least they got the copy right. "Just Apps" is short and sweet and tells you everything you need to know, which is that Zara has apps. Great. Where do I get me some? Ah, a link! I’m going to click on it. Now I can shop on the Zara official home page. But I wanted to download an app! Isn't that what you just announced, your apps? What the hell, Zara?
- The more a brand posts links to sites that don’t bring value to their customers, the more hesitant fans are going to be to click any links they see from that brand in the future. This Facebook post is a short-term fail for letting its fans down with a bait-and-switch post, and a potentially long-term fail for jeopardizing the respect and equity Zara has earned within its community.

### REGAL CINEMAS: Leveraging Their Brand

- No industry has a better stable of iconic images with which to leverage their brand than the film industry. Regal Cinemas, however, bucked the trend with this successful jab that pits two movie characters against each other.
- The picture: The theater’s marketing creatives probably sifted through thousands of pictures of each of these movie characters before deciding which ones to use, and they chose well. Even though Thornton Melon and Frank the Tank went back to school in films made almost twenty years apart, they’re clearly steeped in the same frat DNA.
- The copy: For once, the status update for this content doesn’t repeat the copy in the artwork. Instead, the headline of the picture sets up the question, and the status update reminds us of the characters’ names, just in case someone out there isn’t familiar with them.
- And yet, at the risk of repeating itself, the company could have seen even better engagement had they listed the names of each character under their photo, or at worst simply labeled them “A” or “B.” **Rule of thumb: Make it as easy as possible for your fans to engage! Why take the risk that someone won’t be able to come up with the characters’ names right away and therefore lose the opportunity to engage with them?**
- Yet again, no logo: Good for Regal Cinemas for remembering to build brand equity, but they would have been better off using a logo than a banner across the bottom of the art.** Few people are going to type out the movie theater’s URL, so a better use of their limited space would have been to include a sizable logo in the corner.** But that’s a minor criticism.

### PHILIPPINE AIRLINES: Totally Unappetizing

- People love to talk about food, so Philippine Airlines, which flies to lots of exotic destinations, had a good idea when it decided to ask its fans to describe their most exotic meal. But after having such a good idea, why did the company waste it?
- Poor use of the platform: It should go without saying that if you’re going to talk about food, and you have the option to post a photograph, you should post the damn photograph. It would have taken little effort to turn this content into something beautiful or fun.
- Toneless: With airplane food the butt of so many jokes, they couldn’t come up with a way to imply that Philippine Airlines knows a little bit about great food? The company simply made no attempt to make the question relevant to Philippine Airlines or its customers.
- Too many call-to-actions: **Finally, Philippine Airlines needs to remember that less is more. Doubling the number of calls to action made it more challenging to get people to answer the questions.** It seems crazy, but when people are moving through the stream as fast as they do now, two questions are too much. They should have been listed as two separate posts.

### SELENA GOMEZ: A Golden Touch

- Your phone and your fingers are together all the time, so why shouldn’t they complement each other? No wonder the hot new women’s fashion trend is to match your manicure to your phone case.
- The photo: It’s big and bold, very native to the Facebook platform. **With Selena’s glittery hand and phone swallowing up the camera, the picture would have been unmissable as fans scrolled through their news streams.**
- The copy: Celebrities are some of the worst social media abusers, and one of their biggest offenses is that they usually talk too much. Selena doesn't, and with this status update she was smart enough to keep her text short and playful.
- Shared more than 6,000 times and earning more than 220,000 likes, this sponsored story with Selena Gomez shows how far fans are willing to carry a brand’s content when you make them feel like everything you do is just for them.

### SHAKIRA: Falling Flat

- Wrong type of post: Remember how Selena’s photo exploded into your line of vision?
- This one you have to squint to see, because it’s a link post, not a photo post. When you attach YouTube links, the fill-out—the headline, link, and text—share as much space as the photo, minimizing the photo’s effectiveness.
- Poor photo: **The point of the post is to promote Shakira’s new perfume. So why are we seeing an image of her posing with a fan and a signed soccer jersey at a podium?** It’s great to show how comfortable and generous Shakira is with her fans, but this is the wrong image for the purpose of this content.
- The copy: First there’s the copy in English. Then there’s the copy in Spanish. And then there’s the description in the YouTube fill-out. This isn’t a novel, it’s a status update, and it’s supposed to be short. **Brands have always been able to post according to language and location, so there was no need to double up on languages in this post.** Especially when the content is so uninspiring.
- No engagement: **In addition, with the exception of one shout-out to her fans to thank them for liking her new Facebook page, there’s no engagement between the star and her fans.** That seems like a strange choice for someone who wants people to buy her perfume.
- The video: It’s six minutes long. No one in a Facebook mobile world has time to watch a six-minute video about your new perfume, no matter how much we like you.
- The whole package, if you can stand to sit through the entire length of it, is supposed to give us a peek into the whirlwind life of a star, while revealing her humanity. There are many ways that Shakira’s team could have accomplished this while bringing value to her fans.

### LIL WAYNE: Welcome to Spam City, USA

- There is no other way to start this review than to congratulate Lil Wayne for becoming the first person to successfully turn Facebook into Myspace.
- Poor page management: Allowing people to use your fan page to build up their own businesses and Facebook pages is an insult to all the core fans who come here to be a part of your community.
- It’s tough for me to make fun of Weezy because I love his music, but honestly, when you put this little effort into your social media promotion, you’re no better than the amateurs sticking promo fliers under people’s windshield wipers.

### MOSCOT: Possibly the Most Confusing Facebook Post Ever

- Text, text, and more problems with text: First, there’s the double copy supporting the photograph of Johnny Depp, in Hebrew and in English (though it takes some effort to find the English text). Facebook is not the place to be flooding fans with text.
- Indecipherable text: Second, the copy that does hit us in the face is in Hebrew. It’s kind of arresting, and when combined with the photo of Johnny Depp may be enough to make readers stop in their tracks. But not for long. As soon as most fans realize that they can’t read anything on the page—this is an American company, and most fans will be American—they’re going to move on.

### UNICEF: Giving Away Too Much, Too Soon

- Good imagery: UNICEF did a lot right here. They had their finger on the pop culture pulse and chose the right celebrity with the ever-popular Katy Perry. The picture of a smiling Katy jumping rope with some village girls in her UNICEF T-shirt is spot-on, and should work well to bring awareness to the brand.
- Botched copy: Where they goofed is in the copy. The first line is “Want to know what Katy Perry has been up to?” Good question. Provocative. Engaging. And UNICEF blew it by offering the answer.
- **The post should have ended with that first line, punctuated with a link.** Leaving the question hanging would have whetted visitors’ appetites for more, and kept them intrigued enough to follow UNICEF’s digital bread crumbs to their website, where they could have elaborated on their humanitarian work in Madagascar and other countries. Serving up the answer right away robbed the post of all its energy and style.

### LAND ROVER: Going Nowhere

- No brand ID: Don’t get me wrong, the execution is weird. Imagine this coming through your stream. You see a woman peering through a telescope at you, but with no logo and no prominently overlaid text, there’s no way to know what it’s about unless you pause to squint at the text below.
- Wrong URL: There, we see the post is from Land Rover, and that they’ve got something special planned and they’d like us to send in a passport-style photo to landroversocialmedia@gmail.com. Why didn’t Land Rover secure a .landrover email address instead of a Gmail address? In addition, one can only hope that they aren’t strict with their definition of “passport-style,” because the photo they used, with half the woman’s head blocked by a telescope, is not passport-style.
- Maybe that doesn’t matter, though, because when we click through the link that takes us to a page where we can read more about the project, they don’t reiterate the passport-style requirement.
- Go-nowhere link: This error in consistency is minor, however, compared with the fact that the link takes us from the company’s Facebook post straight to another company Facebook post. This tells me that the creative team wasn’t given the proper financial or managerial support to execute this project correctly with a proper website.
- Showing off scrappy entrepreneurial spirit and making do with the resources you've got is admirable for a start-up, but not for a company like Land Rover, which sells a fairly expensive product.

### STEVE NASH: A Disappointing Departure

- Nonnative design: Anyone who visited Nash’s fan page directly was invited to the Steve Nash Foundation “HOWDOW.” If they consumed this on their phone they saw it as an “OWDOW.” You’ve got to be smart about your status update art, and someone on Nash’s media team was not.
- Broken link: The URL attached to the update doesn’t link out, which means Nash is counting on fans cutting and pasting the link into their URL if they want to go to the Showdown website. I assure you all of zero people did that, which is too bad because it’s a beautiful website, not to mention an extremely cool and worthy cause.
- No spam control: The comment thread is littered with it. There’s a plague of people who use popular fan pages to promote themselves or their businesses, and the managers of these pages need to do a better job of weeding them out.
- All of these mistakes can only be a result of carelessness or laziness. Nash fans deserve better.

### AMTRAK: Using Sawdust to Its Advantage

- I ride Amtrak all the time, and this Facebook post made me glad that I do. I love this post—it’s one of the best jabs I’ve seen in a long time. Best of all, it allows me to dispel some confusion about what social media can and cannot do.
- Great use of sawdust: You’ve got to be damn smart to figure out how to take an image of something quite boring, even forgettable, like two train seats, and turn it into a fun, energizing piece of content. I call material like those train seats “sawdust”—assets that you have just lying around, maybe something you totally take for granted.
- Gamification: Not only did Amtrak take advantage of their sawdust, they gamified it. Tag who you’d like to travel with—that’s a fun, clever challenge that strikes an emotional punch (although it’s a fairly big ask that could give you unreliable results). And what a great way to take advantage of the platform. Every person who receives a notification that they’ve been tagged will immediately register the Amtrak brand. It’s a great way to build awareness even among people who may not already be fans.
- Authenticity: **There’s a real person behind this post, too. You can tell because when one fan suggested Justin Bieber as his preferred seatmate, Amtrak replied with “But where would Selena Gomez go?”** With one sentence, Amtrak reveals that its employees are our contemporaries, people just like us, with their fingers on the pop culture pulse, a sense of humor, and a real interest in their customers.
- The only criticism worth lobbing at Amtrak is that they chose a picture of some pretty worn-out seats. This brings me to the misconception a lot of marketers have about social media. It’s not lipstick. No matter how brilliant, clever, or authentic you are, nothing will cover up the flaws in your content. Some people will appreciate the retro look of the seats, but a lot of people won’t find them very appealing.

### BLACKBERRY: Missed Details Matter

- My team and I struggled for several minutes to understand the story behind this post. We liked a lot about it, but then we realized that if it was that challenging to figure out what BlackBerry was trying to say, the story couldn’t have registered much with an audience that probably spent less than a second thinking about it.
- Poor storytelling technique: I understand the story that BlackBerry was trying to tell—the BlackBerry Z10 is two phones in one—one for work, one for play. And if you click on the link below the picture, you’re taken to a pretty cool YouTube video that illustrates exactly what’s special about the phone. In addition, you’ll find another link that takes you to the product’s retail site. **But though the brand correctly chose to make its photo the star of the update, the image does not do enough of the storytelling for us.** Why not show someone attending a kid’s soccer game juxtaposed with a shot of that same person at the office? You have to look extremely closely to recognize the difference between the two screens. In addition, the text talks about work-life harmony, but the screens are reversed, in life-work order. That’s sloppy. **And finally, people live their whole lives looking at screens—now they have to look at screens on their screens?** It’s a little meta for a mobile device company.
- BlackBerry was right to make a big push for this product and tell their story in social, but they should have paid more attention to the details of their execution.

### MICROSOFT: Riding the Waves

- Good use of links: In this exciting jab, Microsoft is promoting a product called Fresh Paint, an app that allows you to use a palette of colors to “paint” in templates or even on your own pictures and photographs.
- Offers quality, value, and authenticity: The post shows that the creative team at Microsoft is doing some smart thinking about where the cultural conversation is going, and how they can find ways to be a part of it. The brand receives more high marks for the quality of the image, the fact that the voice of the text isn't too corporate, and the way they brought something of value to their community. In this status update and on the blog, Microsoft really does sound excited about both the movie and their product. If only more companies would use Facebook this well.

### ZEITGEIST: Missing Its Inner Hipster

- This post is stunningly bad. Hipsters have told me that Zeitgeist is the ultimate hipster bar in San Francisco. Ironically, everything that’s wrong with this jab could have been easily avoided if someone with a modicum of stereotypically hipster skills had created the post.
- Low Facebook value: First, the post in and of itself has zero value but to divert fans to Twitter. There’s no copy, just a mess of hashtags. Hashtags have infiltrated our culture so much that people are starting to use them as an ironic coda to status updates and even regular conversations. They have long been a huge part of Twitter and Instagram’s appeal, where they overindex, and recently Facebook introduced them to the platform as well. It’s possible that Zeitgeist was trying to incorporate hashtags into their voice, but they don’t work here.
- Incorrect post format: Next, it’s a link post, and at the time this post was created, link posts underperformed compared with picture posts that link out (though that could change in the future). In this case, though, a picture post wouldn’t have saved the status update. It might have even made it worse.
- Sorry photography: The picture is so dark and blurry you really have to work to see what it is. Zeitgeist is a hip brand whose demo is all about modern technology. Photography has become a kind of social currency. This is not a great photo. It’s not even good. It’s the kind of picture you delete and take again. It’s the kind of subliminal message that can kill a company.

### TARTINE BAKERY: One Hot Mess

- Unclear messaging: This post on the Tartine Bakery fan page is actually promoting an event at the bakery’s sister restaurant, Bar Tartine.
- It’s fine to cross-promote among communities, but they should have made it explicitly clear that this isn’t a bakery event, since most fans are coming to this fan page looking for bakery news.
- Awkward text: They write: “Bar Tartine (with Link!) hosts . . .” What an awkward, poorly written phrase. Plus, it shows that someone at Tartine actually believes that fans are too stupid to know what that little blue URL is for at the end of the post.
- Irrelevant hashtag: What’s up with the hashtag? The post doesn’t direct us to Twitter, so what purpose does it serve here?
- No photo: This is as visually unfriendly as it gets. Tartine is promoting a food-centered charitable event, and they couldn’t whet our appetites with a little teaser of food porn or some other cool image to get us excited about it?
- Insufficient page management: Finally, back on the fan page, the four spam comments—the only comments anyone bothered to make—are the cherries on top of this crap sundae.

### TWIX: Having Fun

- Twix threw a good jab here. They left their logo off the photograph, which is too bad, because as I have repeatedly pointed out, these images go through consumers’ mobile streams so quickly it’s easy for them to see a picture but not register who posted it.
- Clever storytelling, strong voice, good use of pop culture: In the past, Twix has run television ads that played on the crisp sound of a Twix snapping in two, and in this post they’re reinforcing that story by playing off the well-known “tree in the forest” philosophical riddle.
- It’s a cute idea. The text shows that the writer has a strong feel for the brand’s quirky, playful voice. The nice level of engagement the post received proves how appealing it is to customers when a brand skillfully inserts itself into the pop culture conversation to tell its story. They should be primed to respond whenever Twix gets ready to throw a right hook down the line.

### COLGATE: Good Copy Gone Bad

- Catchy text: “Did You Know?” in all caps works for me. Maybe I like the copy in this Colgate post because I grew up an ESPN SportsCenter fan. Regardless, this is an appropriately short, tight, positive reinforcement of the brand’s interest in being important to a community that values a healthy, wholesome lifestyle.
- **Unfortunately, the excellent text is attached to a picture that screams stock photo.** Its generic personality zaps away any brand reinforcement the company could have engendered with its strong setup. Interestingly, the post did receive some strong engagement. I credit the good copy. The brand could have seen even more response had it just overlaid the Colgate logo and the text directly onto the picture. That might have even gone viral.

### KIT KAT: Timed Out

- Art, tone, logo, text—it’s all good: Posted the Friday before the 2013 Super Bowl Sunday, the art in Kit Kat’s status update is fun and creative, and with pitch-perfect tone the picture and art lend an entertaining voice to the global conversation.
- In the right-hand corner, they included their slogan, which is an excellent alternative to a company logo. More brands should use their slogan and consistently incorporate it into their social media efforts.
- The product is prominent and cleverly used; the text, the tagline, and the brand slogan echo each other; the cultural reference is universal. The only misstep is in the timing of the post.
- Thoughtless timing: **The Super Bowl in 2013 featured the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers. Kit Kat launched this post at 6 A.M.** Eastern Standard Time. In general, a 6 A.M. post is going to underindex because it only hits the early risers. Now, there were probably plenty of Ravens fans checking Facebook as they muddled through their early-morning routines, so it surely wasn’t a complete loss. But what about the 49ers fans in San Francisco? It was 3 A.M.

### LUKE’S LOBSTER: Logoless

- I love this place. But since the company’s timeline is filled with pictures of lobster rolls pretty much 365 days a week, it would have been a nice twist to show some mother flair on their Mother’s Day post. That’s the missed opportunity.
- The real problem, though, is that it would be easy for the speedy and casual observer to think that Cape Cod Potato Chips put out this post. Lots of brands post Facebook and Instagram shots that incorporate products from companies other than their own, and that’s fine—so long as you have prominently branded your photo with your company logo in a highly noticeable corner. Which you really should do. Every time.

### DONORS CHOOSE: A Solid Try

- This piece of content doesn’t have the branding elements or many of the important details I’ve demanded from other businesses, but so few nonprofits do anything on Facebook but throw right hooks asking for money or inviting people to fund-raising galas that I wanted to give some love to Donors Choose for throwing this jab.
- In fact, they generally post a lot of status updates that show they’re committed to jabs. I know nothing about this NGO or how it is run, but this quote seems thematically appropriate and tied to their mission.
- Sure, it’s generic, but who knows, maybe they’ll read this book and learn how to take their content up a notch. While they’re at it, they can put some additional effort into their community management, which is currently almost nonexistent. If there’s any place where people need to feel a strong sense of humanity, it’s from the nonprofit world.

### INSTAGRAM: A Textbook Case, and Not in a Good Way

As you’d expect, Instagram’s Facebook page is filled with stunning visuals, and this one accompanying a list of Instagrammers exhibiting their work at the Venice Biennale is gorgeous. The announcement itself, though, shows that when Facebook bought Instagram, they didn’t give their new employees a tutorial on how to properly storytell on their own platform. How could a subsidiary of Facebook post such copy-heavy images? There’s not even a punch line or pitch. Instagram may as well have thrown up a textbook on their timeline for all the excitement that post inspires.

### CONE PALACE: Yum

- I need to thank Cone Palace for giving me a chance to offer an in-depth commentary at what spot-on micro-content strategy looks like. Cone Palace is an institution in Kokomo, Indiana. I can’t speak about the food from experience, but if its owners pay as much attention to the quality and taste of their food as they do to their Facebook marketing strategy, it’s no doubt a good reason why they’ve stayed in business since 1966.
- Cone Palace earned about two thousand fans as soon as they launched their Facebook page by promoting a big event and offering a 10 percent discount. But though people joined to become part of the community, they probably stayed because of the good content. Their standards are high and exacting. **Before posting anything, they ask themselves, “If I saw this picture, would I share it?” If the answer is no, they don’t post.**
- **Their posts aren’t complicated, and they only put out two kinds—photographs of their food, and text posts announcing specials and new menu items, or that use local events (including people’s birthdays), the weather, and holidays to provide context for their business.** Hard-core analytical types might not trust Cone Palace’s sometimes anecdotal, unscientific methods for measuring ROI, but when they post a picture of a hamburger and fries, and fans post comments that they’re drooling and coming in for lunch, it seems safe to say that the content effectively increases sales.
- And what content! Originally, staff took iPhone pictures of the food. But then they noticed that on the occasion when they had a particularly great quality photo, their engagements and interactions shot up. So they invested in a professional photographer who takes all of their food shots.
- I would never have had the audacity to recommend to every business, especially a small mom-and-pop shop, that they should hire a professional photographer to take pictures of their product for social media content, because of the tremendous overhead it would represent, but secretly that’s exactly what I wish every business would do.
- And you know, if you’ve got the will, there is always a way. Ever heard of bartering? That’s an idea we need to take more seriously. When I think back, I could have bartered wine in exchange for professional shots of wine labels in a heartbeat if I had wanted to.
- If you’re a small business—a shoe salesperson, a lawyer, an electrician, or maybe a real estate agent—you can provide a service or product in exchange for another service or product that you need, like professional photographs.
- It would be such a worthwhile investment. A beautiful photo of your product makes all the difference in the world. Flip ahead to the picture of the apple turnover on Arby’s Pinterest board on page 128—would you rather eat there, or at Cone Palace?
- There is one thing Cone Palace could have done better: When that generic photo of a banana split whizzed through people’s newsfeed, it would have been smart for consumers to see a Cone Palace logo in the bottom of the picture or at the top left. INCLUDE YOUR LOGO IN YOUR PICTURE!
- Kudos to a business that has figured out how to innovate and evolve for a half century, and shows no signs of stopping.
