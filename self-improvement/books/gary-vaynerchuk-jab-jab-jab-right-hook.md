# Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook

## INTRODUCTION:

- Fast-paced, competitive, and aggressive, boxing is a natural metaphor for doing business. I hear it in boardrooms all the time. When managers and marketers outline their social media strategies, they often talk about the “knockout punch” or “right hook”—their next highly anticipated sale or campaign—that’s going to put the competition out for the count.
- I’ve been on a mission to convince marketers that today, business is all about making the customer happy.
- After spending so much time preaching the importance of the jab—the one conversation, one engagement at a time that slowly but authentically builds relationships between brands and customers—the last thing I wanted to do was write a book that outlines how to execute a killer right hook with content.
- And I was thinking back to Wine Library TV, the online wine video blog that launched my career in social media marketing and helped pave the way to where I am now.
  - I've always credited the success of that venture to my hustle and single-minded dedication to engaging with my fans and customers by answering every email or blog comment I received and going overboard to show my appreciation for their business.
  - The content. When I launched Wine Library TV, I chose to do long-form video blogs, about twenty minutes apiece, on a platform  where asking people to stick around for five minutes was like asking them to sit through the desert scene in the uncut version of Lawrence of Arabia.
  - And yet they had stuck around, relaxing with their feet up in front of their computers, to watch me taste wine and hear my opinions. Why? Maybe Wine Library TV didn’t catch fire just because I hustled more than everybody else. My high-quality content definitely factored in, but that might not have mattered had I not also made native content—authentic content perfectly crafted for that particular new platform, not thanks to good lighting or smart editing, but because it embraced authenticity and “realness.” And maybe I needed to make sure that my clients and others who turned to me for advice were doing the same.
  - No matter who you are or what kind of company or organization you work for, your number-one job is to tell your story to the consumer wherever they are, and preferably at the moment they are deciding to make a purchase.
  - But the secret sauce remains the same: The incredible brand awareness and bottom-line profits achievable through social media marketing require hustle, heart, sincerity, constant engagement, long-term commitment, and most of all, artful and strategic storytelling. Don’t ever forget it, no matter what you learn here.

## ROUND 1:

- Over the last half decade, marketers have learned to divide their campaigns into three categories—traditional, digital, and social. Social media is cannibalizing digital media, too.
- The evidence is clear. Emails, banner ads, search engine optimization (SEO)—the power of all these stalwart digital marketing tactics of the Internet era is diminishing, with one exception: when the digital platform has a social media component.
- It's natural that every new marketing platform would usurp the one that came before. Radio over print, TV over radio, Internet from everything.
- ***Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a small business, or a Fortune 500 company, great marketing is all about telling your story in such a way that it compels people to buy what you are selling.***
- Traditional marketing: filled with right hooks, and there was no other place for customers to consume their media.
- Social media gives the customers back the advantage, because they can leave.
- New marketing: there is no individual six-month campaign, there's only the 365-day campaign, where you produce new content daily.
- Now, if you know what you’re doing, you scour the Internet daily, searching for references to your product or service so you can jump in on the conversation, or scrambling at a moment’s notice to respond to a 2:47 P.M. complaint via Twitter.
- Because you can't recognize if something really worked immediately, a lot of social media marketing people are still questioning the value of their platforms, and few respect them enough to fully invest, either financially or philosophically.
- Smart ents see things like bikini shots in Snapchat and think, how can they do better?
- You cannot win big in social media if you’re going to be afraid of emerging technology.
- If, whenever they approached a platform, more marketers prepared their stories with the same intensity as boxers, they'd create much better content. Like great boxers, great storytellers are observant and self-aware.
- The real-time feedback that social media makes possible allows brands and businesses to test and retest, with scientific precision, what content connects with their audience, and what leaves them cold.
- Ignoring the deep analytics available for your fan page through Facebook (and through other platforms soon) is the equivalent of stepping into the ring without even having watched a video of your opponent during a fight.

### WHAT MAKES A GREAT STORY?

- A great marketing story is one that sells stuff. It creates an emotion that makes consumers want to do what you ask them to do. Your story isn't powerful enough if all it does is lead the horse to water; it has to inspire the horse to drink, too. On social media, the only story that can achieve that goal is one told with native content.
- Native content amps up your story’s power. Email marketing was a form of native content. It worked well during the 1990s because people were already on email; if you told your story natively and provided consumers with something they valued on that platform, you got their attention. And if you jabbed enough to put them in a purchasing mind-set, you converted. The rules are the same now that people spend their time on social media.
- It can’t tell you what story to tell, but it can inform you how your consumer wants to hear it, when he wants to hear it, and what will most make him want to buy from you. For example, supermarkets or fast-casual restaurants know from radio data that one of the ideal times to run an ad on the radio is around 5:00 P.M., when moms are picking up the kids and deciding what to make for dinner, and even whether they have the energy to cook.
- Social gives you the same kind of insight. Maybe the data tells you that you should post on Facebook early in the morning before people settle into the workplace, and then again at noon when they’re taking a lunch break. The better you learn the psychology and habits of your social media consumers, the better you can tell the right story at the right time.
- At one point it might be “Our barbecue sauce will win you first prize at the chili cook-off,” but later you might decide it’s more important to tell the story that “our barbecue sauce has all-natural, locally sourced ingredients.” How did MasterCard know the time was right for the “Priceless” campaign? Nike had tried a number of stories before it hit on “Just Do It.” There are a number of tropes that often work, but ultimately the story that you decide needs telling can change from day to day, even from hour to hour. The perfect story is spun from your intimate knowledge of your history, your competition’s history, and increasingly, what you see going on in the world and what you discover your consumers want to talk about.
- Native storytelling doesn’t require you to alter your identity to suit a given platform; your identity remains the same no matter what. Different platforms allow you to highlight different aspects of your brand identity, and each jab you make can tell a different part of your story.
- One of the biggest mistakes big brands make is to insist that their tone remain exactly the same no matter what platform they’re using. In clinging to this outdated model, they’re missing out on one of the greatest benefits of social media—always having more than one option.
- Entrepreneurs will have an easier time taking advantage of these options because they aren’t bogged down by the same red tape as Fortune 500 companies. While entrepreneurs and start-ups can respond with ease to real-time consumer feedback, corporate companies usually take a long time to steer their big old ships around.

### THE SWEET SCIENCE

- Social media storytelling is as sweet a science as boxing, requiring constant experimentation and hours of observation.
- Successful online content marketers pay especially close attention to variables such as environmental fluctuations and demographic shifts.
- At what times do we see the highest level of response? What happens when we use slang? How does the same image work with different taglines? Did it make a difference to add a hashtag? Is there an increase in engagement when we put out animated GIFs?
- The answers are out there if you learn how to test properly and correctly interpret the data.
- You can see right away how many people heart on Instagram; how many fans share and comment on Facebook; who repins on Pinterest and how often; how many people reblog and write notes on Tumblr.
- Similarly, each platform is unique, and requires a unique formula. What works on Facebook won’t necessarily work on Twitter.
- Today’s perfect right hooks always include three characteristics:
  - **They make the call to action simple and easy to understand.**
  - **They are perfectly crafted for mobile, as well as all digital devices.**
  - **They respect the nuances of the social network for which you are making the content.**

## ROUND 2: The CHARACTERISTICS of GREAT CONTENT and COMPELLING STORIES

### 1. IT’S NATIVE

- Content is king, but context is God. You can put out good content, but if it ignores the context of the platform on which it appears, it can still fall flat.
- **Most marketers are oblivious to context because marketers are on social media to sell stuff.**
- Consumers, however, are not. They are there for value.
- What is native to a platform? Depends on the platform. Tumblr attracts the artsy crowd and supports animated GIFs (short, rolling loops of video). So would a low-quality photograph on glossy, picture-perfect Pinterest. Twitter speaks to an ironic, urban audience that loves hashtags. An earnest post like “We love our customers!” would probably be soundly ignored. It sounds funny here, and yet posts like these are everywhere, proving that most brands are ignorant about what is native to a platform.
- You already know that successful social media marketing requires throwing many jabs before converting the sale with a right hook.
- Counter-intuitively, the most effective jabs are actually the gentlest. They are thrown with “native” content, which seamlessly blends in with the platform’s offerings and tells stories that engage the consumer at an emotional level. From the outside, jabbing with this kind of content won’t look or feel like the setup for that selling right hook, but it is, because the long-term financial worth of a person’s smile, giggle, snort, and even her tears is invaluable.
- Infomercials and advertorials are usually ridiculed because of their poor production value, but is' more because they have right hooks all over them. They’re informative and entertaining, like a jab, but they’re there to sell. Whether the brand places its ad on a TV screen or in a magazine, it makes sure to plaster a huge phone number and URL across the bottom. And even if those obvious signs weren’t there, the whole tone of the piece is that of a sales pitch.
- Native content, however, is not cheesy when it’s done right, nor is it obvious. What it is, really, is cool. It's whatever hits your emotional center so hard you have to share it with someone else. It can be a quote, a picture, an idea, an article, a comic strip, a song, a spoof, but whatever it is, it says as much about you, the person sharing it, as it does about the brand or business that originated it. There is no formula for cool content, other than that you can’t make it if you don’t have a deep understanding of what makes your audience tick and what they’re seeking when they use social media.
- Creating skillful native content has little to do with selling and a lot to do with skillful storytelling. In the right social-media-savvy hands, a brand that masters native content becomes human.

### 2. IT DOESN’T INTERRUPT

- The Keebler Elves, the Trix bunny, the Yoplait ladies one-upping each other with ecstatic proclamations of how good the yogurt is—they were all created to entertain, so that the next time you were in the mood for cereal or a snack, you’d remember the funny ad and be compelled to try the product.
- Ads and marketing are supposed to make consumers feel something and then act on that feeling. In that regard, the content marketers create today is similar to what it would have been fifty years ago.
- Where it should differ, however, is in the way it affects, or rather, doesn’t affect, your consumer’s media experience.
- Despite being the strong, silent type, the Marlboro Man was still an intruder. People would be watching Bonanza and then there he’d be, interrupting their program to sell them cigarettes.
- No matter how good the ads were, there was a distinct break between the show people were watching and the ad. But today marketers don’t have to intrude on the consumer’s entertainment. In fact, it’s imperative that we don’t. People have no patience for it anymore, as evidenced by the speed with which they jumped on the chance to bypass advertising altogether with the advent of DVRs in the late 1990s, and other commercial-skipping devices.
- **If we want to talk to people while they consume their entertainment, we have to actually be their entertainment, melding seamlessly into the entertainment experience.** Or the news experience. Or the friends-and-family experience. Or the design experience. Or the networking experience. Whatever experience people are seeking on their preferred platforms, that’s what marketers should attempt to replicate. They may not be in a buying frame of mind today, but you never know about tomorrow, and they will be far more likely to make a purchase from a brand they believe understands them and represents what they value than one to which they have no emotional connection.

### 3. IT DOESN’T MAKE DEMANDS—OFTEN

- Make it for your customer or your audience, not for yourself.
- Be generous. Be informative. Be funny. Be inspiring. Be all the characteristics we enjoy in other human beings. That’s what jabs are all about.
- Right hooks represent what is valuable to you—getting the sale, getting people in the door. Jabs are about what is valuable to the consumer. How do you know what content people find valuable? Look on their phones. Phone home screens show you everything you need to know about what kind of content people value. In general, the three most popular app categories are:
  - **Social networks, which tells you that people are interested in other people.**
  - **Entertainment, including games and music apps, which tells you that people want to escape.**
  - **Utility, including maps, notepads, organizers, and weight loss management systems, which tells you that people value service.**
  - Much of your content should fall within one of these three categories. A cosmetics company could easily tell a story about utility by giving their customers short videos (under fifteen seconds) on Facebook on how to properly apply their makeup, or put out an infographic on Pinterest illustrating the interesting facts about their product history and how women have used it over time.
  - But how would a cosmetics company provide entertainment? If it’s selling to eighteen- to twenty-five-year-old females, it could post demos of new music that appeals to eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds, and deconstruct female music stars’ stage makeup, maybe admiring the risks they take and explaining how people could try to get the same toned-down effect at home.
  - As for how the company can tap into its customers’ desire to interact with people, it just needs to be human. It needs to get in on conversations, find shared interests with consumers, and respond and react to what people are saying, not just about the brand per se, but about related topics, like how women can erase the signs of fatigue and stress before a big presentation even when they’ve been up since three in the morning with a baby, or what age is appropriate for girls to start shaping their eyebrows.
  - It could also talk about unrelated topics. Just because its main product was makeup wouldn’t mean that it couldn’t also talk about gaming or food, because it’s possible that fans could be enthusiastic about those topics, too. Jabs can be anything that helps set up your “commercial ask.”
- When you deliver a precise jab with native content, it might take your consumer a split second before he realizes that the story he’s paying attention to is being told by a brand, not an individual. Yet if your content is great, the realization won’t piss him off. Instead, he’ll appreciate what you’re offering. Because when you jab, you’re not selling anything.
- You’re not asking your consumer for a commitment. You’re just sharing a moment together. Something, anything, except a sales pitch. Skillful, native storytelling increases the likelihood that a person will share your content with a friend, thus increasing the likelihood of that friend remembering your brand the next time she decides she needs whatever it is you sell.
- The emotional connection you build through jabbing pays off on the day you decide to throw the right hook.
- **No way is a consumer going to say yes if you ambush him with a giant pop-up that blacks out the middle of the Web page he’s reading.**

### 4. IT LEVERAGES POP CULTURE

- If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. The young generation isn’t the only one consuming their culture via phone, either. Everyone is, including the ones who used to listen to their music on records, cassettes, and CDs. So use that to your advantage. Show your fans, whoever they are, that you love the same music they do.
- Prove that you understand them by staying on top of the gossip about celebrities from their generation. Create content that reveals your understanding of the issues and news that matter to them. Just don’t place it in a mobile banner ad.
- **The days of stopping people from what they’re doing to look at your ad are at best diminishing, and more than likely over, and regardless are overpriced for the ROI.**

### 5. IT’S MICRO

- There is something else you could do as you reevaluate your social media creative: stop thinking about your content as content. Think about it, rather, as micro-content—tiny, unique nuggets of information, humor, commentary, or inspiration that you reimagine every day, even every hour, as you respond to today’s culture, conversations, and current events in real time in a platform’s native language and format.
- Did the micro-content offer consumers anything of value, as a proper jab should? It’s unlikely it would have received any attention if it hadn't. Don’t underestimate the value of a fun surprise, a grin, and a sudden craving for chocolate and shortening.
- For a few days, the whole world, in traditional media and social, had positive things to say about Oreo. At the very least, everyone who saw it got the chance to say they witnessed the beginning of a new era in marketing.
- The next time a brand responds in real time, will the Twittersphere go crazy? Probably not, which is why it’s good to be first to market, even on platforms that don’t appear to have tremendous value at first glance. Your job as a marketer is not just about selling more product (though that’s a priority, and don’t forget it), but increasingly about making sure that you are first to market as often as possible in terms of timing, the quality of your micro-content, and the originality with which you respond to the world around you.
- `Micro-Content + Community Management = Effective Social Media Marketing`
  - Businesses can forge a direct connection between their community and their brand when they stop thinking about social media as the backup to the main events. It should be a main event in and of itself, serving as the nexus connecting every other channel by which businesses talk to their customers.
- There’s no reason for marketers to draft new overarching social media campaigns every year. Everyone’s should be as simple as this:
  - Jab at people, all the time, every day.
  - Talk about what they’re talking about.
  - When they start talking about something different, talk about that instead.
  - Not every brand has to jab at the same rate as its competitor. Remember, quality and quantity—some brands can get away with just a few jabs here and there; others need to jab all the time.
  - Successful storytelling builds brand equity, and businesses with high brand equity don’t need to draw as much attention to themselves and their achievements as those that are still establishing their value to the consumer.

### 6. IT’S CONSISTENT AND SELF-AWARE

- Though your business’s micro-content will vary wildly every day, it must consistently answer the question “Who are we?” You can and should learn to speak as many languages as possible, but no matter which language you’re using, your core story must remain constant.
- When you know your message, it’s easy to keep it consistent in every setting. No marketer should find this a daunting concept—we do it every day when we navigate the analog world. You’re going to wear a different outfit and use different vocabulary when you’re sitting down for tea with your grandmother in her home than when you’re living it up with friends in a nightclub. Creating micro-content is simply a way for your brand to adapt according to the circumstances and the whims of your audience.
- When you create stellar content native to a platform’s context, you can make a person feel; if your content can make a person feel, he is likely to share it with others, providing you with amplified word of mouth at a fraction of the cost of most other media. You could spend a million dollars to acquire committed fans on Facebook, and that would be money well spent, but if you also storytell properly, the only additional cost you’ll have is for the nonworking creative.
- Your content simply lives on, replicating itself over and over as your fans and followers pass it along through word of mouth, diminishing your costs with every retweet, share, pin, heart, and post.
- The concept of owning content and relationships instead of renting them has gained enormous traction with the start-up entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, but it has been slower to infiltrate the mind-set of most Fortune 500 companies and traditional small businesses around the world. That’s going to change once they realize that they are no longer beholden to media companies to disseminate their content and connect with their consumers. Thanks to social media, they’ll be able to do it all by themselves. Some already are, as we’ll see in the upcoming chapters.

## ROUND 3:

### STORYTELL on FACEBOOK

- Let me say that again: ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE PAGE VIEWS IN THE UNITED STATES IS ON FACEBOOK!
- Think about why people go to Facebook: to connect, socialize, and catch up on what the people they know and presumably care about are doing.
- In the process, they also find out what their friends and acquaintances are reading, listening to, wearing, and eating; what causes they are championing; what ideas they’re hatching; what jobs they’re hunting; and where they are going.
- **Facebook wants users to see things that they find relevant, fun, and useful, not annoying and pointless, or else they’ll abandon the site. Which means you’d better create content that’s relevant, fun, and useful, too.**
- The very thing that makes marketers want to have a presence on Facebook—the sheer number of users—makes the platform a marketing challenge. A billion users, and all the content they generate, creates a conundrum: with so many pieces of content streaming into consumers’ News Feeds and competing for attention, it’s unlikely they will see any content you post, even the good stuff.
- Facebook knows this. Long ago, when college students were the biggest population on Facebook and the user pool was relatively small, people’s News Feeds were organized chronologically. But as the user base grew—and grew and grew—Facebook had to figure out how to prevent users’ streams from getting clogged up with posts they weren’t interested in.

- To help mitigate the consequences of literal TMI, Facebook finally settled on an algorithm called EdgeRank. Every interaction a person has with Facebook, from posting a status update or a photo, to liking, sharing, or commenting, is called an “edge,” and theoretically, every edge channels into the news stream. But not everyone who could see these edges actually does, because EdgeRank is constantly reading algorithmic tea leaves to determine which edges are most interesting to the most number of people. It tracks all the engagement a user’s own content receives, as well as the engagement a user has with other people’s or brands’ content.
- The more engagement a user has with a piece of content, the stronger EdgeRank believes that user’s interest will be in similar content, and it filters that person’s news stream accordingly (a randomizer ensures that occasionally we’ll see a post from someone we haven’t talked to in years, thus keeping Facebook fresh and surprising).
- **For example, EdgeRank makes sure that a user who often likes or comments on a friend’s photos, but who ignores that friend’s plain-text status updates, will see more of that friend’s photos and fewer of his status updates.**

- Here’s why: Through EdgeRank, Facebook weighs likes, comments, and shares, but it currently does not give greater weight to click-throughs or any other action that leads to sales.
- Facebook’s greatest priority is making the platform valuable to the consumer, not to you, the marketer.
- What it cares about is whether people are interested in the content they see on Facebook, because if they’re interested, they’ll come back.
- What proves interest? Likes, comments, shares, and clicks—not purchases.
- You could put out a piece of content with a hyperlink to your product page that garners $2 million in sales in thirty minutes.
- On Facebook, the definition of great content is not the content that makes the most sales, but the content that people most want to share with others.
- Unfortunately, while it tries hard to guess what is important to users, Facebook still can’t determine their intent. Which action, or edge, indicates more interest—commenting on a post or liking a post? If a person actually clicks on a picture, is she showing more interest than if she shares it? Is a picture more valuable than a video? Does liking a video post show equal interest as watching the entire video? Facebook doesn’t know, but it desperately wants to, so it keeps tweaking the algorithm to figure the mystery out.

### JABS IN ACTION

- As the CMO of the boot company stands there looking, at best, curious and, at worst, furious, you will calmly point to the analytics (called Page Insights), which will reveal that that particular post is getting higher than usual engagement over more traditional boot-centered posts, just as you thought it would. Why? Because through previous jabs asking things like “What’s your favorite TV show?” you had already gathered the consumer insight that 80 percent of your fans were crazy about 30 Rock. And you knew that the series finale was approaching. So by putting out a “Good-bye, 30 Rock” piece, you are connecting with your community and showing them that not only do you get them, but you are one of them.
- All of a sudden your brand is talking like a human being, not a boot company. And as the overindexing (meaning a post performs above normal for that brand) reveals, people like that. They respond.
- This is good for you, because the uptick in engagement tells Facebook that this brand matters to people. Nor is the next one, a Valentine’s Day card that doesn’t show a single boot. Then you put out another three or four pieces of content that don’t sell anything, either, like this:
- Third jab: Post—A fifteen-second video about rock climbing.
- Fourth jab: Poll—“Would you rather wear your boots in the summer or the winter?”
- The point is to give and give and give, for no other reason than to entertain your customers and make them feel like you get them.
- And the more you give, the more you really will get them.
- Before, every piece of content had to be a right hook because all we knew about customers who bought boots was that they needed protective footwear.
- By testing and jabbing and giving, we learn what they find entertaining. Content that entertains sees engagement. Content that sees engagement tells Facebook and the rest of the world that your customers care about your brand, so that when you finally do put out something that would directly benefit your bottom line—a coupon, a free-shipping offer, or some other call to action—4 percent of your community sees it instead of a half percent, which gives you a much better chance at making a sale.

### TARGET YOUR JABS AND RIGHT HOOKS

- On any other platform, where your posts are entirely public, every jab hits everyone in the face. On Facebook, however, you can be extremely selective, customizing your jabs and targeting subsets of your fan base.
- Now, you could post the piece to your fifty-five-year-old male customers if you change the content so that it resonates with them.

### SMART SPENDING

- It’s worth taking a step back and examining the cost-effectiveness of this scenario. With very little lead time, a retailer can create two distinct pieces of content, send it directly to two separate demographics, and watch in real time to see how the recipients respond. If the excited comments start to pile up, or the content starts getting shared, that retailer knows the right hook made its mark.
- Now, there’s nothing wrong with spending money when you’re spending it smartly. All along you’ve probably been buying the Facebook ads that line up along the right side of the site. On average, the cost of running an ad on the right side of the page on Facebook runs the gamut between $.50 to $1.50 per like, though depending on the specificity of your targeting, the length of your campaign, and your budget it’s possible to acquire likes for as low as $.10 and as high as several dollars. That’s a steal, even when you compare it to the cost of email acquisition, which can run as low as $0.49. How can a dollar spent acquiring a Facebook fan be worth more than forty-nine cents anywhere else? Because a social user on your fan page has more potential reach than anywhere else.

### SPONSORED STORIES

- Sponsored stories were launched in early 2011, but it was in the fall of 2012 that they came into their own, mostly because Facebook announced that it was finally making an algorithmic adjustment that would purposely limit how many people would organically see a brand’s posts, even if they had already become fans by liking the brand’s page.
- Until recently, though the algorithm was calibrated to limit spam or uninteresting content, good content could still organically reach a large percentage of fans.
- **As of September 2013, however, Facebook’s algorithm will only allow your content to reach about 3–5 percent of your fans. To reach more, you have to post some extremely engaging content. Or, you have to pay. In this way, Facebook is able to protect the consumer’s experience by raising the barrier to entry to the News Feed.**
- I didn't understand people’s fury. Marketers and business owners who would never get mad about paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a network to get their ad on TV, even when they’d never know whether the ad had gotten anyone’s attention, were having coronaries over having to pay for the same kind of distribution.
  - Create great content that gets people to engage and Facebook will let you show that content to more and more people. Create content no one cares about and Facebook will make it as difficult as possible for you put more of it out on its site.
  - Sponsored stories is a superior ad platform because it rewards nimbleness and quick reaction. When it shows us that a piece of content is resonating, we know to spend money on it. It’s so clear. Let’s say that on average about 20 percent of the people who received my emails back then actually opened them, and one day I sent out an email that saw a 21 percent open rate. Then I saw that the wine mentioned in that email was suddenly selling extremely well. Clearly something about that email had made it extra valuable to my audience. How much would that knowledge have been worth?
  - I would have happily paid Yahoo, Gmail, and Hotmail a premium to make sure that the next time I sent out that email, as many people as possible saw it, whether it was by working around spam filters or finding a way for the emails to automatically open when people went to their email accounts. A service like that would have been the greatest marketing tool in the world—heck, are you listening, Google?—and it’s close to what you can achieve through Facebook sponsored stories.

- Facebook is shockingly bad at explaining sponsored stories, so let me try here. There are two types. One simply extends your chosen piece of content to the news streams of a larger number of your fans than the regular 3–5 percent that would normally see it. That’s called a Page Post. The other extends your reach the same way, but it allows you to highlight the fact that a fan has engaged with your content and tell that fan’s friends about it.
- You can choose to create this kind of sponsored story around a check-in, a like, and several other actions such as when someone shares a story from your app or your website.
- **For example, if a fan checked in to a hotel, or claimed an offer from a T-shirt company, the hotel or T-shirt company could pay to make sure that friends of that fan knew about it, not with an ad lingering on the periphery of the Facebook page that no one but PC users will see, but within the actual newsfeed.**
- Before, when we created ads around a post, as soon as it migrated to the right side of the page the format of the post would change. This transformation compromised the impact of the creative work because it no longer looked like an organic piece of content created by someone you knew, but like an ad created by some stranger.
- But now marketers can keep the creative that we already know works organically, and enhance its power simply by paying to have more people see it, offering us an unparalleled opportunity to connect with active fans as well as reinvigorate relationships with fans that might have gone dormant over time.

- **Sponsored stories work like this: When I sponsor the story, a higher number of people than normally follow my page will see it in their News Feed.** Now they are reminded about me. If the content is actually good enough to compel them to act on that piece of content—liking, sharing, or commenting on it—they get brought back into my orbit, and Facebook believes I am relevant once again: “Facebook users like GaryVee, so I’m going to give them more GaryVee.” Now the next time I post a new piece of content, many more of those people will be likely to see it. Yet I won’t have had to pay any additional money to get those impressions.
- And if the engagement continues, my initial costs will continue to diminish as my impressions rise. It could trigger a snowball effect that could last well into the next month, and all for the price of one small sponsored story.
- What you get is extended reach and an additional layer of targeting above and beyond that of an ordinary post or targeted post, both of which are free. Put money behind a well-performing targeted post and turn it into a sponsored story, and you’ll increase the specificity with which you can target your audience.

### GREAT BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

- Facebook calculates the initial value of your sponsored story based on the competition you face for your targeted audience, and how much that competition is willing to pay. If you create a great ad that compels people to engage with you, Facebook will decide that your ad deserves priority over a competitor’s ad that isn’t as engaging. **In addition, when Facebook sees that people are interacting with your content, it will show that content to more people, because it is obviously enhancing the quality and entertainment value of the News Feed.**
- The second people stop clicking, though, Facebook will stop running the ad as a sponsored story. Unless, of course, you insist on throwing more money behind it. But why would you? Essentially, Facebook purposely makes it cost-inefficient to distribute bad creative.
- Facebook will, not because it’s nice enough to protect you from yourself, but because it’s savvy enough to protect itself from you. It’s in Facebook’s best interest for you to put out great content. It wants to monetize, but if users start feeling like they’re being spammed every time they go to the site, Facebook will suffer.
- If networks could show marketers data that proved that every time they showed the consumer a bad commercial, consumers turned off their TV, TV commercials would be better. That’s what Facebook, and all social media, can do for us. Ideally, when Facebook informs you that no one is interacting with your sponsored story, that’s your cue to stop and rework the piece, or chuck it altogether. Social media gives us real-time feedback from the consumer, which forces us to be better marketers, strategists, and service providers.
- Ultimately, the changes implemented to Facebook ads only changed how much it costs you to work with Facebook, not how you tell your story. If you’re a brand that understands how to jab in ways that bring value to your customers—giving them a moment of levity with a cartoon, or a game to play, or any other escapist content, which then primes them to be open to giving you business when you finally ask with a right hook—you’ll win.
- It’s possible that the platform will decide to start using actual purchases as indicators of fan interest more than the engagement of comments, likes, or shares. That could mean that Facebook becomes as much of a right hook platform as it is a jab platform. The last thing Facebook wants to become is a right hook platform, because it will die.
- My advice to marketers is to quit complaining and start creating micro-content worth the money it will take you to successfully reach the customers Facebook is now guarding so carefully. Figure out how to work the system and get the most bang for your buck.

### AIR CANADA: Ruining a Good Idea

- When Air Canada’s very first flight attendant, who worked for the airline from 1938 to 1943, died at the age of 102, Air Canada paid her tribute by posting her photograph and a link to an interview their in-flight magazine conducted with her about six months before her death. It should have been a successful jab that engaged a large number of their 400,000 fans. Unfortunately, they blew it.
  - It's not visually compelling.
  - It's burdened with too much text.
  - It's a link post when it should have been a picture post.
  - Yet the two big blocks of text surrounding it water down the impact of the photo. By uploading the photograph as a picture post instead of a link post, however, and overlaying the lines announcing Mrs. Garner Grant’s death onto the picture itself, Air Canada could have emphasized the photo and simultaneously explained why it was relevant.

### JEEP: Evoking the Right Emotions

- This picture perfectly encapsulates the Jeep brand. Jeep could not have chosen a better model than the pretty young woman in this photo, with her shades, her flying hair, and her huge smile evoking summer, fun, and freedom. What’s cool is that she’s not a model—she’s someone a fan named Megan Bryant photographed and posted on Facebook. The movement and mood of this picture are striking enough to be worth checking out more closely. One look, and you start to wish you had a Jeep, too.
- The only thing that could slightly improve this piece would have been to make sure that the copy, “It’s a Jeep Thing,” was more visible, perhaps by placing it onto the photo itself. With that small adjustment, Jeep would have delivered a powerful image, its logo, and its terrific tagline all in one shot. Otherwise, kudos to Jeep for such a beautiful, humanizing, and well-executed jab.

### MERCEDES-BENZ: A Great Product Deserved Better

- All they had to do was include one line of text about the car’s sumptuous interior, and then link out to the excellent Forbes article that told readers everything else they needed to know.
- Poorly placed call to action: In addition, they placed their call to action—the link to the article—at the bottom of that big paragraph of text. Why would they?
- No logo: As gorgeous as the car is, there’s no way to know who made it unless you think to look at the post’s profile picture. It wouldn’t have sacrificed any class or sophistication to make sure the Mercedes-Benz logo was tastefully inserted somewhere on the photo itself.

### SUBARU: Amateur Night

- There is so much to dislike about this piece of content it’s hard to know where to start.
- Whereas Mercedes-Benz talked too much, Subaru has said too little. The copy length is ideal, but there was no reason to skip the opportunity to hint that the review was a positive one. They’ve missed a chance to get the fans excited and make them want to read more.
- Terrible photo: Unless Subaru intended to sell pavement along with its cars, there is no reason why a wet road should dominate the entire lower half of the photograph.
- No logo: There’s no reason for anyone to take notice of this photograph, but even if it did somehow register, without a logo there is nothing to explain to people why this car deserves attention.
- While nothing could turn this pig’s ear into a silk purse, simply adding the Consumer Reports headline, a logo, and cropping the photo differently might turn this wasted opportunity into a serviceable jab.

### VICTORIA’S SECRET: Fluent in the Platform’s Language

- With this powerful right hook, Victoria’s Secret shows that they are fluent in native content–ese:
- Dramatic photo: Obviously it’s not just the wings this model is sporting that are going to get people—men who love what she’s showing, and women who wish they had what she’s showing—to screech to a halt in midscroll. But Victoria’s Secret made sure that the design of the photo was as captivating as its subject. The image is big and bold enough to swallow up both a PC screen and a mobile screen; the minimalist black-and-white adds drama; the hot pink script overlaid against the model’s wings is as eye-popping as her cleavage and the lingerie enhancing it.
- Good use of copy: The text in the photo was placed close to the center, so that even if the picture were cropped because of a small mobile screen, the text would remain visible. The copy is short and direct, but that line in parentheses delivers it with a little wink, which adds the dollop of personality and humor that is so necessary to any brand’s social efforts.
- Appropriate links: **After the words “Apply here,” Victoria’s Secret attaches a link that takes you directly to the page where you can register for an Angel Card, making it easy and fast to make the sale.** Is such a self-evident move really worth praise? You’d be amazed at how many brands set up a beautiful right hook, and then link to their general website, leaving customers fumbling around as they hunt for the appropriate tab so they can make their purchase.

### MINI COOPER: Inspiring a Spirit of Adventure

- Great voice: I love the voice in this piece. **In two lines, the status update promises that if you stick with Mini, you’ll find adventure.** The idea of driving with the top down through snow is so absurd, it’s almost impossible to resist clicking on the attached link to find out how Mini could act like this drive was the trip of a lifetime. And the line “Wrap up warm” adds to our curiosity by hinting that whatever lies behind that link will put to rest any doubts we might have as to how comfortable the experience could be.
- Lacks a logo: I’ll forgive Mini for neglecting to include a logo on the photograph it used for this Facebook piece because the Mini is an iconic car, recognizable even when photographed from the back, as in this image.

### ZARA: Bait and Switch

- Why it chose to fail those fans so badly with this useless post is incomprehensible. Let’s dissect why it is a complete waste of the brand’s and its fans’ time.
- Poor mobile optimization.
- Good copy: At least they got the copy right. "Just Apps" is short and sweet and tells you everything you need to know, which is that Zara has apps. Great. Where do I get me some? Ah, a link! I’m going to click on it. Now I can shop on the Zara official home page. But I wanted to download an app! Isn't that what you just announced, your apps? What the hell, Zara?
- The more a brand posts links to sites that don’t bring value to their customers, the more hesitant fans are going to be to click any links they see from that brand in the future. This Facebook post is a short-term fail for letting its fans down with a bait-and-switch post, and a potentially long-term fail for jeopardizing the respect and equity Zara has earned within its community.

### REGAL CINEMAS: Leveraging Their Brand

- No industry has a better stable of iconic images with which to leverage their brand than the film industry. Regal Cinemas, however, bucked the trend with this successful jab that pits two movie characters against each other.
- The picture: The theater’s marketing creatives probably sifted through thousands of pictures of each of these movie characters before deciding which ones to use, and they chose well. Even though Thornton Melon and Frank the Tank went back to school in films made almost twenty years apart, they’re clearly steeped in the same frat DNA.
- The copy: For once, the status update for this content doesn’t repeat the copy in the artwork. Instead, the headline of the picture sets up the question, and the status update reminds us of the characters’ names, just in case someone out there isn’t familiar with them.
- And yet, at the risk of repeating itself, the company could have seen even better engagement had they listed the names of each character under their photo, or at worst simply labeled them “A” or “B.” **Rule of thumb: Make it as easy as possible for your fans to engage! Why take the risk that someone won’t be able to come up with the characters’ names right away and therefore lose the opportunity to engage with them?**
- Yet again, no logo: Good for Regal Cinemas for remembering to build brand equity, but they would have been better off using a logo than a banner across the bottom of the art.** Few people are going to type out the movie theater’s URL, so a better use of their limited space would have been to include a sizable logo in the corner.** But that’s a minor criticism.

### PHILIPPINE AIRLINES: Totally Unappetizing

- People love to talk about food, so Philippine Airlines, which flies to lots of exotic destinations, had a good idea when it decided to ask its fans to describe their most exotic meal. But after having such a good idea, why did the company waste it?
- Poor use of the platform: It should go without saying that if you’re going to talk about food, and you have the option to post a photograph, you should post the damn photograph. It would have taken little effort to turn this content into something beautiful or fun.
- Toneless: With airplane food the butt of so many jokes, they couldn’t come up with a way to imply that Philippine Airlines knows a little bit about great food? The company simply made no attempt to make the question relevant to Philippine Airlines or its customers.
- Too many call-to-actions: **Finally, Philippine Airlines needs to remember that less is more. Doubling the number of calls to action made it more challenging to get people to answer the questions.** It seems crazy, but when people are moving through the stream as fast as they do now, two questions are too much. They should have been listed as two separate posts.

### SELENA GOMEZ: A Golden Touch

- Your phone and your fingers are together all the time, so why shouldn’t they complement each other? No wonder the hot new women’s fashion trend is to match your manicure to your phone case.
- The photo: It’s big and bold, very native to the Facebook platform. **With Selena’s glittery hand and phone swallowing up the camera, the picture would have been unmissable as fans scrolled through their news streams.**
- The copy: Celebrities are some of the worst social media abusers, and one of their biggest offenses is that they usually talk too much. Selena doesn't, and with this status update she was smart enough to keep her text short and playful.
- Shared more than 6,000 times and earning more than 220,000 likes, this sponsored story with Selena Gomez shows how far fans are willing to carry a brand’s content when you make them feel like everything you do is just for them.

### SHAKIRA: Falling Flat

- Wrong type of post: Remember how Selena’s photo exploded into your line of vision?
- This one you have to squint to see, because it’s a link post, not a photo post. When you attach YouTube links, the fill-out—the headline, link, and text—share as much space as the photo, minimizing the photo’s effectiveness.
- Poor photo: **The point of the post is to promote Shakira’s new perfume. So why are we seeing an image of her posing with a fan and a signed soccer jersey at a podium?** It’s great to show how comfortable and generous Shakira is with her fans, but this is the wrong image for the purpose of this content.
- The copy: First there’s the copy in English. Then there’s the copy in Spanish. And then there’s the description in the YouTube fill-out. This isn’t a novel, it’s a status update, and it’s supposed to be short. **Brands have always been able to post according to language and location, so there was no need to double up on languages in this post.** Especially when the content is so uninspiring.
- No engagement: **In addition, with the exception of one shout-out to her fans to thank them for liking her new Facebook page, there’s no engagement between the star and her fans.** That seems like a strange choice for someone who wants people to buy her perfume.
- The video: It’s six minutes long. No one in a Facebook mobile world has time to watch a six-minute video about your new perfume, no matter how much we like you.
- The whole package, if you can stand to sit through the entire length of it, is supposed to give us a peek into the whirlwind life of a star, while revealing her humanity. There are many ways that Shakira’s team could have accomplished this while bringing value to her fans.

### LIL WAYNE: Welcome to Spam City, USA

- There is no other way to start this review than to congratulate Lil Wayne for becoming the first person to successfully turn Facebook into Myspace.
- Poor page management: Allowing people to use your fan page to build up their own businesses and Facebook pages is an insult to all the core fans who come here to be a part of your community.
- It’s tough for me to make fun of Weezy because I love his music, but honestly, when you put this little effort into your social media promotion, you’re no better than the amateurs sticking promo fliers under people’s windshield wipers.

### MOSCOT: Possibly the Most Confusing Facebook Post Ever

- Text, text, and more problems with text: First, there’s the double copy supporting the photograph of Johnny Depp, in Hebrew and in English (though it takes some effort to find the English text). Facebook is not the place to be flooding fans with text.
- Indecipherable text: Second, the copy that does hit us in the face is in Hebrew. It’s kind of arresting, and when combined with the photo of Johnny Depp may be enough to make readers stop in their tracks. But not for long. As soon as most fans realize that they can’t read anything on the page—this is an American company, and most fans will be American—they’re going to move on.

### UNICEF: Giving Away Too Much, Too Soon

- Good imagery: UNICEF did a lot right here. They had their finger on the pop culture pulse and chose the right celebrity with the ever-popular Katy Perry. The picture of a smiling Katy jumping rope with some village girls in her UNICEF T-shirt is spot-on, and should work well to bring awareness to the brand.
- Botched copy: Where they goofed is in the copy. The first line is “Want to know what Katy Perry has been up to?” Good question. Provocative. Engaging. And UNICEF blew it by offering the answer.
- **The post should have ended with that first line, punctuated with a link.** Leaving the question hanging would have whetted visitors’ appetites for more, and kept them intrigued enough to follow UNICEF’s digital bread crumbs to their website, where they could have elaborated on their humanitarian work in Madagascar and other countries. Serving up the answer right away robbed the post of all its energy and style.

### LAND ROVER: Going Nowhere

- No brand ID: Don’t get me wrong, the execution is weird. Imagine this coming through your stream. You see a woman peering through a telescope at you, but with no logo and no prominently overlaid text, there’s no way to know what it’s about unless you pause to squint at the text below.
- Wrong URL: There, we see the post is from Land Rover, and that they’ve got something special planned and they’d like us to send in a passport-style photo to landroversocialmedia@gmail.com. Why didn’t Land Rover secure a .landrover email address instead of a Gmail address? In addition, one can only hope that they aren’t strict with their definition of “passport-style,” because the photo they used, with half the woman’s head blocked by a telescope, is not passport-style.
- Maybe that doesn’t matter, though, because when we click through the link that takes us to a page where we can read more about the project, they don’t reiterate the passport-style requirement.
- Go-nowhere link: This error in consistency is minor, however, compared with the fact that the link takes us from the company’s Facebook post straight to another company Facebook post. This tells me that the creative team wasn’t given the proper financial or managerial support to execute this project correctly with a proper website.
- Showing off scrappy entrepreneurial spirit and making do with the resources you've got is admirable for a start-up, but not for a company like Land Rover, which sells a fairly expensive product.

### STEVE NASH: A Disappointing Departure

- Nonnative design: Anyone who visited Nash’s fan page directly was invited to the Steve Nash Foundation “HOWDOW.” If they consumed this on their phone they saw it as an “OWDOW.” You’ve got to be smart about your status update art, and someone on Nash’s media team was not.
- Broken link: The URL attached to the update doesn’t link out, which means Nash is counting on fans cutting and pasting the link into their URL if they want to go to the Showdown website. I assure you all of zero people did that, which is too bad because it’s a beautiful website, not to mention an extremely cool and worthy cause.
- No spam control: The comment thread is littered with it. There’s a plague of people who use popular fan pages to promote themselves or their businesses, and the managers of these pages need to do a better job of weeding them out.
- All of these mistakes can only be a result of carelessness or laziness. Nash fans deserve better.

### AMTRAK: Using Sawdust to Its Advantage

- I ride Amtrak all the time, and this Facebook post made me glad that I do. I love this post—it’s one of the best jabs I’ve seen in a long time. Best of all, it allows me to dispel some confusion about what social media can and cannot do.
- Great use of sawdust: You’ve got to be damn smart to figure out how to take an image of something quite boring, even forgettable, like two train seats, and turn it into a fun, energizing piece of content. I call material like those train seats “sawdust”—assets that you have just lying around, maybe something you totally take for granted.
- Gamification: Not only did Amtrak take advantage of their sawdust, they gamified it. Tag who you’d like to travel with—that’s a fun, clever challenge that strikes an emotional punch (although it’s a fairly big ask that could give you unreliable results). And what a great way to take advantage of the platform. Every person who receives a notification that they’ve been tagged will immediately register the Amtrak brand. It’s a great way to build awareness even among people who may not already be fans.
- Authenticity: **There’s a real person behind this post, too. You can tell because when one fan suggested Justin Bieber as his preferred seatmate, Amtrak replied with “But where would Selena Gomez go?”** With one sentence, Amtrak reveals that its employees are our contemporaries, people just like us, with their fingers on the pop culture pulse, a sense of humor, and a real interest in their customers.
- The only criticism worth lobbing at Amtrak is that they chose a picture of some pretty worn-out seats. This brings me to the misconception a lot of marketers have about social media. It’s not lipstick. No matter how brilliant, clever, or authentic you are, nothing will cover up the flaws in your content. Some people will appreciate the retro look of the seats, but a lot of people won’t find them very appealing.

### BLACKBERRY: Missed Details Matter

- My team and I struggled for several minutes to understand the story behind this post. We liked a lot about it, but then we realized that if it was that challenging to figure out what BlackBerry was trying to say, the story couldn’t have registered much with an audience that probably spent less than a second thinking about it.
- Poor storytelling technique: I understand the story that BlackBerry was trying to tell—the BlackBerry Z10 is two phones in one—one for work, one for play. And if you click on the link below the picture, you’re taken to a pretty cool YouTube video that illustrates exactly what’s special about the phone. In addition, you’ll find another link that takes you to the product’s retail site. **But though the brand correctly chose to make its photo the star of the update, the image does not do enough of the storytelling for us.** Why not show someone attending a kid’s soccer game juxtaposed with a shot of that same person at the office? You have to look extremely closely to recognize the difference between the two screens. In addition, the text talks about work-life harmony, but the screens are reversed, in life-work order. That’s sloppy. **And finally, people live their whole lives looking at screens—now they have to look at screens on their screens?** It’s a little meta for a mobile device company.
- BlackBerry was right to make a big push for this product and tell their story in social, but they should have paid more attention to the details of their execution.

### MICROSOFT: Riding the Waves

- Good use of links: In this exciting jab, Microsoft is promoting a product called Fresh Paint, an app that allows you to use a palette of colors to “paint” in templates or even on your own pictures and photographs.
- Offers quality, value, and authenticity: The post shows that the creative team at Microsoft is doing some smart thinking about where the cultural conversation is going, and how they can find ways to be a part of it. The brand receives more high marks for the quality of the image, the fact that the voice of the text isn't too corporate, and the way they brought something of value to their community. In this status update and on the blog, Microsoft really does sound excited about both the movie and their product. If only more companies would use Facebook this well.

### ZEITGEIST: Missing Its Inner Hipster

- This post is stunningly bad. Hipsters have told me that Zeitgeist is the ultimate hipster bar in San Francisco. Ironically, everything that’s wrong with this jab could have been easily avoided if someone with a modicum of stereotypically hipster skills had created the post.
- Low Facebook value: First, the post in and of itself has zero value but to divert fans to Twitter. There’s no copy, just a mess of hashtags. Hashtags have infiltrated our culture so much that people are starting to use them as an ironic coda to status updates and even regular conversations. They have long been a huge part of Twitter and Instagram’s appeal, where they overindex, and recently Facebook introduced them to the platform as well. It’s possible that Zeitgeist was trying to incorporate hashtags into their voice, but they don’t work here.
- Incorrect post format: Next, it’s a link post, and at the time this post was created, link posts underperformed compared with picture posts that link out (though that could change in the future). In this case, though, a picture post wouldn’t have saved the status update. It might have even made it worse.
- Sorry photography: The picture is so dark and blurry you really have to work to see what it is. Zeitgeist is a hip brand whose demo is all about modern technology. Photography has become a kind of social currency. This is not a great photo. It’s not even good. It’s the kind of picture you delete and take again. It’s the kind of subliminal message that can kill a company.

### TARTINE BAKERY: One Hot Mess

- Unclear messaging: This post on the Tartine Bakery fan page is actually promoting an event at the bakery’s sister restaurant, Bar Tartine.
- It’s fine to cross-promote among communities, but they should have made it explicitly clear that this isn’t a bakery event, since most fans are coming to this fan page looking for bakery news.
- Awkward text: They write: “Bar Tartine (with Link!) hosts . . .” What an awkward, poorly written phrase. Plus, it shows that someone at Tartine actually believes that fans are too stupid to know what that little blue URL is for at the end of the post.
- Irrelevant hashtag: What’s up with the hashtag? The post doesn’t direct us to Twitter, so what purpose does it serve here?
- No photo: This is as visually unfriendly as it gets. Tartine is promoting a food-centered charitable event, and they couldn’t whet our appetites with a little teaser of food porn or some other cool image to get us excited about it?
- Insufficient page management: Finally, back on the fan page, the four spam comments—the only comments anyone bothered to make—are the cherries on top of this crap sundae.

### TWIX: Having Fun

- Twix threw a good jab here. They left their logo off the photograph, which is too bad, because as I have repeatedly pointed out, these images go through consumers’ mobile streams so quickly it’s easy for them to see a picture but not register who posted it.
- Clever storytelling, strong voice, good use of pop culture: In the past, Twix has run television ads that played on the crisp sound of a Twix snapping in two, and in this post they’re reinforcing that story by playing off the well-known “tree in the forest” philosophical riddle.
- It’s a cute idea. The text shows that the writer has a strong feel for the brand’s quirky, playful voice. The nice level of engagement the post received proves how appealing it is to customers when a brand skillfully inserts itself into the pop culture conversation to tell its story. They should be primed to respond whenever Twix gets ready to throw a right hook down the line.

### COLGATE: Good Copy Gone Bad

- Catchy text: “Did You Know?” in all caps works for me. Maybe I like the copy in this Colgate post because I grew up an ESPN SportsCenter fan. Regardless, this is an appropriately short, tight, positive reinforcement of the brand’s interest in being important to a community that values a healthy, wholesome lifestyle.
- **Unfortunately, the excellent text is attached to a picture that screams stock photo.** Its generic personality zaps away any brand reinforcement the company could have engendered with its strong setup. Interestingly, the post did receive some strong engagement. I credit the good copy. The brand could have seen even more response had it just overlaid the Colgate logo and the text directly onto the picture. That might have even gone viral.

### KIT KAT: Timed Out

- Art, tone, logo, text—it’s all good: Posted the Friday before the 2013 Super Bowl Sunday, the art in Kit Kat’s status update is fun and creative, and with pitch-perfect tone the picture and art lend an entertaining voice to the global conversation.
- In the right-hand corner, they included their slogan, which is an excellent alternative to a company logo. More brands should use their slogan and consistently incorporate it into their social media efforts.
- The product is prominent and cleverly used; the text, the tagline, and the brand slogan echo each other; the cultural reference is universal. The only misstep is in the timing of the post.
- Thoughtless timing: **The Super Bowl in 2013 featured the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers. Kit Kat launched this post at 6 A.M.** Eastern Standard Time. In general, a 6 A.M. post is going to underindex because it only hits the early risers. Now, there were probably plenty of Ravens fans checking Facebook as they muddled through their early-morning routines, so it surely wasn’t a complete loss. But what about the 49ers fans in San Francisco? It was 3 A.M.

### LUKE’S LOBSTER: Logoless

- I love this place. But since the company’s timeline is filled with pictures of lobster rolls pretty much 365 days a week, it would have been a nice twist to show some mother flair on their Mother’s Day post. That’s the missed opportunity.
- The real problem, though, is that it would be easy for the speedy and casual observer to think that Cape Cod Potato Chips put out this post. Lots of brands post Facebook and Instagram shots that incorporate products from companies other than their own, and that’s fine—so long as you have prominently branded your photo with your company logo in a highly noticeable corner. Which you really should do. Every time.

### DONORS CHOOSE: A Solid Try

- This piece of content doesn’t have the branding elements or many of the important details I’ve demanded from other businesses, but so few nonprofits do anything on Facebook but throw right hooks asking for money or inviting people to fund-raising galas that I wanted to give some love to Donors Choose for throwing this jab.
- In fact, they generally post a lot of status updates that show they’re committed to jabs. I know nothing about this NGO or how it is run, but this quote seems thematically appropriate and tied to their mission.
- Sure, it’s generic, but who knows, maybe they’ll read this book and learn how to take their content up a notch. While they’re at it, they can put some additional effort into their community management, which is currently almost nonexistent. If there’s any place where people need to feel a strong sense of humanity, it’s from the nonprofit world.

### INSTAGRAM: A Textbook Case, and Not in a Good Way

As you’d expect, Instagram’s Facebook page is filled with stunning visuals, and this one accompanying a list of Instagrammers exhibiting their work at the Venice Biennale is gorgeous. The announcement itself, though, shows that when Facebook bought Instagram, they didn’t give their new employees a tutorial on how to properly storytell on their own platform. How could a subsidiary of Facebook post such copy-heavy images? There’s not even a punch line or pitch. Instagram may as well have thrown up a textbook on their timeline for all the excitement that post inspires.

### CONE PALACE: Yum

- I need to thank Cone Palace for giving me a chance to offer an in-depth commentary at what spot-on micro-content strategy looks like. Cone Palace is an institution in Kokomo, Indiana. I can’t speak about the food from experience, but if its owners pay as much attention to the quality and taste of their food as they do to their Facebook marketing strategy, it’s no doubt a good reason why they’ve stayed in business since 1966.
- Cone Palace earned about two thousand fans as soon as they launched their Facebook page by promoting a big event and offering a 10 percent discount. But though people joined to become part of the community, they probably stayed because of the good content. Their standards are high and exacting. **Before posting anything, they ask themselves, “If I saw this picture, would I share it?” If the answer is no, they don’t post.**
- **Their posts aren’t complicated, and they only put out two kinds—photographs of their food, and text posts announcing specials and new menu items, or that use local events (including people’s birthdays), the weather, and holidays to provide context for their business.** Hard-core analytical types might not trust Cone Palace’s sometimes anecdotal, unscientific methods for measuring ROI, but when they post a picture of a hamburger and fries, and fans post comments that they’re drooling and coming in for lunch, it seems safe to say that the content effectively increases sales.
- And what content! Originally, staff took iPhone pictures of the food. But then they noticed that on the occasion when they had a particularly great quality photo, their engagements and interactions shot up. So they invested in a professional photographer who takes all of their food shots.
- I would never have had the audacity to recommend to every business, especially a small mom-and-pop shop, that they should hire a professional photographer to take pictures of their product for social media content, because of the tremendous overhead it would represent, but secretly that’s exactly what I wish every business would do.
- And you know, if you’ve got the will, there is always a way. Ever heard of bartering? That’s an idea we need to take more seriously. When I think back, I could have bartered wine in exchange for professional shots of wine labels in a heartbeat if I had wanted to.
- If you’re a small business—a shoe salesperson, a lawyer, an electrician, or maybe a real estate agent—you can provide a service or product in exchange for another service or product that you need, like professional photographs.
- It would be such a worthwhile investment. A beautiful photo of your product makes all the difference in the world. Flip ahead to the picture of the apple turnover on Arby’s Pinterest board on page 128—would you rather eat there, or at Cone Palace?
- There is one thing Cone Palace could have done better: When that generic photo of a banana split whizzed through people’s newsfeed, it would have been smart for consumers to see a Cone Palace logo in the bottom of the picture or at the top left. INCLUDE YOUR LOGO IN YOUR PICTURE!
- Kudos to a business that has figured out how to innovate and evolve for a half century, and shows no signs of stopping.

### Questions to Ask When Creating Facebook Micro-Content

- Is the text too long?
- Is it provocative, entertaining, or surprising?
- Is the photo striking and high-quality?
- Is the logo visible?
- Have we chosen the right format for the post?
- Is the call to action in the right place?
- Is this interesting in any way, to anyone? For real?
- Are we asking too much of the person consuming the content?

## ROUND 4: LISTEN WELL on TWITTER

- Yet discussing Twitter poses a problem for a book dedicated to improving social media content, because on this platform, and this platform alone, content often has far less value than context. A brand’s success on Twitter is rarely predicated on the actual content it produces. Rather, it correlates with how much valuable context you add to the content—your own, and that produced by others.
- The main mistake most marketers make is to use Twitter primarily as an extension of their blog, a place to push a link to content they have posted elsewhere.
- They’ll also often use it as a place to brag, especially by retweeting favorable things people say about them, a new form of humblebragging I call a “birdiebrag.”
- **Twitter primarily rewards people who listen and give, not those who ask and take.** Much of the time, to read a Twitter feed is to read a mind-numbing number of right hooks. Yet if there has ever been a platform where engagement and community management have power, it’s this one. There’s a lot of talking and selling on Twitter, but not enough engagement, and that’s a travesty, because Twitter is the cocktail party of the Internet—a place where listening well has tremendous benefits.

### SPIN YOUR STORY

- If Facebook’s main currency is friendship, Twitter’s is news and information. Breaking out on Twitter isn’t about breaking the news or spreading information—it’s about deejaying it. News has little value on its own, but the marketer who can skillfully spin, interpret, and remix it in his or her own signature style can often tell a story that is more powerful and memorable than the actual news itself.
- For example, if you’re a movie theater in Minneapolis, you could tweet “Just in—a great review of Bradley Cooper’s newest movie from the Star Tribune.” This is a common way to tweet—a little content, a link to a website, and you’re done.
- But what if you put a little more than the bare minimum of effort into that jab? What if instead of offering the boring facts, you offered something fresh? How much more interesting would it be if you tweeted “The Star Tribune has lost its mind. This movie stinks!” and then add the link.
-On Wine Library TV, I gave poor reviews to plenty of wines that were on sale in my store, and all it did was give people more reason to trust me. But if you were that worried about it, you could turn your negative review into a positive opportunity with a tweet like “The Star Tribune loves the new Bradley Cooper thriller. You’d then link to your blog, where you would not only have a copy of the review, but information on where and when your movie club meets every month.. You've now positioned yourself as the opinionated, provocative movie theater that offers a unique film-watching experience, and that’s a story that people will be interested in following.
- **Today, entertainment and escapism are prized above almost anything else. Consumers want infotainment, not information. Information is cheap and plentiful; information wrapped in a story, however, is special.**

### EXPAND YOUR UNIVERSE

- **Make a statement, stake out a position, establish a voice—this is how you successfully jab your Twitter followers. But what about all those people who have never heard of you? How are you jabbing them?**
- Other than the easy mobile experience it offers, Twitter stands in a class apart from other social media because of the open invitation it gives us to talk to the world at large.
- Twitter users, however, have an open-door policy (except for a very limited number of private profiles)—they use the platform knowing their tweets are public.
- People on Twitter are looking for attention; they welcome the spontaneous conversations that can ensue from a tweet. Strangers from around the world, many of whom will never meet in person, have been able to build robust online communities based on nothing more than a mutually shared interest in seahorses or wrestling.
- And people love how Twitter has allowed companies to enhance their customer service. If they want to get any brand’s attention, all they have to do is mention its name and they’ll get a response, because that brand is out there, using Twitter to help it communicate with its customers and build community.
- Many companies are still only half-heartedly paying attention to the online conversations people have about them, thus relinquishing control over how their brand is perceived and allowing the competition to step in and shape the conversation in its favor. Fortunately, there’s a book available that offers detailed explanations of why and how Twitter can be one of a business’s most powerful customer service tools. It’s my last book, The Thank You Economy. Read it, it’s good.
- All (half) kidding aside, Twitter is a marketer’s dream come true because it allows you to initiate a relationship with your customer. It’s still the only platform where you can jump into a conversation unannounced and no one thinks you’re a stalker. At any time, you can use the powerful Twitter search engine to find people who are talking about topics related to your business, even if only tangentially, and respond, adding your perspective and humor—and context—to the conversation.
- It wouldn’t take much imagination for an office furniture retailer to engage with people who mention the company name, or words like work, employee, employer, office, desk, Aeron, printer, scanner, and other office-related terms. Think of all the interesting ways it could engage with people with these words on their mind, however: deadline, backache, fluorescent, happy hour, raise, promotion, weekend, swivel, or clutter.
- Using Twitter Search this way helps you find storytelling opportunities with people who either already know about you, or who have expressed interest in topics related to your product or service.

### TRENDJACKING

- In this chatty, 24-7 online culture, there is no better resource than Twitter trends for creating the real-time context as well as the up-to-date content so imperative to staying relevant.
- Twitter’s trend-tracking ability is one of social media’s most powerful yet underused tools. You can set your account to track worldwide, national, or even regional trends. Learning to jab with trends gives you tremendous power.
- . Best of all, you can piggyback on other people’s content, giving you a reprieve from having to think up fresh creative day after day. You’ll still put out original content, but in this case, your content is the context you use to tell your story.
- It seemed to me that if consumers felt like talking about 30 Rock, marketers should be scrambling to tell their story within the context of 30 Rock, too.
- A look on the 7 For All Mankind (@7FAM) Twitter page the day after the end of 30 Rock revealed some light customer engagement—which is more than some companies manage, so kudos to them—a number of retweets sharing the nice things people have said about them or their clothing line—not so great, because that’s birdiebragging, and too many brands are doing it—and a stream of traditional right hooks, such as “Love a good leather tee,” with a link to their product page.
- More distressingly, they seem to be letting all of these opportunities go by. They didn't just opt not to ride 30 Rock; their Twitter stream revealed that they weren't riding any news or current events, except the ones they created themselves through sweepstakes, giveaways, and sales.
- 7 For All Mankind is a booming company that sells a great product or it wouldn't have the cult following it has garnered in the decade it’s been in business. And although its Twitter profile is lacking in cultural relevance, the brand does make a serious effort to engage with its followers and stay on top of the conversation around its product. But that’s Twitter 101, à la 2008.

### PROMOTED TWEETS

### USING TRENDS TO THROW RIGHT HOOKS

- Trending topics can be names or current events, but they can also be memes—words and phrases that have gone viral in the public sphere. These are low-hanging fruit, perfect storytelling fodder for any brand or business, especially local companies looking for a fun, creative way to differentiate themselves from their competitor.
- Taking advantage of hashtags is a great way for small businesses to get attention. That trending hashtag is getting clicked by tens of thousands of people. Once he’s there, he can see the whole story you’ve been telling about yourself with your steady stream of jabs and occasional right hooks. He decides to follow you. Maybe he needs a lawyer. Maybe he has reason to believe that one day he will need a lawyer. Regardless, you are now that much closer to gaining a new customer when the time is right.
- It could happen for a DJ in Miami named DJ Monte Carlo. While I was clicking on this trending hashtag, I spotted his tweet: “#SometimesYouHaveTo forgive those who hurt you but never forget what it taught you.”
- I liked that. It hit my emotional center. I decided to follow him, and he wound up in my Twitter stream, where my colleague Sam could see it. I’m not a big clubgoer, but Sam is. Maybe Sam decided to follow DJ Monte Carlo, too. And maybe, in six months, Sam will be scrolling through his Twitter feed and he’ll see Monte Carlo throw a right hook announcing that he’s spinning at a club in New York City that night. And maybe Sam will decide to go, too.
- Get it? This is not a far-fetched scenario; it’s how Twitter culture works every day. So get creative, have fun, and start experimenting with creating content on the spot, because the trending topics you see one minute will be gone the next. They have short life spans.
- The Twitter demographic skews hip and urban, but it doesn’t represent the only people talking online. Look for clues on Google trends. It skews young as well, just like all online data, but it reflects a broader population.
- It’s extremely hard to create a trending hashtag and bring people to you. It’s far better to listen, find out what’s trending, and bring yourself to the people.
- The link in the tweet doesn’t actually take consumers to make a purchase. It goes to KPMG’s Phil’s Blue Hat website, where it takes yet another click to buy the hat. Adding extra steps after a call to action wastes the consumer’s time.
- Whether you jab or right hook, marketing moves like that prove that you’re up to date, that you’ve got a sense of humor, and most of all, that you’re paying attention. You’d be amazed at how far that goes when customers are looking for someone with whom to do business.
- There’s a skill to choosing hashtags. You can’t just cover all your bases by tacking a bunch of hashtags onto a sentence. For example, Twitter is a hotbed of irony, but if your natural tone is generally serious and thoughtful, going ironic with your hashtags or suddenly adopting hipster vocabulary is just going to make you look like a poser.
- Being cool has nothing to do with age; it has to do with how solid your identity is. Do not pretend to be anyone other than who you are. That said, don’t take yourself too seriously, either. Be human.
- If you’re not comfortable talking pop culture, find someone in your organization or partner with an agency that is. Whatever you do, however, stay true to yourself. Do not pretend to be cooler than you are. Do not be the guy who hollered out, “Raise the roof!” a year too late. That’s how it sounds when you use hashtags and trending topics as indiscriminate marketing tactics, instead of incorporating select ones into your conversation. Listen. Entertain, through humor or provocation.
- Entrepreneurs and small businesses may see the amount of work that has to go into keeping up on Twitter and wonder if they shouldn’t just give up and go home.
- There’s no way they can compete with larger companies that have extensive budgets and staff. A person has to sleep sometime. Yes, creating real-time micro-content is an enormous job. Yes, start-ups and small businesses will have to be selective about which trends are worth their time and money. But putting your effort into that kind of thinking will do a heck of a lot more for your bottom line than sitting around like a dope waiting for customers to come to you. And it’s way better than tweeting content that no one sees or cares about.
- As a small business, you can gain an edge over larger companies when it comes to being nimble and authentic, two imperatives to successful Twitter marketing. Because you haven’t let your personality get squashed by a PR or legal department, you have more freedom to say what you think, to look for humor in unexpected places, and to be self-deprecating.
- People love it when you acknowledge your humanity and vulnerability. You may be a lightweight up against a heavyweight, but you can be the lightweight who wakes up at 3 A.M., drinks a few raw eggs, and puts in two hours at the gym before the competition’s alarm clock goes off. People will notice your effort, and it will make a difference.

### SCALING THE UNSCALABLE

- To his surprise, he received a reply from the verified Green Mountain Coffee Twitter account, saying, “We love that song! Isn’t it motivational?”
- On the surface, there is no connection between the topic of coffee and the bouncy love song Lentz was listening to. Green Mountain’s jab is pure storytelling context—we’re a brand that likes the same music you do. Now, what Lentz didn’t know was that Michael Franti was working on a fair trade campaign with Green Mountain Coffee, so there was, in fact, a reason why Green Mountain was so interested in engaging with his tweet. However, the fact that he wasn’t weirded out by the fact that a brand would contact him to talk about music proves how receptive people are to brands that reach out to consumers.
- Coffee was not mentioned until Lentz brought it up, politely telling Green Mountain that he was just learning to like coffee, so he had never tried their products, but that he would definitely do so now. Green Mountain made some inquiries into his coffee tastes and followed up with a few recommendations. The conversation ended with Green Mountain asking Lentz to DM his mailing address so they could send him a Michael Franti CD, just because.
- Lentz knew he was being marketed to, but he didn't care. Out of the blue, a brand had struck up an engaging conversation, given him some information he was looking for, and offered to send him a gift. Of course he wrote about it on his blog. Then he wrote about it again a few days later when he received the CD in the mail, as well as another package containing a handwritten thank-you note for writing about the company on his blog, a coffee mug, and a sample of coffee.

### COLOR COMMENTARY

- Treats the consumer like an idiot: In the text, Lacoste asks, “If you could do one thing today, what would it be?” That’s a great way to invite fans to engage.
  - In a parallel universe, fans are posting comments like “Sleep!” “Ride a paddle boat,” “Travel to Mars,” “Promote whirled peas,” and in all likelihood, “Shop!”—which would be an ideal moment for the brand to respond directly to that consumer and build a relationship.
  - It would be a great opportunity for the brand to show off the personality of its fans, which in turn should reflect favorably on its own persona. But in this universe, where someone at Lacoste isn’t thinking, the brand halts the conversation before it even starts by answering its own question. It’s as if Lacoste didn’t trust that its fans would answer the way it wanted them to. Remember, it’s "Give, give, ask", not "Give, give, demand!"
  - Pointless link: Like Zara on page 52, Lacoste seems to think that its website should be the hub of all its media outreach. If there’s anything that brands should take away from this book, it’s that there is no central hub anymore. When customers click on this Twitter link, they’re not taken to a special sale or even a promotion for the seasonal trends. They’re just taken straight to the general website, which at the time of this writing features a blank-faced preteen.

- DUNKIN’ DONUTS: Sweet, but Out of Date
  - This is a charming, lightweight jab to sell iced coffee. The copy is the appropriate length, the tone is right, and the image is clever.
  - Anachronistic image: They would have come across as a much more modern brand if they had depicted the cup with an iPhone charger coming out of it instead of a two-pronged plug that could belong to an elderly uncle’s bedside table lamp.
  - One more criticism: The tweet is signed “JG.” I understand that Dunkin’ Donuts is trying to humanize their brand, but in my opinion this is the wrong way to do it. You’re putting your business at risk when you let anyone except your logo or brand build equity on these public platforms. What happens when JG moves on to Starbucks or McDonald’s and people start asking, “Hey, where’s JG?”

- ADIDAS: Slam Dunk
  - This Adidas Originals right hook is tremendous (yeah, the shoes are kind of whack, but . . . ). I love where Adidas went with this for a few reasons.
  - Cool picture: They used a terrific picture of their product, clean but exploding with vibrant color.
  - Correct tone: The copy is strong and builds up the story. It’s written in the voice of the brand and target demo, even when they hit with the direct right hook, “Get ’em here.” Often brands will write their copy with all the right slang and swag for a strong delivery, but when they go for the formal ask, that right hook, they switch to more formal corporate-speak, “You can buy them here.” I love how Adidas carried the appropriate tone all the way through the right hook with “Get ’em here.” Then they got right to the point, linking straight to the product page, not their home page or some other secondary page that would have required more hunting and clicking.
  - You want to be gentle and subtle when you’re jabbing, but when it’s time to ask for business, go for it. Don’t be bashful. Own it. Good job, Adidas. Very, very, very well executed.

- HOLLISTER: Smart Strategy Gone Wrong
  - Brave creative: Hollister deserves credit for understanding the power of Internet memes to reach a young demographic. In response to the huge popularity of planking, owling—choosing a random location in which to perch like, you guessed it, an owl—Hollister decided to try to spawn a movement toward “guarding”—holding your hands up in front of your eyes like you’re holding binoculars. They went for a big right hook in asking their community to tag and engage with their meme.
  - It’s a bold move, and I love it! The problem is, though, that it’s ridiculously hard for a brand to create a meme. It’s not a particularly practical move, and consumers don’t tend to follow it.** In general, brands should be following memes, not creating them. But Hollister tried, which is admirable.**
  - Clumsy hashtag: Where they really went wrong is in choosing their hashtag. At the time that I first reviewed this tweet, a click on #guarding showed that security guards use it, and so do sixteen-year-old basketball players. Hollister doesn’t own the “guarding” concept, and so they should have chosen a more distinct hashtag to bring attention to the meme.
  - Busy visuals: Then there’s the photo they used. It’s colorful, but small and cluttered. There are too many things vying for your eye and the text is cramped. Hollister’s story could have been told through a tweet in a shorter, more streamlined way with a single up-close picture of a pair of pretty boys’ faces with the hashtag beneath.

- SURF TACOS: Feeding New Platforms
  - Good cross-pollination: Surf Taco has a respectable following on Twitter of about 6,400 followers. They have about 500 on Instagram. By pushing an Instagram picture on Twitter, they’re wisely using their bigger pool of followers to increase the size of their smaller one. This is a strategy more people need to follow, although pushing Instagram to Twitter worked better before competition between the two meant that Twitter cut off seamless Instagram integration, so that it would no longer load natively. However, when you are trying to develop a following on a new platform, whether it’s Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, or whatever we’ll see in the future, it’s important to use the platform where you have the most data to drive traffic to the new one (three years ago I was telling people to use their email service to drive traffic to Facebook). Siphoning data from place to place is an excellent strategic move to build awareness of your presence on a new platform.
  - Appropriate aesthetic: Surf Taco also clearly understands the aesthetic of Instagram. This isn’t a particularly artistic or exciting shot, but at least they’re not using a stock photo or a glossy product picture. It’s a casual, natural scene from a real place, and based on the solid engagement it received, even from a relatively small community, it resonated with followers.
  - They also knew enough about Twitter users to include a hashtag, and a good one, too, though it might have been smart to include one or two broad hashtags, like “#baseball,” to try to earn even greater visibility.

- CHUBBIES SHORTS: It’s All About the Voice
   - Ultimately, success in social media boils down to three things: understanding the nuances of your platform, using a distinct voice, and driving your business goals. Chubbies does all three in this, one of my favorite pieces of micro-content in this book.
   - "A cat named Pablo Picatso > cargos (cargo shorts)".
  - The most powerful thing about this piece is the voice, which carries through this content from beginning to end. It’s young, wry, irreverent, and entertaining—exactly what the demo is looking for when it comes to Twitter. The tweet itself shows that the brand understands the nuances of this platform. It is brief and spare, nothing but two hashtags that link to a meme that offers humorous suggestions of things that are superior, in this case a cat named Pablo Picatso, to their competitor’s product, cargo shorts.
  - It’s a ridiculous and funny comparison. Now, why did this meme work, when Hollister couldn’t get much traction with #guarding? The hashtag. No one but Chubbies has any reason to create hashtags like #CargoEmbargo or #SOTO—Skies Out Thighs Out—so they have complete ownership. The hashtags are distinct enough to gain cachet to those people who decide to run with them. Chubbies didn’t blow it by linking out to a product page, either.
  - You want to see ROI on social media? Tell a story that’s good enough to get people to buy stuff. My creative team and I were impressed with this brand’s commitment to upholding a strong voice and its attention to the nuances of the platform. That raised our brand awareness, which got us talking about the shorts, which made us a little obsessed, which led me to buying eleven pairs, one for each member of the team. The VaynerMedia team’s thighs will be out in Chubbies style.

- BULGARI US: A PR Company Gets in Its Own Way
  - Live tweeting events can get obnoxious when the only value the tweets bring are to the PR company trying to get impressions. The picture is so weak, an intern hiding behind a potted plant could have taken it. We could have chosen to criticize any of the twenty-three tweets they put out throughout the day but this one deserves special attention for being particularly terrible.
  - I do give Bulgari credit for mentioning the catering company. It shows heart for an international brand to publicly acknowledge a company with a 200-person Twitter following.

- NETFLIX: Simplicity Works
  - The picture is a clear reference to the show’s season-three finale, when a character quits the family company. And the copy is timely and clever. “Hey Brother,” a line frequently heard on the show, gave Netflix the perfect way to ride the hashtag wave of National Sibling Day. For the record, almost every day of the year has been designated an unofficial national day of something-or-other—use this knowledge well.

- AMC: Calls to Nowhere
  - This tweet feels schizophrenic—“Retweet if you love The Rock!NO!Watch this video!NO!Buy tickets!” In 140 characters, AMC managed to make three calls to action. That’s an accomplishment, but not one to be proud of.
  - When you’re asking for three calls to action, you’re asking for no calls to action. The customer spotting this mishmash of links and short text coming through a mobile screen had to have been extremely confused. There’s just no way to know where to focus our attention first. AMC often makes some strong social media moves, but unfortunately, much like the GI Joe movies, this one sucked.

- NBA: Smart Partnering
   - Every decision shows finesse, from keeping the tweet streamlined and clear, to capitalizing the word “you” to help connect with their community. They repeatedly reinforced the Kia brand, beginning with the inclusion of the Kia Twitter handle in the tweet, to framing the NBA.com landing page—which opens with an article and photo announcing LeBron James as the winner of the MVP Kia Awards—in bold red with the Kia logo. I don’t know for sure that Kia paid the NBA for this fully integrated social media drive, but if they did, it was money well spent.

- GOLF PIGEON: Confusing Quantity with Quality
  - If you’re just starting out or you have a small consumer base and you want to trendjack to amplify your reach, one strategic and valuable way to do it is to use Twitter’s ad platform and buy a keyword that will turn your tweet into the first or second result when a consumer searches a term on Twitter.
  - But one thing I’m always stressing is that it’s not the quantity of impressions that counts, it is the quality. You can tweet out to a million people, but if your tweet stinks or is irrelevant to them, it’s entirely possible that of that million people who saw your tweet, a half million of them now hate your product or your brand.
  - The day this tweet went out, Lionel Messi, the best soccer player in the world, must have scored his seven thousandth spectacular goal of the season, and his name was trending. Golf Pigeon must have thought that if soccer fans were talking about Messi, they might like to talk about golf, too. Wait, that doesn’t even make sense.
  - One explanation for this strange pairing might be that sometimes Twitter pushes promoted tweets into related hashtags to deliver more impressions. Golf Pigeon might not have chosen to promote against #messi, in which case they’re off the hook.

- HOLIDAY INN: A One-Way Conversation
 - Retweeting nice things said about you to your entire consumer base has only one name. It’s called bragging. From April 21 to April 23, 2013, Holiday Inn spent most of its time retweeting the nice things people said about them to all thirty thousand of their fans, when instead they should have spent five minutes forming a deeper relationship with the fans who took the time to praise them. By the way, any time a brand of this size is following more people than follow it back, it speaks to just how severely they are misusing their Twitter account. It’s a sign that they’re gaming the system—following people in hopes that they will follow back. It’s a cheap tactic.
  - Poor Holiday Inn is taking the heat in this book, but retweeting fan praise is a mistake that thousands of brands make every day, probably because PR companies love to tell their clients that it’s a smart move. I’m telling you, it isn’t. **Retweets of this nature have little to no value to anyone who follows you. It’s truly poor form, not to mention incredibly boring for your followers.**

- FIFA: Breaking News
  - As I’ve said, businesses that want to compete in social media today need to embrace a dual identity. They will of course be the purveyors of a product or service, but they must also learn to act like a media company. This post illustrates exactly what that looks like. EA Sports FIFA is a video game for soccer lovers. But with this post, the brand shows that it understands that if it is to compete, it must become much more.
  - The tweet went out to announce that the teams for the UEFA Champions League semifinals had just been confirmed. But on this day, a video game broke the news, if not to the world, then at least to anyone who followed it on Twitter. What did this jab do for the brand? The number of retweets was more than five hundred.
  - Anyone who got their news here first turned right around and retweeted it to all of their followers. All those fans and their followers gave EA Sports FIFA the news credit. In addition, the brand reaped the rewards of nice levels of engagement, brand awareness, brand affinity, and probably tens if not hundreds of new followers—all by leading the media conversation around their genre. Those new followers represent many people who might be receptive when EA Sports FIFA throws a right hook in the form of an offer, coupon, or other call to action.

- TACO BELL: Getting It
  - `"#thoughtsinbed Taco Bell, I need you."`
  - This one is impressive, a truly awesome example of skillful trendjacking. `#ThoughtsInBed` was trending. Taco Bell jumped in and offered their answer in their typical snarky, cheeky, edgy voice. Obviously their efforts resonated, because out of only about 430,000 followers, they received almost 13,000 retweets.
  - Because Taco Bell did exactly what they were supposed to do—they respected the platform, and they talked in the same voice as their consumer. They understand that the Twitter demo is a youth demo, and if you look at their stream, you can see that day in, day out, they’re reaching out to their followers and consistently making contact, building enormous brand affinity in the process. They deserve the highest level of praise I can offer: They get it.

- SKITTLES: Hashtag Heaven
  - `"If you want to hide something, just put it next to a pack of Skittles. Nobody will even notice it's there." #protip`
  - A lot of examples in this book make me want to cry, but this one made me smile. It probably made you smile, too. It’s cute, it’s funny, it sounds like a Skittles lover. The really smart thing they did, though, was to link their micro-content to an evergreen hashtag. It’s a hashtag that never dies, its jokey, effervescent content ensuring that it remains relevant to anyone looking for a little humor. If Skittles keeps tweeting out micro-content like this, it has a long, exciting social media life ahead of it.

- CHRIS GETHARD: Hard Work That Will Pay Off
  - `"Welcome to the cult, homeboy."`
  - Comedians are an interesting demo on Twitter because an ungodly number of them use it to preview jokes, spread awareness, and throw right hooks like asking people to buy their DVD or come to a show. This upcoming comedian out of Brooklyn, however, has hit on the right formula. He tells jokes, of course, but he also retweets and engages, responding to and talking to fans and letting them know that he’s paying attention and appreciating the time they take to let him know what they think. He’s putting in a ton of effort that will result in big residual gains once he has a special or he decides to start throwing more right hooks.

- TWITTER: Clueless
  - Twitter helped my career in a huge way, so it’s with a heavy heart that I have to criticize them for their stunning lack of engagement.
  - They are in a constant state of push, putting out self-serving announcement after announcement, and make zero effort to build community.
  - That the platform itself has no idea how to natively storytell proves that we are still living in the early days of the grand social media timeline.
  - Twitter has the capability to listen to people talk all day long. When it first bought Vine and millions of people were tweeting raves about the new product, why couldn’t it even muster up the occasional “Thank you”? How could the marketing team not realize the importance of establishing an emotional connection with its users?
  - If they had, maybe some of the people who flocked to Instagram after it launched video sharing might have stayed loyal to Vine, instead of sending it into a downward spiral. The world is emotional. If Twitter itself is not listening and reaching out on Twitter, how can they expect anyone to feel strongly about the platform? I have a lot of friends at Twitter and I’m curious to hear their opinions when they read this critique. I’m sure they’ll have plenty to say.

- SPHERO: Nerding It Up
  - I love this in a big way. It’s a perfect example of a brand that understands its audience and how to tell its story. They understand exactly who would buy a ball controlled by an iPhone. They used a video from a BuzzFeed link, which shows they speak their demo’s native tongue. They get the audience, the medium, the language, the story. Even someone who didn’t belong to the targeted demo would think this is cool.
   -Many start-ups struggle to tell good stories because instead of building community, they’re focusing on fund-raising and getting an article about themselves published in TechCrunch. It’s hard for a new business to strike the right balance among so many competing priorities. Sphero deserves kudos for managing to do it when so many others put it off. Truly, this is a perfect execution.

- FLEURTY GIRL: Flirting with Brilliance
  - Fleurty Girl has five stores, but that’s still small, and the owner’s commitment to her community, both online and in-store, is impressive.
  - Born and bred in New Orleans, owner Lauren Thom throws around acronyms like NOLA; she knows about the peach festival in Ruston; she retweeted to a New Orleans Saints player—she’s speaking the native language. She probably hasn’t built up a huge base yet, but she’s working hard toward it.
  - There are ways she could add a little more spice and flair to her tweets to increase her retweet value. She could add hashtags, for example, to ignite emotions or laughs. When she tweeted, “I love peaches,” an appropriate hashtag might have been #peachesfillthebelly.
  - You need to do anything you can to get people to smile and burn a slightly deeper impression in your consumer’s mind. Instead of wishing Darren Sproles a happy birthday, she could have looked up his age and matched it to the Saints player who wore that number during the 2012 season, so that the greeting becomes something a little more memorable, such as “Happy Ryan Steed!” Something like that would have been fun. I think she’ll get there.

- SHAKESPEARE’S PIZZA: Delicious Local Flavor
  - `"Weekend lost and found: 1 flower vase, 1 temporary tattoo, 4 baseball caps."`
  - `"Congratulations graduates! Don't forget that pizza was ranked #1 in celebratory foods based on a survey that we made up just now!"`
  - `"If you're downtown for the Earth Day celebration today, don't forget to pick up a pizza on your way home."`
  - I’m happy to praise yet another small business that has made a strong commitment to putting out good micro-content, and has a talented writer creating their copy, too.
  - Pay attention—the third tweet seems like a simple response to Earth Day, but look at the clever hashtag. That hashtag shows that this company gets the psyche of a Twitter user, that it understands that it’s those little moments that make consumers go “Ha!” that compel them to retweet to friends and put your brand in their feeds. Shakespeare’s Pizza could have paid for a banner ad to get an impression, but no one would have cared.

- Questions to Ask About Your Twitter Content:
  - Is it to the point?
  - Is the hashtag unique and memorable?
  - Is the image attached high quality?
  - Does the voice sound authentic? Will it resonate with the Twitter audience?

## ROUND 5: GLAM IT UP on PINTEREST

- Unless you sell a product that no woman in a million years would want for herself or any person in her life—and that’s a pretty limited list of products—or your legal department is dragging its feet, you’re a dope if your brand is not on Pinterest.
- And even if you firmly believe that you can’t sell to the female demographic that outnumbers male Pinterest users by about five to one, you’d be wise to continue reading this chapter.
- Pinterest was invented to help people create online collections of things that they love and that inspire them.
- It immediately took off as a fantasyland for food porn addicts, fashion lovers, and people seeking home renovation and décor ideas. Then its scope quickly ballooned to reflect the myriad interests and hobbies of the approximately 48 million people currently using the site.
- That represents 16 percent of U.S. Internet users, only 1 percent fewer than Twitter.
- Now that Pinterest has revised its terms of use, has introduced business accounts, and has planned rollouts for business-friendly features, more brands are comfortable including Pinterest in their social media portfolio. Make whatever promises you must to your legal team so they can sleep at night, but afterward do not waste one more minute before creating an account so you can get your story out to the millions of people eagerly scouring the site for something new and inspiring.

### PINTEREST PSYCHOLOGY 101

- Pinterest also appeals to the same urge that compels teenagers to decorate their lockers with pictures of their favorite bands, office workers to liven up their workspace with bobbleheads and photos of their motorcycle trip through Argentina, home owners to place art in the middle of a window facing the street, or drivers to slap bumper stickers on their cars.
- We love displays and symbols and stuff that quickly and silently tells the world who we are.
- **Better yet, we love visual reminders of who we want to be.** Aspiration and acquisition are two of the most powerful human drivers that lead people to buy, and Pinterest can satisfy both.
- ***The numbers prove that the platform has become where people go to fulfill their material and emotional wish lists. A survey by Steelhouse shows that Pinterest users are 79 percent more likely to purchase something they spot on Pinterest than on Facebook. Pinterest produces four times the revenue-per-click of Twitter. Some small businesses that experimented early on with Pinterest saw as much as a 60 percent increase in revenue. Between 2011 and 2012, Pinterest’s share of social-media-driven revenue for e-retailers soared from 1 percent to 17 percent.***
- What’s supremely fun and unique about Pinterest is that people can follow your boards, not just you the brand, which means that even if your product has some inherent limitations on Pinterest, you can still explore aspects of your brand that in other formats you might keep under wraps for fear of confusing your brand message. Pinterest gives you the freedom to set your brand’s personality free.

### TO BEGIN, LEARN THE ART OF THE PIN

- Pinterest is eye candy, so every pin must be visually compelling. Think of your content as a collector’s item. Your images need to invite clicks, and drab, boring pictures aren’t going to do it. No clicks, no chance of users coming to your page, absorbing your story, and making their way into your world. Keep this in mind whether you’re creating your own content or repinning content from other people’s boards.
- Pinterest users organize their Internet finds into categories, or boards, and businesses can arrange their content in the same way.
- So if you’re a local tea shop, you could pin images under boards labeled Green Tea, Black Tea, Teas from India, Teas from China, and all the other types of tea you want to sell. You could pin images accordingly, including a price, because doing so increases the number of likes your pin receives by 36 percent, thus increasing your chances of making a sale. All pins would link back to their original source, in this case your website, so that with one click on the image your viewer can convert to a customer. It’s that easy.
- Yet few consumers start out their Pinterest perusals by going directly to a brand’s page; they usually get there by following the images they see being repinned by others. Yet there is nothing exciting about a description like “Green Tea,” and it’s only a supremely dedicated green tea lover who is going to be moved to repin that corresponding image or follow that board.
- If anyone else does, it will probably be because you pinned a jab—something that caught a consumer’s eye and compelled her to take a closer look at your page.
- Something like a pin with the caption “Tea You Drink After a Bad Date,” or “Tea for Handling the In-Laws,” or “Tea to Celebrate Summer Break.”
- Now you’ve created context, proving that you sympathize with your user’s experience and that your brand has a place in her life. That’s the kind of brand-to-consumer jabbing that motivates people to repin on their own boards, which exponentially increases the number of people exposed to your brand, which leads to more impressions, and more clicks to find out where the content originated, and so on and so forth down that social media rabbit hole until they land on your website, where you are perfectly positioned to make the sale with a solid right hook.

### JAB TO CREATE SERENDIPITY

- Many brands and businesses focus exclusively on pinning their original content, but as with Twitter, there is tremendous value in putting your own spin on the content that others bring to the platform. You may not be making direct sales, but you’re offering value to consumers by becoming someone they can trust, thus increasing their incentive to come to you if they do decide they need your product or service.
- These kind of deejayed repins are the kind you want to tweet out, too. Naturally, any tweet would have the potential to bring Twitter followers to your Pinterest page, but as always, any time you invite debate and discussion or introduce elements of fun and surprise to content, you increase your likelihood of not just making a connection, but building a relationship that leads to a sale.
- An effective way to attract more followers is to create boards that are only tangentially related to your brand.
- If all of your pins are about tea, you’re only going to reach a certain demographic interested in tea.
- And if you did it authentically, you could even successfully create community with boards that are completely unrelated to your brand. This is where Pinterest really gives small businesses and entrepreneurs the advantage over larger organizations, because their legal and PR departments haven’t smothered their personality. You can create pins about the city where you live; pins about music, books, and movies; pins about pets; pins about causes that your company supports. It’s a fantastic way to tell your unabridged story, and you don’t even have to say a word.
- If you jab with that kind of color and creativity, people will be far more likely to pay attention to your right hooks. Among the practical lists of green, black, and pu-erh teas, and the subtle lists like Teas to Drink After a Bad Date and Teas for Sunday Mornings, you should include one aggressive sales pitch: Teas We Recommend This Month. If you’ve thrown enough compelling jabs, no one will find it off-putting to come face-to-face with the occasional right hook. If anything, they’ll be glad you made it so easy for them to try your product.

### USE JABS TO BUILD COMMUNITY

- Comments are an up-and-coming aspect of Pinterest, yet they are an excellent way to instigate discovery. If you’re on Twitter, you know how this works.
- Find opportunities to talk to people with interests that align with yours. Be genuinely interested in other people’s pins and find ways to add context through conversation. By engaging with other Pinterest users, you create reasons for them to click on your name to learn more about you.
- Your descriptions, too, can create opportunities for other people to comment. A pin with a provocative title like “Tea You Drink After a Bad Date” is highly likely to attract someone who will comment something along the lines of “Hope I don’t need this tonight,” or “Where was this when I needed it last week?” And there it is—the perfect opening to build a relationship, expand your community, and offer people something of value, if only in the form of a new, fun way to complain about the sorry state of the dating pool.
- In addition, the comments give brands the chance to add their perspective to other people’s pins. If the teakettle manufacturer notices that a tea vendor has questioned the design of one of its products, it should reply immediately, either explaining that the vendor is obviously misusing the kettle, or admitting the mistake and assuring the world that it is taking steps to fix the problem.

### FOLLOW THE RULES

- Pinterest puts a lot of energy into encouraging proper etiquette on the site, but if you think about it, the rules on Pinterest don’t differ much from the rules in the real world.
- If you’re in business, first and foremost, you have to be nice. Show your customers that you care. Exhibit your wares in an attractive and evocative way.
- Be generous with your knowledge. Be truthful.
- If you can’t provide what someone is looking for, make sure to help her find someone who can. Use every customer point of contact to weave stories about who you are and what your brand stands for.
- Then, and only then, throw that right hook with everything you’ve got.

- Questions to Ask About Your Pinterest Content
  - Does my picture feed the consumer dream?
  - Did I give my boards clever, creative titles?
  - Have I included a price when appropriate?
  - Does every photo include a hyperlink?
  - Could this pin double as an ad or act as an accompanying photo to an article featured in a top-flight magazine?
  - Is this image easily categorized so people don’t have to think too hard about where to repin it on their boards?

## ROUND 6: CREATE ART on INSTAGRAM

- Instagram is another visual-centric social network. Like Pinterest, it has what I like to call “baked-in utility,” meaning that it’s really good at what it’s supposed to do, which is help you take better mobile photographs. Yet it is a vastly more challenging platform for marketers.
- Unlike Pinterest, where repinning is encouraged, users can only share their own Instagram photos. And whereas on Pinterest you can embed a hyperlink into your photo that with one click will direct users to your product or service page, Instagram is a closed loop. Anyone who clicks on your Instagram photo gets brought back to Instagram. Smart move for Instagram, not so good for marketers interested in sending traffic to a specific online location.
- Given the app’s limitations as a business tool, why should brands scramble to start posting photos? For the same reasons they might post ads in Fine Cooking, Vogue, People, or even Traveler of Charleston magazine. After all, if you take out the editorial content in between the ads, a print magazine is, in essence, a small-format gallery of beautiful, provocative, or tantalizing images. It’s a consumption platform, and that’s all Instagram is, too.
- It’s a slightly more interactive experience than a print magazine, because users can like an image and offer comments. There’s also an element of shareability and distribution in that you can connect your account to Facebook and Twitter, thus increasing awareness around your product and promoting word of mouth.
- But really, when you load photos on the service, you’re putting out content that no one can immediately do anything with, just like when you place ads in magazines. And you’re doing it for the same reason: scale.
- You advertise in magazines because you know you can reach a dedicated audience, measurable by subscription rates. Instagram has incredible scale, 100 million monthly active users as of the writing of this book. **If it’s worth it to your brand to pay tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to place beautiful content in magazines, don’t you think it’s worth putting similar content on Instagram for free?**
- It's that scale at low cost that makes up for Instagram’s lack of social value. The app’s rapid growth rate proves that people are increasingly drawn to mobile, image-based content. As always, where consumers go, so should marketers. ***Consider Instagram as one of the great jabbing platforms, there to set the tone, tell your story, reinforce your brand, and build impressions.***
- Not that it’s impossible to throw Instagram right hooks. Let’s remember that there was no retweet option in the original incarnation of Twitter. People are taking screenshots of photos they like on Instagram and reposting them, or using newly developed apps to the same end. There’s always a work-around if you want one. You can’t embed a hyperlink into your picture, but there’s no reason why you can’t insert a URL into your description. People aren’t dumb; they’ll know what to do.

### A FEW TIPS TO CREATING SUCCESSFUL INSTAGRAM CONTENT

- Make it “Instagram.” People love Instagram because of the quality of the content that has up until now been made available there. Use your content to express yourself authentically, not commercially.
- Reach the Instagram generation: Learn to make Instagram work for you—it will be your gateway to the next generation of social users.
- The kids will be on Instagram (they’re already there); their parents will still be on Facebook. They did, in the spring of 2012, for a billion dollars in cash and stock. I justified the buy on Piers Morgan the next day, explaining that if you looked at the evolution of content from Flickr, to Myspace, to Facebook, Tumblr, and Pinterest, it was clear that pictures were gaining in importance and were going to rule the social media world.
- When Instagram started building massive momentum in 2011, there was no way that Facebook could ignore it. Despite everything Facebook had—News Feed, pages, ads—this service built on mobile and pictures posed a real threat to a company that wanted to be the best photo-sharing service around. In fact, it posed the only threat Facebook has ever faced. They had to buy it. I said that I thought the billion dollars Facebook paid was a steal, and I was ridiculed. But go figure—no one is laughing now.
- **Go crazy with your hashtags: Hashtags matter here, maybe even more than they do on Twitter. On Instagram, hashtags are the whole darn cupcake.** You can’t overuse them. Putting out five, six, or even ten hashtags in a row per post isn’t a bad way to communicate. And if you don’t want hashtags to clutter your post copy, no problem. Put your hashtags in a comment on your photo and it accomplishes the same thing. One click on a hashtag brings a user to a whole page of other images with the same hashtag. There is no better way to earn more impressions and gain followers. **Hashtags are the doorways through which people will discover your brand; without them, you’re doomed to invisibility.**
- Become Explore-worthy: The most gorgeous, evocative content on Instagram gets streamed into something called the Explore page, which exposes your content to all of Instagram, not just users who have chosen to follow you. Instagram swears that the number of likes that content receives isn’t the only deciding factor as to what makes it into the Explore tab, but it’s surely an important one. It’s a phenomenal way to build impressions. Most small businesses and even Fortune 500 brands will most likely never find themselves in this exclusive club, but any celebrities reading this book should take note of the huge opportunity.

- Questions to Ask About Your Instagram Content
  - Is my image artsy and indie enough for the Instagram crowd?
  - Have I included enough descriptive hashtags?
  - Are my stories appealing to the young generation?

### ROUND 7: GET ANIMATED on TUMBLR

- Tumblr isn’t for everyone. It skews young, appealing largely to eighteen- to thirty-four-year-olds with a slight tilt toward women. In addition, it skews extremely artsy, providing an exhibition space for photographers, musicians, and graphic designers. If Twitter is hip-hop, Tumblr is indie rock. And yet, though Tumblr doesn’t have the scale of Pinterest or Instagram, you should be there.
- I have a soft spot for this platform, and even invested in it in 2009. I became a huge fan during the early days of my career, both because it was so easy to use and because its minimalist format invited less text-heavy, more visually oriented posts. In fact, Tumblr’s young founder, twenty-six-year-old David Karp, created Tumblr because though he wanted to blog, he found the “big empty text box” of traditional blogging platforms too daunting. His problem was the same as mine: He had tons of ideas to share, but he hated to write. Tumblr’s obstsalat (German for “fruit salad”) format became a perfect platform for the random bits and pieces of content that started getting tossed around as users scrolled through the site.
- Most people continue to think of Tumblr as a mere blogging platform, but in the few short years since its launch in 2007, it has become much more. In January 2012, it debuted a newly streamlined dashboard that suggested an attempt to Twitterfy itself and embrace its evolution as a full-fledged social media site. And in a Forbes interview that same month, Karp referred to it as a “media network.” So what is it? It’s all of those things, but to get the most out of it, brands should approach it as a brandable, unique, micro-content exhibition space and sparring ring.
- Unlike Facebook and Twitter, which guide social connections through who you know—the social graph—Tumblr was the original interest graph platform, meaning connections are made based on what people are interested in. Produce the right eye candy for your audience, and they will find you. And on Tumblr, there is a particularly tasty bit of candy at your disposal that you can’t post on any other social network: the animated GIF.
- Animated GIFs are becoming a whole new cultural movement and vehicle for self-expression, and the best place to find them is on Tumblr. People are creating amazing art with the form, transforming ordinary images into magical mini-worlds. A picture of a fish is beautiful; a picture of a fish whose mouth is open and closing is surprising, funny, dramatic, and kinetic. You can use an animated GIF for your Twitter profile picture, but in general, aside from Google+, there is no social media site that allows you to take advantage of this gorgeous, powerful storytelling format the way Tumblr does.
- Does it matter that much, especially when the scale of viewers is so much less here than on other image-heavy sites like Pinterest and Instagram? An unscientific comparison of still images to animated GIFs on Tumblr often reveals that people are driven to engage with moving pictures far more than they are with static ones.
- Many times, a gorgeous photo will get three times fewer hearts, or likes, than the relatively dull image right next to it, simply because the dull image is also an animated GIF. Animated GIFs are still so new that they offer an element of surprise and wonder. What’s a marketer’s job if not to treat your customers to surprise and wonder?
- Tumblr has always been more of a publishing platform than a consumption platform, but people do consume there, just at an incredibly rapid rate. That’s why it’s perfect for mobile: because users can just scroll and scroll and scroll and feed themselves with an endless stream of beautiful, even haunting images.
- The jabbing possibilities should be obvious. Tell your story and create brand impressions through amazing art that highlights what makes your brand special. Tumblr is arty, and so is its audience. This isn’t crafty, scrapbooking Middle America; this is urban loft, bike-riding, ironic eyewear America.
- Study the platform, figure out what people are looking for, and give it to them in the platform’s native tongue, preferably in GIF form. That’s your surest way of getting people to slow their speed-scroll down to a crawl, and maybe even stop to vote their approval by liking it with the little heart button or commenting with a note. Don’t be afraid to deejay other people’s content by adding your own copy and posting it to your blog, either. The easy shareability of content makes community building a cinch here. Make sure to add plenty of detailed tags to make it easy for people looking for content like yours to find.
- While Tumblr is overwhelmingly a platform ripe for jabs, right hooks are possible. Just keep them very, very quiet. Every now and then, add a link to the bottom of your content that directs users to your Web page or retail site. If your content is as good as it should be, people will be thrilled to see that they can purchase your cool product or service. In addition, as with all platforms, keep an eye out for future opportunities to convert the sale. Even if you don’t feel like Tumblr is an optimal site for you, it’s better to get there early and get comfortable so that by the time your competitors recognize that they’ve been missing out on an opportunity, you’ve cornered the market.
- I believe all of these tips will remain relevant even though as I was putting the finishing touches on this chapter, Yahoo bought the company for $1.1 billion. My opinion may be a little skewed since I am fortunate enough to be an investor in Tumblr, but I don’t think this purchase will result in a lot of changes to the platform. Yahoo will probably take a hands-off approach and simply let David Karp’s genius run unfettered. It’s likely that we will see a little more aggressive advertising on the platform, but if Yahoo has any sense, it will navigate this acquisition in the same way as Facebook did when it bought Instagram—it will leave it alone.

- Questions to Ask About Your Tumblr Content
  - Did I customize my theme in a way that properly reflects my brand?
  - Did I make a cool animated GIF?

## ROUND 8: OPPORTUNITIES in EMERGING NETWORKS

- Snapchat
  - Many people would be surprised to discover that it’s actually used much more for circulating visual gags and jokes than dirty pictures.
  - Snapchat was made for a world that can’t stand one minute of boredom, and that is fast becoming addicted to putting out content.
  - I share, therefore I am. Whereas before, the Internet operated under the 90-9-1 rule—the principle that generally, 90 percent of Internet users consume content, 9 percent edit it, and merely 1 percent create it—apps like Snapchat are going to shift those ratios to reflect something more along the lines of a 75-20-5 rule.
  - Snapchat is not for profound content, nor to produce anything that’s going to be treasured for eternity, or even analyzed as a case study one day. It’s where people will go for a quick laugh before moving on. Imagine the power of a brand or business that can jab well enough to become the source of choice for those little moments that get us through our day. It’s also a place where your content is likely to get more focused attention than on any other platform, because knowing that your content will disappear in seconds is incentive enough for consumers to make sure they don’t miss it.
  - As usual, this new platform has been derided for its low value. It’s not useful. No one will use it for anything important. It has no value. We’ve heard it all before. The debate swirling around the actual value of Snapchat is the same debate that was swirling around Facebook and Twitter not so long ago. Yet someone is clearly finding value in the platform when more than 60 million images are being sent around on a daily basis. And that value is only going to grow as the platform matures.

## ROUND 9:EFFORT

- Content is king, context is God, and then there’s effort. Together, they are the holy trinity for winning on Facebook, Twitter, and any other platform, and even for winning in any business.
- Effort is the great equalizer. It doesn’t matter if your competitor is three times bigger than you and built like a Mack truck, or if it has a marketing budget that matches the GDP of a medium-size country, or if it has a staff of hundreds and you are alone in your broom closet with two laptops, an iPad, and a cell phone. What matters is the effort you put into your work. And never has effort counted more than it does today.
- Social media gave access to the market and even an edge over corporate behemoths to creative, determined, nimble upstarts. But now that big business has finally started investing in social media platforms like Facebook, albeit hesitantly, entrepreneurs no longer have as strong an advantage as they once did. One or two people just can’t be in as many places at once building community as a staff of twenty. What they can still do, however, is win through effort. Budgets should have no effect on the amount of effort, heart, and sincerity that can go into your conversations with your customers. You can’t be everywhere at once, but when the quality of your communication and community-building efforts is better than anyone else’s, it doesn’t really matter.
- If you throw a great jab or right hook on Facebook, people will start to comment. Marketers that creatively and sincerely engage in as many of those resulting conversations as possible will be able to scale their relationships higher than their opponent. You should make sure to tag the person you want to talk to, to guarantee they see you have replied, and to bring them back to your page to continue the dialogue. Maybe you see that some people are unclear about the hours of your Black Friday sale, or they’re not sure that the sale is happening in all your store locations. By going back and clearing up the confusion, you’re amplifying your right hook and solidifying your relationship with your customers.
- It’s true that brands that throw out consistently skillful storytelling jabs and right hooks can eventually build up so much brand equity that they don’t need to engage with quite the same frenzy as a newcomer, or a brand working to repair its reputation, but it’s all relative. Twenty percent less of massive amounts of engagements is usually still more than most marketers’ average engagement levels. But you cannot get lazy and rest on your laurels. You’ve got to keep putting in the effort, or you’ll get knocked out in ten minutes.

## ROUND 10: ALL COMPANIES ARE MEDIA COMPANIES

- I’ve just spent nine chapters emphasizing that the key to social marketing is micro-content. In fact, the shorter your content and storytelling, the better. But as I look to the future, I see a yin to the micro-content yang.
- But as brands continue to push the traditional boundaries via which they used to disseminate their content, and as companies recognize that they less and less often have to rent their media, but can own it and remarket it whenever they want, they’re going to start wondering why they have to deal with separate media companies at all?
- There is no logical reason to think that a tire company should be a food critic, but a hundred years ago, Michelin tires started reviewing rural restaurants to encourage people living in the cities to drive farther and wear their tires out more quickly.
- Guinness created the Guinness Book of World Records to reinforce its brand and give people something to talk about in the pubs. Similarly, I predict that one day a brand like Nike could put out its own sports programming and compete successfully against ESPN, or Amtrak could launch a publication that could stand up to Travel + Leisure. The start-up costs would be extremely low for a luxury brand like Burberry to publish an alternative to the Robb Report, or for Williams-Sonoma to publish its own version of Eater or Thrillist.
- So long as brands remain transparent, so that their consumers aren’t duped into thinking these sites and publications are strictly objective content providers, this could be a fruitful way to expand their brand and their content reach. In a way, it would be no different from what I was doing through Wine Library TV. Everyone knew that I sold wine, but they trusted my product reviews because I made a huge effort to be honest, fair, and authentic. Any other brand could do the same for the product or service they sell.
- In the marketing world, there will soon be no more separation between church and state. It’s going to be exciting to witness the innovation that comes about as brands become major players in the media world.

## ROUND 11: CONCLUSION

- It takes a ton of effort to figure out how to use any social media platform to its full potential, and today we’ve got seven major ones to contend with.
- It always is. A member of the Google Analytics team recently informed me that almost no one uses the tracking system properly. Google Analytics has been around for eight years already, more than long enough for marketing departments to know it inside and out. But people’s perception is that it’s overwhelmingly complicated and vast, so even the best e-commerce companies have not put in the time and effort they should have to figure out how to take advantage of all the available features.
- There are a few marketers out there who have, though, and the data they access helps them beat their competition every day. They understood that whatever time they invested in learning Google Analytics would not be much compared with the huge returns the knowledge they gained could deliver. Marketers who put in the effort to really understand the nuances and subtleties of the platforms explored in this book can and will dominate.
- In the meantime, when this book comes out I’ll be storytelling all over the place, throwing jabs and right hooks at every opportunity. Maybe I’ll put out a nine-second video on Facebook, then follow up with a short tweet accompanied by a link to Amazon. At the same time, you might find a picture of the jacket on Instagram, and then an animated GIF of the same picture doing wheelies on Tumblr. I’ll have to figure it out. No matter what, though, I’ll always be telling the same story—about social media, about business, and about how they really are now one and the same.

## ROUND 12: KNOCKOUT

- Just days before I was supposed to turn in the drop-dead, final version of the manuscript for this book to my editor, Instagram launched a fifteen-second video product that competes directly with Vine. I was in Cannes, and as soon as I could, I went back to my hotel room and spent four hours looking at every Instagram video I could find. And since then, my team at VaynerMedia and I, and all of the most progressive marketers in the world, have been scrambling to figure out the best way to storytell in fifteen seconds of video on a platform built for pictures. I can’t think of a more fitting illustration of what kind of world we live in now.
- I have bad news: Marketing is hard, and it keeps getting harder. But there’s no time to mourn the past or to feel sorry for ourselves, and there’s no point in self-pity anyway. It is our job as modern-day storytellers to adjust to the realities of the marketplace, because it sure as hell isn’t going to slow down for us.
- The upside of moving quickly onto new platforms has been proved time and time again. The people and brands that overindex on Instagram and Pinterest are not necessarily the same ones who saw popularity on Facebook or Twitter—they just got to the new platforms first and figured them out sooner than anyone else. They’re the ones that got out there and started testing, learning, and watching others. They went all in.
