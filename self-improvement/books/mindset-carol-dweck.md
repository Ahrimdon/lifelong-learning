## Mindset: The New Psychology of Success

- Starting sentences with **ands** and **buts**, ending sentences with prepositions, plural **they** in contexts.

### Chapter 1: The Mindsets

- "I love a challenge!" Kids knew that human qualities such as intellectual skills could be cultivated. They didn't think they were failing, they thought they were learning.
- Some people claim that people are different because of physical differences (phrenology, craniology, and today, genes). Others: background or experiences or training. The IQ test was originally designed to see which children were not profiting from the Paris public schools so we can help them.
- **The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.**
  - Believing that your qualities are carved in stone (the fixed mindset) creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over. Having this causes people to try to prove themselves, "will I succeed or fail", "will I look smart or dumb", "will I be accepted or rejected", etc.
  - Growth mindset: the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others. Though people differ in every which way, everyone can change and grow through application and experience.
  - **Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow?** The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, especially when it's not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.
- Example of view: getting a C+. You're disappointed.
  - For fixed mindset people, it's "I'm an idiot." "I feel worthless." "Somebody upstairs doesn't like me." "The world is out to get me." "I'm unlucky."
  - Their coping is: "Do nothing." "Stay in bed." "Get drunk." "Eat." "Yell at someone." "Pick a fight with somebody." "Cry." This happens if you think that there is nothing to gain anyway.
  - Growth mindset: "I need to try harder in class." "I need to be more careful." "I'd need to work a lot harder in this class."
  - Coping: "Studying harder, or in a different way." "Chat with my teacher."
- For FM people, it "nothing ventured, nothing gained" becomes "nothing ventured, nothing lost."
- Studies show that people suck at estimating their abilities, but it was FM people who accounted for almost all the inaccuracy. GM people were usually accurate.
- You have to be open to accurate information about your current abilities. Exceptional individuals have a special talent for identifying their own strengths and weaknesses.

### Chapter 2: Inside the Mindsets

- The world of fixed traits: success is about proving you're smart or talented.
  - Failure = having a setback. Losing a tournament. Getting fired, getting rejected.
- The world of changing qualities: it's about stretching yourself to learn something new.
  - Failure = not growing. Not reaching for the things you value, not fulfilling your potential.
- You have a choice. Mindsets are just beliefs. They're powerful beliefs, but they're just something in your mind, and you can change your mind.
- All infants are learners. What makes people non-learners?
  - The FM. *As soon as children become able to evaluate themselves, some of them become afraid of challenges.* They become afraid of not being smart.
  - Kids in FM: would rather do the same easy puzzle than try a harder puzzle. GM: why would anyone want to keep doing the same puzzle over and over?
  - Girl: "I think intelligence is something you have to work for, it isn't just given to you, if I'm wrong, at least my mistake will be corrected." "I don't get this, can you help me?"
- Brain-wave lab in Columbia.
  - FM people were only interested when the feedback reflected on their ability. But if they were presented with information that could help them learn, there was no sign of interest. Even when they'd gotten an answer wrong, they were not interested in learning what the right answer was.
  - Only GM people paid attention to information that could stretch their knowledge.
- Relationships.
  - FM people want their ideal mate to put them on a pedestal, make them feel perfect, worship them.
  - GM people want their ideal mate to see their faults and help them to work on them, challenge them to become a better person, and encourage them to learn new things.
  - Ex: of GM woman married to an FM man: the man's idea of a successful relationship = total, uncritical acceptance. The wife's idea of a successful relationship (confronting problems) was not the husband's.
- "This is hard, this is fun."
- "When do you feel smart?"
  - FM: "When I don't make mistakes." "When I finish something fast and it's perfect."
  - GM: "When it's really hard, and I try really hard, and I can do something I couldn't do before."
- "Becoming is better than being." The FM does not allow people the luxury of becoming. They have to already be.
- Failure = not an identity, it's an action. "I failed" vs "I am a failure."
- John Wooden: "You aren't a failure until you start to blame." What he means is that you can still be in the process of learning form your mistakes until you deny them. (The tennis player who blamed everything else but him.)
- Depression in students: FM students. They thought about their problems, and those just kept torturing them. GM students: the more they got depressed, the more they took action to confront their problems. The worse they felt, the more determined they became!
- FM: "If you have to work at something, then you must not be good at it."
- High effort:
  - "Nothing is harder than saying, I gave it my all and it wasn't good enough."
  - Effort becomes terrifying to the FM people because "geniuses don't need effort."
  - It also robs you of all your excuses. No more "I could have been [blank], but I didn't."
- On changing: just by knowing those mindsets, you can change.
- On confidence: FM people can also have confidence. But their confidence is more fragile since setbacks and effort can undermine it.

- Grow your mindset
  - Remember the time something became hard and you were inventing excuses (tired, dizzy) to quit. It's the fixed mindset. Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn.
  - Do you want to be perfect and never grow?
  - How do you learn from your bad experiences>
  - Do you work harder at things when you feel depressed, or do you let them go?

### Chapter 3: The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment

- Edison: he had a team of scientists behind him to make the light bulb. Even though, he rode the rails from city to city learning everything he could about telegraphy.
- Darwin's Origin of Species, Mozart.
- Transitioning to junior high school:
  - FM: "I suck at math." "That teacher sucks."
  - GM: Mobilize resources for effort.
  - George Dantzig: Mistook 2 unsolved statistics problems on the board as his homework and solved them, lol. [Reference](https://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp)
- **FM: adolescents mobilize their resources not for learning, but to protect their egos.**
- "In school, my main goal is to do things as easily as possible so I don't have to work very hard." Low effort syndrome to assert independence from adults, but also to protect themselves.
- For GM students, it doesn't make sense to stop trying. Adolescence is a time of opportunity: a time to learn new subjects.
- Betty Edwards: After 5 days, here students are so good in drawing.
- Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn't mean that others can't do it with training.
- "The Creative Habit". Jackson Pollock = dedication.
- 40% of ability-praised students lied about their scores. In the FM, imperfections are shameful, so they lied them away. **You can turn ordinary children into liars simply by telling them they were smart.** Don't label people.
- Negative labels are bad:
  - African Americans are stereotyped as lower in intelligence and women are stereotyped as bad at math and science.
  - Even checking a box to indicate your race or sex can trigger that stereotype and lower your test score.
  - Blacks are equal to whites in their performance, and females are equal to males.
  - But if you remind them of the stereotype, they fill people's minds with distracting thoughts, with secret worries about confirming the stereotype.
- FM: feel a shrinking sense of belonging if they feel are getting stereotyped.
- Boys are constantly being scolded and punished. Boys get 8 times more criticism for their conduct. Boys are also constantly calling each other slobs and morons. The evaluations lose a lot of their power.
- You can't just assume that people are more talented. Probably at the start or at the end, but at the middle, you have to put in the effort.
- Don't label your kids. Find growth mindset ways to compliment them.

### Sports: The Mindset of a Champion

- Billy Beane: Mindset/no idea of how to fail.
- Muhammad Ali: Not really fundamentally sound physical wise but he had a mindset.
- Character: It's the ability to dig down and find the strength even when things are going against you.
- Hero: loss, vulnerability near defeat, a comeback, and a final triumph.
- Most difficult thing in soccer: mental toughness. Everyone wants to knock you down.
- Jackie Joyner-Kersee: "For me the joy of athletics has never reside in winning. I derive just as much happiness from the process as from the results. I don't mind losing as long as I see improvement or feel I've done as well as I possibly could. If I lose, I just go back to the track and work some more."
- Mia Hamm: The country falls in love with your team if they see that we truly love what we do and we gave everything we had to each other and to each game.
- **Those with the GM found setbacks motivating.**
- **People with the growth mindset in sports took charge of the processes that bring success and that maintain it.**
  - Michael Jordan: With losing stamina and agility, he got better at conditioning and his moves.
  - Tiger Woods: Coach said "The golf swing is just about the farthest things from a perfectible discipline in athletics."
  - Tiger's dad: kept on distracting him when he was swinging, so he can become less distractible.

### Business: Mindset and Leadership

- Enron: judged on talent. When people live in an environment that esteems them for their innate talent, they have difficulty when their image is threatened.
- "Good to Great": The type of leader that was self-effacing and who constantly asked questions and had the ability to confront the most brutal answers--to look failures in the face, even their own, while maintaining faith that they would succeed in the end.
- GM. Human development. Not trying to prove they're better than others. No highlighting of pecking orders, no claiming credits for other people's contributions, no undermining others to feel powerful.
- They are constantly trying to improve. They surround themselves with the most able people they can find, they look squarely at their own mistakes and deficiencies, and they ask what skills they and the company will need in the future.
- Alan Wurtzel.
- FM: Some people are superior, some are inferior. They must repeatedly affirm that they are superior, and the company is simply a platform for this.
- Reputation for personal greatness: they set up the company to fail when their regime ended. Personal ego.
- FM: Want to be the big fish so they feel better than the rest. No mentoring or employee development programs.
- Jack Welch (GE): Chatting with front-line employees.
  - Select people for mindset. What I was really looking for was people who were filled with passion and a desire to get things done.
  - Got ride of brutal bosses. The approved way to foster productivity is through mentoring, not through terror.
- Groupthink: this can happen if an FM leader punishes dissent.
- GM: "This company genuinely supports risk-taking and will support me even if I fail."

### Chapter 6: Relationships

- Bad thing: wanting to take revenge on other people.
- If you have an FM, you can feel that you are this kind of person.
- "I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and feel sorry for myself!"
- "To understand all is to forgive all." For GM people, it's forgiveness: "Good luck to him and good luck to me." No permanently branded.
- FM: "Your partner is fixed, and your relationship is fixed."
- Problem: "If you have to work at it, it wasn't meant to be."
  - GM: A good, lasting relationship comes from effort and from working through inevitable differences.
  - "If you're compatible, everything should just come naturally."
- Problem: "My partner should know what I think, feel, and need and I should know what my partner thinks, feels, and needs."
- Problem: "Problems are a sign of deep-seated flaws."
  - Blaming the partner's traits/character flaw/personality for the problem. They feel anger and disgust toward them. Since fixed traits, unsolvable.
- Choosing a partner is like choosing a set of problems. There are no problem-free candidates. The trick is to acknowledge each other's limitations, and build from there.
- Shy FM people: Wanted to avoid meeting someone more socially skilled. Shy GM people: Take control of your shyness, and after your nerves settle down, their relationships proceed normally.
- Bullying: judging someone to have a different worth than you.
- GM: "I am working on getting along with people."
- Blaming: Just create another guy (Maurice) and blame him instead. Or how about curing yourself of the need to blame.

### Chapter 7: Where Do Mindsets Come From?

- No parent thinks, "I wonder what I can do today to undermine my children."
- GM message: "You are a developing person and I am committed to your development."
- "Who made those ugly pictures?" -> "You can paint mean pictures if you feel like it."
- "Who broke this fire engine?" -> "Toys are for playing. Sometimes they get broken."
- "You're so smart. You're so talented. You're a natural athlete." -> Kids with FM will be obsessed with this.
- If you keep on praising their brains and talent, this makes children doubt themselves as soon as anything is hard or anything goes wrong.
- If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, seek new strategies, and keep on learning.
  - "Wow, you really studied for your test and your improvement shows it."
  - "I like the way you tried different strategies until you finally got it!"
  - "I like that you took on that hard project. That was hard!"
  - **"I know school used to be easy for you and you used to feel like the smart kid all the time. But the truth is that you weren't using your brain to the fullest. I'm really excited about how you're stretching yourself now and working to learn hard things."**
  - "I liked the effort you put in, but let's work together some more and figure out what it is you don't understand."
  - "We all have different learning curves. Keep at it."
  - "Everyone learns in a different way. Let's keep trying to find the way that works for you."
- Haim Ginott: Praise should deal with efforts/achievements, not the child's personality attributes.
- Talk about mathematicians not as people who are geniuses, but as people who worked hard to get there.
- "We care about your learning, and we know that you've learned your stuff. We're proud that you've stuck to it and kept learning."
- Messages About Failure
  - "You're the best!": Insincere.
  - "You were robbed!": Putting blame on others (judges), not with her performance.
  - "Gymnastics doesn't matter!": Teaches her to devalue something if she doesn't do well in it right away.
  - "You have the ability and will surely win next time." You are basing the thing on ability.
  - "You didn't deserve to win.": Hardhearted and honestly kind of a dick move.
  - What you should say: "I know how you feel, it's disappointing, but you know, you haven't really earned it yet. There are many girls who have been there longer than you and who've worked a lot harder than you. If this is something you really want, then it's something you'll really have to work for." If you want to have fun, that's fine. If you want to compete, more is required.
- Don't label yourself.
- Bad message: "We just want you to get into Harvard." Bad because the worth of the kid will be contingent on him getting into that school.
- You want them to love learning. Learn and think for themselves. No shortcuts. I just love children and work harder than a lot of people, and so will you.
- "In this school we have to learn, and Mrs. Collins says I can't fool around, so will you please pick me up."
- John Wooden
  - "You have to apply yourself each day to become a little better. By applying yourself to the task of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become a lot better."
  - "Full preparation and full effort. You may be outscored, but you will never lose."
  - If players coasted during practice: "Gentlemen, practice is over."
  - Bill Walton: "The real competition he was preparing us for was life. He taught us the values and characteristics that could make us not only good players, but also good people."
  - "For me, concern, compassion, and consideration were always priorities of the highest order."
- Pat Summitt
  - Beware of success. It can knock you into a fixed mindset.

#### False Growth Mindset

- **Misunderstanding #1: Many people take what they like about themselves and call it a "growth mindset."** There is a difference between being flexible/open-minded and being dedicated to growing talent. If people drift away from the actual meaning of a growth mindset, they drift away from its benefits.
- **Misunderstanding #2: Many people believe that a growth mindset is only about effort, especially praising effort.** We want children to appreciate the fruits of hard work, figure out strategies, and seek input from others. You also don't have to always be praising. Inquiring about the child's process and just showing interest in it goes a very long way.
- **Misunderstanding #3:** A growth mindset equals telling kids they can do anything. Doing anything means helping them gain the skills/find the resources to make progress toward their goals.

### Chapter 8: Changing Mindsets

- When you learn new things, tiny connections in the brain actually multiply and get stronger. The more that you challenge your mind to learn, the more your brain cells grow. Then, things that you once found very hard or even impossible seem to become easy.
- "You're in charge of your mind. You can help it grow by using it in the right way."
- Opening yourself up to growth:
   - Rejected graduate school application: "I don't want to dispute your decision, I just want to know, if I decide to apply again in the future, how can I improve my application. I would be very grateful if you could give me some feedback along those lines."
   - Even if you failed, you could still have taken the growth-mindset step. You can still feel miserable and still reach out for information that will help you improve.

#### People Who Don't Want to Change

- Entitlement: The world owes you so and so. Give up the idea of being superior, and recognize that some people stand out because of their commitment and effort.
- Denial: "My life is perfect." You can think that the marriage isn't inherently good or bad, it's just that it was an evolving thing that had stopped developing for lack of nourishment.

- Good idea to ask your child what they learned today, what mistakes they made, what did they try hard at today.
- Encourage them to talk the ways they learned to make friends, help others. You want to communicate that feats of intellect or physical prowess are not all you care about.
- Getting into a high school that focuses more on learning than getting high grades and good test scores.

- Maintaining change: If you've lost weight, the issue doesn't go away.
  - Alcoholics Anonymous: "You will always be alcoholics." You will always be vulnerable.
  - Mindset change is not about picking up a few pointers here and there, it's about seeing things in a new way. Commit to growth, and growth takes plenty of time, effort, and mutual support to achieve and maintain.

#### The Journey

- Embrace your fixed mindset.
- Where does your fixed mindset persona come home to roost? Thinking about a big, new, challenge? When you're struggling with something? When you encounter someone better than you?  When was the last time you had a fixed mindset?
- Giving your fixed persona a name. Most kids can write about their fixed-mindset persona, its triggers, and its impact.
- You have to keep setting goals for growth.
- **What are the opportunities for learning and growth today for myself, and for the people around me?**
