## Daring Greatly: How the Courage to be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead

> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better."

> "The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly..."

### Introduction: My Adventures in the Arena

- Social work: not about fixing, it's about contextualizing and leaning in.
- Social work is all about leaning into the discomfort of ambiguity and uncertainty, and holding open an empathic space so people can find their own way. In a word, messy.
- "What do the people who are the most resilient to shame, who believe in their worthiness (the whole-hearted) have in common?

- Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, "No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough. I am enough. It's going to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn't change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging.
  - We're hardwired for connection, it's what gives us purpose and meaning to our lives. The absence of love, belonging, and connection always leads to suffering.
  - There are people who feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging simply because they are worthy of love and belonging. They don't have easier lives, but in the midst of all these struggles, they have developed practices that enable them to hold on to the belief that they are worthy of love, belonging, and even joy.
  - A strong belief in our worthiness doesn't just happen--it's cultivated when we understand the guideposts as choices and daily practices.
  - They want to live a life defined by courage, compassion, and connection.
  - The wholehearted identify vulnerability as the catalyst for courage, compassion, and connection.
- Vulnerability is the core, the heart, and the center of meaningful human experiences.
- Emotional accessibility = bad for credibility?
- How do you risk being really vulnerable and tell stories about your journey without looking like a total flake?
- Perfection doesn't exist, and what makes children happy doesn't always prepare them to be courageous, engaged adults.
- **What we know matters, but who we are matters more. Being rather than knowing requires showing up and letting ourselves be seen. It requires us to dare greatly, to be vulnerable.** The first step of that journey is understanding where we are, what we're up against, and where we need to go.

### Chapter 1: Scarcity: Looking Inside out Culture of "Never Enough"

- Narcissism? In music, they found a decrease in usages of "we" and "us" and an increase in "I" and "me".
- From the vulnerability lens: I see the shame-based fear of being ordinary.
- Never feeling extraordinary enough to be noticed, to be loveable, to belong, or to cultivate a sense of purpose.
- Scarcity: the never-enough problem. (Never good, perfect, thin, powerful, successful, smart...)
- **Scarcity thrives in a culture where everyone is hyper-aware of lack.**
- Components:
  - **Shame.** Is fear of ridicule and belittling used to manage people and/or to keep people in line? Is self-worth tied to achievement, productivity, or compliance?
  - **Comparison.** One narrow standard rather than acknowledged for their unique gifts and contributions? One form of talent that is used as a measurement of everyone else's worth?
  - **Disengagement.** Are people afraid to take risks or try new things? Is everyone struggling to be seen and heard?

### Chapter 2: Debunking the Vulnerability Myths

- **Myth #1: "Vulnerability is Weakness."**
  - It isn't good or bad. It's the core of all emotions and feelings. To feel is to be vulnerable. To believe vulnerability is weakness is to believe that feeling is weakness. To foreclose on our emotional life out of a fear that the costs will be too high is to walk away from the very thing that gives purpose and meaning to living.
  - **I define vulnerability as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.** Love: uncertain, we are not sure if who we love also loves us, and we are not sure if their safety is certain.
  - Putting our art, our writing, our photography, our ideas out with no assurance of acceptance or appreciation--that's also vulnerability.
  - Sinking into the joyful moments of our lives even though we know that they are fleeting, that's vulnerability.
- Problem: We are confusing feeling with failing and emotions with liabilities.
- **Common vulnerabilities don't really sound like weaknesses. They sound like truth and feel like courage. Truth and courage aren't always comfortable, but they're never weakness.**
- How does vulnerability feel? **Naked.**
- "What's worth doing, even if I fail?"
  - I am passionate about my work and I believe in what I've learned from my research participants. I believe honest conversations about vulnerability and shame can change the world.
  - Both of the talks are flawed and imperfect, but I walked into the arena and I gave it my best shot.
- **Myth #2: I Don't Do Vulnerability.**
- **Myth #3: Vulnerability is Letting It All Hang Out.**
  - Oversharing?
  - Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them. Being vulnerable and open is mutual and an integral part of the trust-building process.
  - Not TMI.
- How do friends get their marbles? One marble at a time. "One thing that needs trust" at a time.
- Same with betrayal. You get it one marble at a time. Being disengaged, etc.
- **Myth #4: We Can Go It Alone.**
  - Asking for support is critical, and that vulnerability and courage are contagious.
  - This starts when the leader is willing to be vulnerable with his or her subordinates.
  - Often, the people who love you are with you in the arena, fighting for you and with you.

### Chapter 3: Understanding and Combating Shame

- "Only when we're brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light." - Snape.
- Don't attach your self-worth to your art or your product. Shame can hijack your life if that happens.
- Let folks like, respect, and admire, but your self-worth is not on the table. **You are more than a painting, an innovative idea, a pitch, a sermon, or a high Amazon.com ranking.**
- When our self-worth isn't on the line, we are far more willing to be courageous and risk sharing our raw talents and gifts. Shame-resilient cultures are open to soliciting, accepting, and incorporating feedback.
- Understand what the little voices/gremlins are is critical to overcoming shame because we can't always point to a certain moment or specific put-down at the hands of another person.
- Shame derives its power from being unspeakable--that's why it loves perfectionists--it's so easy to keep us quiet.
- Shame
  - We all have it.
  - We're afraid to talk about it.
  - The less we talk about shame, the more control it has over our lives.
- **Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging.**
- Categories
  - Appearance/body image
  - Money/work
  - Motherhood/fatherhood
  - Family
  - Parenting
  - Mental and physical health
  - Addiction
  - Sex
  - Aging
  - Religion
  - Surviving trauma
  - Being stereotyped or labeled
- Guilt: "I did something bad." Shame: "I am bad."
- People believe they deserve their shame, but not their humiliation.

### Shame Resilience

- **Recognizing Shame and Understanding Its Triggers.** Can you physically recognize when you're in the grips of shame, feel your way through it, and figure out what messages and expectations triggered it?
- **Practicing Critical Awareness.** Can you reality-check the messages and expectations that are driving your shame? Are they realistic, attainable?
- **Reaching Out.** Are you owning and sharing your story? We can't experience empathy if we're not connecting.
- **Speaking Shame.** Are you talking about how you feel and asking for what you need when you feel shame?

- A lot of different factions in your brain try to influence the channel of your behavior.
- Shame responses: flight or fight response, run/hide/etc..
  - Move away (withdrawing/hiding/silencing/keeping secrets).
  - Move toward (appease and please).
  - Move against: by gaining power over others, being aggressive, by using shame to fight shame.

- Trust the process:
  - **Practice courage and reach out. Share your experience with someone who has earned the right to hear it (someone who loves us, not despite our vulnerabilities, but because of them.**
  - **Talk to myself the way I would talk to someone I really love and whom I'm trying to comfort in the midst of a meltdown. Reframe things to make it seem like you're talking to someone else because you sometimes treat yourself differently (in a bad way) than if it's about another person.**
  - **Own the story. If you own this story, YOU GET TO WRITE THE ENDING. If you own this story, you get to write the ending. "I am not what has happened to me. I am what I choose to become."**
- A good reminder: empathy.
- Own up your things re: the email she sent back to the guy hehe.
- The act of not discussing a traumatic event or confiding it to another person can be more damaging than the actual event. Conversely, when people shared their stories and experiences, their physical health improved, their doctor's visits decreased, and they showed significant decreases in their stress hormones.
- Shame sharing: "I've been reading a book and there's a chapter about shame. I'd love to talk about it with you. If I lend you my book, will you take a look?"
- Men: "We have shame, but when we reach out and share our stories, we get the emotional shit beat out of us."

### Women and the Shame Web

- Look perfect, do perfect.
- Being judged by other mothers.
- Being exposed.
- No matter what I achieve or how far I've come, where I come from and what I've survived will always keep me from feeling like I'm good enough.
- Even though everyone knows that there's no way to do it all, everyone still expects it.
- Never enough at home, never enough at work, never enough in bed, never enough with my parents.
- No seat at the cool table, the pretty girls are laughing.

- Primary trigger: how they look.
- Secondary: motherhood, if they haven't married, if they're married, why they haven't had children.
- Real struggle: to be perfect, yet we're not allowed to look as if we're working for it. We want it to just materialize somehow.
- It's always "she makes it look so easy" and "she's a natural."
- Who we should be, what we should be, and how we should be.

- The expectations:
  - Be perfect, but don't make a fuss about it and don't take away time from anything, to achieve your perfection.
  - Don't upset anyone or hurt anyone's feelings.
  - Daily the sexuality up, but down at the PTO meeting.
  - Just be yourself, but not if it means being shy or unsure.
  - Don't make people feel uncomfortable, but be honest.
  - Don't get too emotional, but don't be too detached either. Too emotional = hysterical. Too detached = being a cold-hearted bitch.
- Female norms: being nice, pursuing a thin body ideal, showing modesty, being domestic, caring for children, investing in a romantic relationship, keeping sexual intimacy contained within one committed relationship, using our resources to invest in our appearance.
- Every successful woman has the struggle of pushing past "the rule" so she can assert herself, advocate for her ideas, and feel comfortable with her power and gifts.
- Today's cruelty culture: everyone is fair game. They went after her appearance and her mothering. Not intellect or arguments, those wouldn't hurt enough.
- Give yourself permission to feel shame for a couple of hours and days, then I reached out, talked talked through my feelings with people I trust and love, and I moved on. I felt more courageous, more compassionate, more connected.
- **I stopped reading anonymous comments. If you're not in the arena with the rest of us, fighting and getting your ass kicked on occasion, I'm not interested in your feedback.**

### Men

- Shame is failure. Shame is being wrong. Shame is a sense of being defective. Shame happens when people think you're soft. Revealing any weakness is shaming. Showing fear is shameful. Shaming is being seen as "the guy you can shove up against the lockers." Our worst fear is being criticized or ridiculed-either one of these is extremely shaming.
- "Do not be perceived as weak." "Don't be a pussy."
- Reaction: either being pissed off or shut down.

- We are hard on others because we're hard on ourselves. That's exactly how judgment works. "If you're doing worse than I am at something, I think, my chances of surviving are better.
- Lifeguarding: a desperate person will do anything to save themselves to grab a breath, that they can drown you in their effort to survive.
- **Research tells us that we judge people in areas where we're vulnerable to shame, especially picking folks who are doing worse than we're doing.** If I feel good about my body, I don't go around making fun of other people's weight or appearance.
- Children who have bullying behaviors/social ranking have parents who have the same behaviors.

- Women, who feel shame when they don't feel heard or validated, often resort to pushing and provoking with criticism ("why don't you ever do enough?")
- Men, who feel shame when they feel criticized for being inadequate, either shut down (so women poke and provoke more) or come back with anger.
- Feeling shame is incredibly painful, and that perpetrating shame is equally as painful, and it's most painful if its from a partner or a parent. We can apologize to them, but those shaming comments leave marks.
- **Masculine attributes: winning, emotional control, risk-taking, violence, dominance, playboy, self-reliance, primacy of work, power over women, disdain for homosexuality, pursuit of status.**
- Men and women with high levels of shame resilience: they know these lists exist. They keep those structures in mind so that they can self-check using critical awareness.
  - "I'm not supposed to get emotional when I lay off these people" vs "I'm supposed to care about these people. I've worked with these guys for five years."
  - "You're not a good mother because you're going to miss your son's class play" vs "My mothering is way bigger than one class performance."
  - Our relationships are defined by women and men saying, "I'll play my role, and you play yours." Men feel their fear of failure is paralyzing. Women are exhausted, and for the first time they see that their expectations are impossible.
- "Once you are Real, you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."

## Chapter 4: The Vulnerability Armory

## Notes

- On wholehearted living: I think this is an exercise that I have to do everyday, seeing as it's so hard to be surrounded by extremely smart and accomplished people that you feel that you have to bring you A-game.
- Especially in open source, writing, programming, what you do (creative work) can always be critiqued. People can always say something bad about the thing. You need to: filter if who is saying the thing actually knows what they are doing and is not just a hater, objectively look at things and see if it's correct, and edit your thing.
- I can't recall of a single person who was not confident in presenting themselves or their work.
- What is the worst thing that can happen if you give a speech? As long as the speech has some degree of preparation behind it, people will either forget about it or like it. Just prepare for the speech and know that you will add some value to other people's lives and remember, it sometimes just takes one idea in a speech to make the speech worth it.
- "This is not the story where I fucking suck. This is the story where it sucked and I pushed through it."
- Haters: I know that the people who really trust the process/honor the struggle know how hard it is to publish something (photo, code, blog entry, etc.)
- Haters: Really, fuck cruel people. I know that I probably was a hater at some point. I mean, I still am in some regards to some people. But I cannot hate people who give it their all and put their thing out in the world. It's so scary and the process takes a lot of time to do.
- On being perceived as a weak man: well it always comes back to how many skills you have. People can't really judge you if you have more skills than them. People respect your for your skills and your use to society.
- Do women nag because of the thing about "when they don't feel heard and validated"?
