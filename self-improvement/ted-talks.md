## [Jonathan Haidt: The moral roots of liberals and conservatives](http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html)

It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience. People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel. People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.

If you know about this trait, you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. You can understand why artists are so different from accountants. You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read, what kinds of places they like to travel to, and what kinds of food they like to eat.This trait also tells us a lot about politics. The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that, "Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views" -- they like a society which is open and changing -- "whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views."

This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. So here's the description of a group I found on the Web. What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture, who seek a deeper understanding of the world, and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all? This is from some guy named Ted. (Laughter) Well, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal, and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster, then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal? (Lots of liberals, some libertarian, few conservatives.)

OK. This is a bit of a problem. Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. Because when people all share values, when people all share morals, they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking. When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004, and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves. (Laughter) We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team. We think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.

The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth. Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds, and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises. Built-in doesn't mean unmalleable; it means organized in advance of experience." OK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind? 

What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines? That you find across cultures and even across species? We found five -- five best matches, which we call the five foundations of morality.

- Harm/care. We have neural/hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others, care for others, feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.
- Fairness/reciprocity. There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals, but the evidence for people could not be clearer. 
- In-group/loyalty. It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.
- Authority/respect.But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality, as it is in other primates. It's based on more voluntary deference, and even elements of love, at times.
- Purity/sanctity. Political left: Food is moralized. (Think grain-fed stuff.)

Liberals: Harm/care, fairness, not so much on the others. Conservatives: All five. Different countries have different results. This matters even in small things such as choosing a dog: liberals like independent-minded breeds, conservatives like loyal breeds.

Research says that it's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. It really helps to have some sort of punishment. Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip, you need some sort of punishment to bring people, when they're in large groups, to cooperate.  There's even some recent research suggesting that religion -- priming God, making people think about God -- often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.

How did people cooperated enough to form Babylon, Rome, and Tenochtitlan? The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox. It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm, you do need a psychology of justice. But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups, and if those sub-groups have some internal structure, and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends. And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. Because liberals reject three of these foundations. They say "No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership." They say, "Let's question authority." And they say, "Keep your laws off my body."

Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive, and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in. So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos. This guy's shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution." If you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good, it's change, it's fun. 

Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions. They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom. The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve. It's really precious, and it's really easy to lose. So as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."

You can't just go charging in, saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right." Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right. A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people. And if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are -- understand our moral psychology, understand that we all think we're right -- and then step out, even if it's just for a moment, step out -- check in with Seng-ts'an. Step out of the moral matrix, just try to see it as a struggle playing out, in which everybody does think they're right, and everybody, at least, has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them -- everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. Step out. And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility, to get yourself out of this self-righteousness, which is the normal human condition. Think about the Dalai Lama. Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama -- and it comes from his moral humility.

So I think the point -- the point of my talk, and I think the point of TED -- is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all. Thank you.

## [Sam Harris: Science can answer moral questions](http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html)

It's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion. It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value.

This illusion is dangerous because values are a certain kind of fact. They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.

We don't feel compassion towrds rocks because we don't think rocks can suffer. We are also more concerned about primates than insects because they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering. 

All versions of human moralities are concerned about conscious experiences. Even if you believe in the aterlife, you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.

We know that there is a continuum of the conditions of well-being in life. We know what a failed and what a successful state is. We know right and wrong answers on how to move in this space, too. Ex, it would not be a good idea to add cholera to the water.

We now that our experience of the world happens in our brain, regardless of what happens in our death. A suicide bomber's personality is the product of his brain. Culture changes us, and culture changes our brains. I'm not saying that science can have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. But just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality, and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future.

Ex: 21 states say that it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wodden board. The rationale is religious: Proverbs 13. Is it a good idea though, to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior? Is there any doubt that this question has an answer, and that it matters?

Well-being can be redefined in the same way that physical health can be redefined. What was healthy in in 1930 is different from what is healthy now. Think about food. There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food. But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison. The fact that there are many right answers to the question, "What is food?" does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition. Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.

> Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere. Consider the great problem of women's bodies: What to do about them? Well this is one thing you can do about them: You can cover them up. Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that while we may not like this, we might think of this as "wrong" in Boston or Palo Alto, who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags? And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable, or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?

> Well, who are we not to say this? Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this? I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned. But what does voluntary mean in a community where, when a girl gets raped, her father's first impulse, rather often, is to murder her out of shame?

> Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute: Your daughter gets raped, and what you want to do is kill her. What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?

> Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society. For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world. Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. (Laughter) But if we are in a reflective mood, we can ask, "Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?" I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children? Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. 

There are ways to not be on a moral peak. The ironic thing is that people who generally agree are religious demagogues of one form or another.

The endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering. This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue. But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need a universal conception of human values.

Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded. That is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise, or moral talent, or moral genius even? How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count? How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering? Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No. How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?

So, this, I think, is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing, and morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible for individuals, and even for whole cultures, to care about the wrong things, which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality. We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less, and they will one day mean nothing.

## [Dan Ariely: What makes us feel good about our work?](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_what_makes_us_feel_good_about_our_work.html)

Naive intuition: People care about the money, and when we give them money, we can direct them to work another way. So we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways.

But people climb mountains. While climbing a mountain, there's nothing but misery. Even after doing such as terrible activity, they climb the mountain again. It is about the flight, the challenge.

Guy that was making a PowerPoint about a company merger was excited about actually doing the thing. But when the merger was cancelled, he was depressed knowing that nobody would watch the presentation.

Bionicle expriment: Sisyphusian condition sucked! People made less Bionicles then. People predicted that correctly, yes, but they underestimated how much the meaning of the Bionicles was important. Even when people love Legos, they were more happy than average while building Bionicles, but when subjected to the Sisyphean condition, they felt the same as others. So breaking things in front of people's eyes crush any joy they could get out of this activity.

Ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes. By just saying "uh-huh", you can destroy people's motivations. But the good news means that adding motivation is really not so difficult.

Positive motivation with IKEA: He likes the stuff he built because he built it. The same with cake mixes, the ladies wanted to actually create the cake by beating an egg. With origami, they really liked building the shit, even though observers were unbiased and said they were just okay. Even with harder instructions, builders actually liked what they did even when evaluators thinked it sucked more.

This is why we would not sell our kids but we would also not buy other people's kids. We think our kids are really valuable because of our time and connection.

### [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: Flow, the secret to happiness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXIeFJCqsPs)

He group up in Europe/WW2 and he realized that just few grown-ups were able to withstand the tragedies of the war. He studied philosophy, art, religion to figure out the answer, and he encountered psych.

US: Just 30% of the people since 1956 say they are very happy. No change, regardless of the doublng and tripling of personal income (even when counting for inflation). (This applies to people above the minimum poverty level only.)

He looked at creative peopl to understand what made them feel that it was worth spending their life doing things for which they didn't expect fame or fortune, but made their life meaningful.

"Ecstasy", Greek means you stand to the side of something. It is about stepping into an alternative reality. We see this in the ancient civilizations (China, Greece, Hindu, Mayans, Egyptians), what we know about them is their ecstasies, not their everyday life. We know temples, circuses, arenas, theaters.

This composer doesn't need to go to the place, but he just puts little marks on a piece of paper and he is able to imagine sounds and create stuff. He begins to enter a different reality. This sounds cheesy but it is because humans can only process about 110 bits of information per second. Humans talking are about 60. So you can't hear and understand more than 2 people talking to you.

When you are completely engaged, he doesn't have attention to monitor how his body feels, his problems at home. Existence is temporarily suspended.

This process can only happen when you have been trained and have developed the basic technique. In creativity you need about 10 hours to actually create something. Then the music plays out.

Successful, ethical, socially responsible CEOs define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it. Ex: Sony, the ideas was they want to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation.

The 7 conditions:

- Focus
- Leads to a sense of ecstasy/clarity
- You know exactly what to do from one moment to the other
- You get immediate feedback
- You know that you can do the thing, even though it is difficult
- Sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, and you feel part of something larger

We need to get a mean level of challenge and skill first. Then we can predict when you will be in flow, and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average.

Arousal is good when you are over-challenged a bit. Your skills are not quite as high as they should be, but you can move into flow easily by developign a little more skill. We want to be at arousal. Control is also okay, because you feel comfortable, but not very excited.

Relaxation is fine, but boredom is aversive. No challenge and it sucks. Most people experience apathy: watching TV or sitting in the bathroom.

So, how do you put more in the flow channel?

### [Elon Musk: Mahalo Mentor Interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKWPdJWuBQ)

I started Zip2 instead of going to graduate school in Stanford. I've had a long standing interest in sustainable tranport/energy. I decided to defer graduate studies and try starting an Internet company. I applied to Netscape and they didn't reply, so I just made my own company. Zip2 made software for news companies and we brought news companies to the web. I was more of an engineer that was asked to build things.

There's definitely lots of things that should be fixed about Paypal, but since I've not been part of the company in 2002, I can't really do much. There's a lot of mistakes that's still there, that I also put. I still think the fees are too high and there's more functionality that needs to be added to the system. It still has the opportunity to become the company that provides financial services.

The goal for SpaceX is to develop the technologies necessary to make life multiplanetary. We're going to try to advance space exploration as much as possible. The key invention is a fully and rapidly reusable orbit-class rocket. If we make things fully reusable, we need to take into account the additional weight to make things more robust, the things you need to return to the launchpad, etc. I think we have a good shot of achieving that, in fact the cost of fuel is very small compared to the cost of the rocket itself. It has to be fully and rapidly reusable, like a plane. The cost of launch would drop by more than 100.

### [Elon Musk: The Mind Behind Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKWPdJWuBQ)

I think we have to solve transport and sustainable energy. We need to find some sustainable means. A power plant is about 60% efficient in producing energy, compared to an internal combustion engine (20%), because the heat can be recycled in a power plant.

I think all modes of transportation will become electric. The question is how do you accelerate it for cars? We have to make the car very light, with a low drag coefficient, despite the large battery pack. So it's competitive in the order of a 200 mile range.

The goal of Tesla is: expensive price low volume, medium price medium volume, then last is low price high volume. So Roadster, then the sedan, then about 3-4 years. Generally in tech you need 3 versions to make a compelling product. We're building a supercharger network. We have a ratio of drive to stop of 6-7. So you drive 3 hours then get a bit to eat while charging.

The world is entirely solar powered already, we just need to tap some of that energy. I'm confident that solar will beat everything, including natural gas. It must, if it doesn't then we are in trouble. The thing about solar is that it doesn't have operational costs. We want to get the cost of the initial installation low, and the financing low. And I think we can beat natural gas. The typical lease is 20 years, and it has to cost less than the current utility bill. This is the first time that we can have competition on the utility. I'm extermely confident that solar will be a plurality (more than any source) in the next couple years.

The goal of SpaceX is to advance Rocket Technology, we want a rapid and reusable rocket. It's sort of a standpoint of "what needs to happen if you want the future to be exciting"? I think that future is more exciting that just staying here. A space shuttle costed 1 billion dollars per flight. It's important that the rocket should return to the launch site, reusable in a few hours. The cost of the fuel is very small. All forms of transportation are reusable already, except rockets.

Elon: I work a lot. Chris: He is able to bring technology, design and business in a way that few people done, and you're confident enough to bet on this thing. Elon: I think a good framework for thinking is physics. Boil things down to the fundamental truths, not by reasoning through analogy. We need this, but when you need something new, we need to apply the physics approach. Physics has a way of describing things that are counter-intuitive. I also think it's about listening to negative feedback.

### [Andrew Stanton: The clues to a great story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDwieKpawg)

Storytelling is joke telling. It's knowing your pucnh line and your ending, knowing that everything you're saying is leading to a singular goal, and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understandings of who we are as human beings.

We love stories. Stories affirm who we are. We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning. It can cross the barriers of time, past, present, and future, and allow us to experience the similarities between ourselves and through others, real and imagined.

Greatest story commandment: "make me care". "My history is my story."

What all good stories should do at the beginning, is that they should give you a proise. It's as simple as "once upon a time...". It's like someone inviting you around the campfire.

Storytelling without dialog: it's the purest form of cinematic storytelling. The audience wants to work for their meal. Your job as storyteller is to hide the fact that you're making them work for their meal. We're born problem solvers.

__Unifying theory of two plus two: Make the audience put things together.__

I believe you're wired a certain way, and you have to recognize what that is. When you are mature enough to acknowledge what drives you, and take the wheel and steer.

__"Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty."__ Short term: What will happen next? Long term: Have you make me want to know how it will all conclude? Have you considered honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be?

Pixar: In 1993, the popular animated movies were Disney. They wanted to do something different.

- No songs
- No "I want" moment
- No happy village
- No love story
- No villain

When they were failing, a lyricist faxed them solutions:

- Songs
- "I want" moment
- Happy village
- Love story
- Villain

Liking your main character: Since we want to make Woody selfless at the end, let's make him selfish at the start. We can make a selfish character likable by making him kind, generous, funny, considerate, as long as one condition is met for him, is that he stays the top toy. _And that's what it really is, is that we all live life conditionally. We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along, as long as certain conditions are met. After that, all bets are off._

Wonder: The magic ingredient. Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent, it can't be evoked. For me, there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling.

The first lesson I learned: Use what you know. Draw from it. It doesn't mean plot or fact. It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it, expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core.

### [Let's Talk About Death: Stephen Cave at TEDxBratislava](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0E_VNX1-Yk)

At some point, all children become aware of death. 

In the evolution of our species, some of us became sophisticated enough to realize that we're going to die. We have to live in the knowledge is that one day, all of our accomplishments will be gone.

We each live in a personal apocalypse, and it's terrifying. The phrase was that "Grandpa was up there, watching us".

Bias: Ways which we get things wrong, and we distort things to fit the reality we create. Just tell anyone that people will live forever and they will do anything they can to believe it.

People who have just been reminded of their mortalities were more likely to believe in stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever. This works for not just religion, but for things such as fame and nationalism.

This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history. The theory behind this bias is called terramanagement theory: _we develop our world views, the stories we tell about the world and our place in it in order for us to manage the terror of death_.

There are just 4 basic forms the immortality stories take, they just take different forms:

- __Elixir or fountain of life.__ Ancient Egypt, Ancient Babylon, Ancient Greece, Europe, even today we have science: stem cells, genetic technology. The idea that science can cure death is just another chapter in the story of the elixir.
- __Resurrection.__ I am this physical organism, I die but I can rise up and live again. We are again reinventing this with the idea of cryonics: freeze/thaw yourself out. Instead of an omnipotent god, we have an omnipotent scientist.
- __Soul.__ Majority of the people on earth believe they have a soul, but we are now thinking of "uploading our thoughts and mind into the internet as an avatar."
- __Legacy.__ The pursuit of fame is as widespread as now as ever, we just need an Internet connection. We want to live "in the hearts of people."

We should be skeptical about the truth of any of these stories. We should think that any story involving might be affected by our bias to believe them, and we are biased to believe them because we are afraid of death.

Epicurus argued that the fear of death is natural, but it is not rational. The idea of being gone is difficult to grasp. Wittgenstein: "death is not an event in life; we do not live to experience death."

#### Imagine the book of your life. Its covers–its beginning and end–are your birth and your death. You can only know the moments in between, the moments which make up your life. It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside those covers, whether before your birth or after your death. And you needn't worry how long the book is, or whether it's a comic strip or an epic. 

#### The only things is that you make it a good story.

### [Kelly McGonigal: How to Make Stress Your Friend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGyVTAoXEU)

People who experienced a lot of stress had a 43% increased chance of dying, but only if they believed that stress was harmful. People who did not perceive stress was bad did not die as much.

Participants who were told to react differently to stress had a different _physical_ reaction. Their blood vessels did not constrict as much.

Oxytocin is a stress response. When oxytocin is released, it nudges you to tell someone how you feel, and not bottle it up. It wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you. It's natural, anti-inflammatory, and your heart has receptors for this hormone. This strengthens your heart.

Each stressful even increases dying by 30%, but people who spent time caring for others showed no stress-related increase in chance to die. Caring increases resilience.

#### When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage.

#### When you chooose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience.

### [Simon Sinek: How Great Leaders Inspire Action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4)

All the great and inspiring organizations (Why Apple? Why MLK? Why the Wright brothers?) in the world think, act, and communicate the exact same way.

#### The Golden Circle

The Why, The How, The What.

Every organization knows What they do. Some know How they do it. Very few organizations know Why they do things. Why does your organization exist? Why should anyone care?

The inspired organizations, regardless of their size, follow these.

If Apple was like traditional... _"Apple makes great computers. We're good at what we do.  Buy us!" "We have the best lawyers." "We have a good car."_

How does Apply communicate?

_"Everything we do, we believe in thinking differently, and we believe in thinking outside of the status quo. We believe in great design. We just happen to make great computers, wanna buy one?"_

People don't buy what you do, they buy WHY you do it. That's why everyone is perfectly comfortable with buying a phone or a PC from Apple.

Other manufacturers can build the technology! __Dell makes MP3 players__ but you won't buy things from it.

This is grounded in our biology (not psychology), in our brain. We have the neocortex, which is rational. But we also have the how/why: the limbic brain. These are our feelings, trust, loyalty, decision making. Not language. Controls behavior. GUT DECISIONS. "It doesn't feel right."

_You don't sell people what you have, you sell people what you believe in. You hire people who believe in what you believe in._

Ex: Wright brothers. Samuel Langley was extremely funded/connected/hired the best minds money can buy/everyone was rooting for Langley. But people believed in the Wright brothers. They also knew that if they figured out this flying machine, they could fix the world. When the Wright brothers had a product, Langley quit. This meant he was just in it for the money and not the vision.

Law of Diffusion: 2% innovators, 13% early adopters, 64% mass market (the early majority will not try something unless someone else tries it first), 16% laggers.

The early adopters are those who believe in things and are in gut feel mode. They want to be first to buy shit. They wait 6 hours for an iPhone because they believe that it is always good to be first.

People buy why you do things and what you do confirms what they believe about you.

MLK: Not really the best orator, but he believed stuff. Everyone went there not for MLK but for themselves.

* We don't just get more questions right in IQ tests, but we get higher IQ test results every generation.
* If you score the people a century ago against modern norms they would have average IQ of __70__ and if you score us against their terms we would have an average IQ of __over 130__.
* Soldiers didn't necessarily have better aim, but they had better weapons (so it looked like they were better at aiming, wherein they just had a gun with a higher rate of fire).
* Lauria: Found out that people were resistant to deducing the hypothetical, and that people didn't deal that well with abstractions. (In 1900 there was just about 4 years of schooling in Russia).
* Classification, using logic on abstractions, and taking the hypothetical seriously: how big is this effect on thinking? One, nearly everyone has an education with a scientific background, and you can't have do science without classificatio and logic and hypothesizing.
* 1900: 3% of Americans practiced professions which are cognitively demanding (lawyers, doctors). Now, 35% (add engineers and programmers) have cognitively demanding professions. The professions have also been upgraded: compare 1900 doctors with the doctors today, or 1900 bankers with the bankers today.
* Moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously. When people came home from wherever during the Civil Rights Movement, they asked parents or racists "what would you do if you woke up black", and these people would just say "that's the stupidest idea ever". They did not take the hypothetical seriously, and __without the hypothetical it is very difficult to get arguments off the ground__. Some people are just not wiling to take the hypothetical seriously.

* The gains in IQ scores have specific areas with large gains (classification, analogies).
* We don't have progress on all fronts. Sadly, you can have humane moral principles, but if you're ignorant of history and other countries then you can't do shit about history. Kids today just live in the bubble in the present. Ex: how would Americans feel if they knew that Americans have invaded Afghanistan 5 times already, and that Americans had been deceived to go to war the last 5 times (such as the sinking of the _Maine_ and that Saddam hated Al-Qaeda).

### [Russell Foster: Why do we sleep?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWULB9Aoopc)

* 36% of your life = spent sleeping. So sleep, at some level, is simportant.
* Literature about sleep has changed throughout history from sleep is awesome to sleep sucks ("money never sleeps").
* Now, we treat sleep as an enemy. Why? We think that we aren't doing anything when we are sleeping.

#### But Why?

* _Restoration:_ The stuff we burn during the day, we restore during the night. Within the brain, there are some genes that are turned on during sleep and these are associated with restoration.
* _Energy concentration:_ The energy saved when sleeping = 100 calories per night (assuming that the person didn't do much when awake). Not that efficient.
* _Learning and memory consolidation:_ The ability to solve problems are enhanced threefold by a good night's sleep. The synaptic connections are strengthened when sleeping.
* Most probably, we sleep for multiple reasons.

### Sleep Deprivation

* 1950s: 8 hours. 2013: 5-6.5 hours. Not enough! The body clock does not change when you work in shifts. Day sleep is not healthy!
* An estimated 31% of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and in the US this is a 100K accidents on the freeway associated with tiredness.
* Alchol: It doesn't make you sleep, it just mimics sleep and sedates you. Don't use it as a long-term solution.
* Weight gain: If you sleep five hours or less, you have 50% chance to be more obese because the hunger hormone is released and it gets the brain to ask for more carbohydrates.
* Stress: Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity (tired people = higher infection, people with shift work = higher risk of cancer), increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease.

#### Am I getting enough sleep?

* If you need an alarm clock, if you need stimulants, if you are grumpy, if your colleagues say you are tired, __then you probably are__.
* Make your bedroom as dark as it possibly can, and slightly cold. Decrease light exposure. Turn off phones, computers. Don't drink caffeine before sleeping.
* Do the things that you know will help you sleep.

#### Myths

* Not everyone needs 8 hours a day, it depends on the people.
* Old people do not need less sleep.
* __Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man wealthy and wise.__ That's just plain wrong, there is no evidence that sleep time is correlated to socio-economic status.

### Sleep Disruption

* In severe mental illnesses, there is alwasy sleep disruption.
* Schizophrenic individuals were awake at night and sleeping during the day. Some of them had no ability to regulate their sleep.
* Mental illness and sleep are not just associated but are physically linked in the brain.
* Sleep disruption actually preceeds certain types of mental illness (ex: bipolar people already have sleep disruption before being diagnosed for bein bipolar).
* Just take sleep seriously!

### [Chip Conley - Measuring What Makes Life Worthwhile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QUF5QfnIbc)

*	Viet refugee Vivian found "joy" in toilets but she had an emotional connection with her employees and guests. She was taking care of people far away from home because she knew what it felt like to be away from home
*	He noticed in Maslow's hierarchy saw that leaders knew that people are people. He used the hierarchy of rules to deal with people.
*	Simplified Maslow's hierarchy is = Survival-Success-Survival
*	We asked if we connected with our customers and employees in the three aspects of the pyramid
*	We usually can't measure the success/transformation part which is intangible, and what is important
*	94% of leaders believe that intangible things are important but 5% had a way of measuring what you need
*	Einstein - Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.
*	Bhutanese king wanted to measure Gross National Happiness as opposed to GDP
*	"We create the conditions to make people to be happy."
*	Indicators such as "how do you feel about the way you spend your time each day"
*	Happiness is not having what you want but its wanting what you have
*	40 countries such as Sarkozy's France are measuring GNH
*	We have to find a new way of counting shit
*	If the only thing you have is a hammer, everything seems to be a nail.
*	64% of our industry is in service and not in manufacturing so this is pretty widespread.
