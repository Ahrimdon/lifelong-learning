# Adulting: How to Become a Grown-Up

- It is these small discoveries and decisions that allow you to behave like an adult. Not really fun, but it has its perks--personal pride, financial security, and the feeling of accomplishment and control.
- Adulting is not a noun, it's a verb, it's the act of making correctly those small decisions that fill our day. If you slip up, just move forward and have milk tomorrow.
- Most of being an adult is not up in your head, it's in your actions.

## 1. Get Your Mind Right.

- *Intentions are nice, but ultimately, intentions don't matter because they only insist inside you.*

### Steps

- Accept that you are not that special.
- Appreciate those (parents, friends) who disagree with step 1.
- Don't get hurt when the world doesn't care about you. It's not that they hate you, it just has no idea who you are. People will come to care about you, but only if you give them a valid reason.
- Accept that right now, you are small time. You're starting from the beginning, just like every other person in the world must do.
- Reasonable goals: There will never be a time when every item in the house is meticulously organized in cute storage solutions.
- Stop enjoying things ironically. Just enjoy them. Things like trashy dance pop.
- Avoid shame boomerangs.
  - Shame boomerangs: shame incident -> bad feelings -> forgetting/getting distracted -> shame boomerang -> bad feelings.
  - Acknowledge the problem.
  - Figure out how you will avoid making this same mistake again.
  - Decide on a coping mechanism.
  - Really try not to make the mistake again.
- Remember your circle of concern vs your circle of action.
  - There are things you can be concerned about and things you can actually effect change on. Work on those things.
-  Begin to separate, in your mind, things that are a Valid Long-Term Plan vs Not A Valid Long-Term Plan.
  - Boyfriends you love but you know you don't want to spend the rest of your life with.
  - Smoking.
  - Jobs with little or no possibility for advancement.
  - Drinking problems.
- Be okay with being alone. NOBODY THINKS ABOUT "why is that person alone", they have their own things.
- Recognize six-month problems. When you get really upset about something, ask yourself, is this something you'll remember in six months? Most things aren't. If no, then try your best to move on.
- Distinguish between horses and zebras. "Not always, but probably."
- Pay attention to natural consequences, then learn to anticipate them. A natural consequences of splurging is you can't go out with friends. A natural consequence of hooking up with someone at work is you get to remember it when you go to a meeting together.
- Remember that you are in control of your physical self and surroundings. You can make your bed or you can not make your bed. Neither makes you a better or worse person, but you should accept that if you want to your bed to be made, there is but one person in the world who is going to do it, and that person is you.
- When necessary, look at yourself in the mirror and give yourself some real talk.  *This sounds a little crazy, but looking yourself in the eye in the mirror and saying something aloud is oddly effective. It makes whatever you are trying so hard to mentally avoid into something that exists in the real world.* It reminds you that the lies, or truths, you tell yourself are as significant as the lies and truths you tell others.
  - This relationship is over, and you need to end it.
  - Right now is not the right time to be crying at work. You are a grown-ass woman, and you're going to splash cold water on your face, take a minute to compose yourself, and then go slay it out there.
  - There is a difference between berating yourself and Real Talking yourself.
- When something bad happens to you, do not rush immediately to figure out why it wasn't your fault. What lesson can be learned here?
- Get used to giving more than you get.

## Domesticity

- Buy toilet paper in bulk. Toilet paper is something that you will always, always need. For things that you will always need, just buy in bulk.
- The right place.
  - Hot water.
  - Safety. Come back by the area at night, during the day, on the weekend, and so on.
  - Volume: Is there something loud nearby?
  - Management: Does the landlord seem reasonable? Make sure they set off no Insanity Bells. It's okay to chat with another tenant and see what kind of person you are entering into a long term legal contract with.
  - Electricity: Check all the light switches, and bring a cellphone charger.
  - Closets/storage: Do they exist?
  - Appliances.
  - Accessibility: Can your furniture logically get up the stairs and into the apartment?
  - Pets.
  - Paint. Can you paint the walls?
- Be a good tenant. 90% of this is paying your rent on time, but also be sure to alert landlords right away when there is a problem.
- Learn how to patch nail holes.
- If you need to match paint, chip off a pain sample so they can scan and match shade perfectly.
- Bare minimum:
  - Kitchen: A small table and 2 chairs.
  - Living room: A couch, bookcase or shelving, and a coffee table. Then: desk, love seat, chair, side tables, something to set up the TV in.
  - Bedroom: A bed, nightstand, and a dresser, vanity.
  - Bathroom: Storage option.
- How to decorate
  - Match your closet. Whatever you like as a person, you'll like it in home decor. Start off with an object that you really like. Whenever she wanted to add something to her room, it must match the object. Painting just one wall makes a large difference.
- Frames, not posters. Art is something else that you can slowly but surely acquire. It doesn't have to be insanely expensive, but treat them right, and get them framed.
- Get an actual bed.
