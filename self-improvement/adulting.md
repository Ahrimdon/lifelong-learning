# Adulting: How to Become a Grown-Up

- It is these small discoveries and decisions that allow you to behave like an adult. Not really fun, but it has its perks--personal pride, financial security, and the feeling of accomplishment and control.
- Adulting is not a noun, it's a verb, it's the act of making correctly those small decisions that fill our day. If you slip up, just move forward and have milk tomorrow.
- Most of being an adult is not up in your head, it's in your actions.

## 1. Get Your Mind Right.

- *Intentions are nice, but ultimately, intentions don't matter because they only insist inside you.*

### Steps

- Accept that you are not that special.
- Appreciate those (parents, friends) who disagree with step 1.
- Don't get hurt when the world doesn't care about you. It's not that they hate you, it just has no idea who you are. People will come to care about you, but only if you give them a valid reason.
- Accept that right now, you are small time. You're starting from the beginning, just like every other person in the world must do.
- Reasonable goals: There will never be a time when every item in the house is meticulously organized in cute storage solutions.
- Stop enjoying things ironically. Just enjoy them. Things like trashy dance pop.
- Avoid shame boomerangs.
  - Shame boomerangs: shame incident -> bad feelings -> forgetting/getting distracted -> shame boomerang -> bad feelings.
  - Acknowledge the problem.
  - Figure out how you will avoid making this same mistake again.
  - Decide on a coping mechanism.
  - Really try not to make the mistake again.
- Remember your circle of concern vs your circle of action.
  - There are things you can be concerned about and things you can actually effect change on. Work on those things.
-  Begin to separate, in your mind, things that are a Valid Long-Term Plan vs Not A Valid Long-Term Plan.
  - Boyfriends you love but you know you don't want to spend the rest of your life with.
  - Smoking.
  - Jobs with little or no possibility for advancement.
  - Drinking problems.
- Be okay with being alone. NOBODY THINKS ABOUT "why is that person alone", they have their own things.
- Recognize six-month problems. When you get really upset about something, ask yourself, is this something you'll remember in six months? Most things aren't. If no, then try your best to move on.
- Distinguish between horses and zebras. "Not always, but probably."
- Pay attention to natural consequences, then learn to anticipate them. A natural consequences of splurging is you can't go out with friends. A natural consequence of hooking up with someone at work is you get to remember it when you go to a meeting together.
- Remember that you are in control of your physical self and surroundings. You can make your bed or you can not make your bed. Neither makes you a better or worse person, but you should accept that if you want to your bed to be made, there is but one person in the world who is going to do it, and that person is you.
- When necessary, look at yourself in the mirror and give yourself some real talk.  *This sounds a little crazy, but looking yourself in the eye in the mirror and saying something aloud is oddly effective. It makes whatever you are trying so hard to mentally avoid into something that exists in the real world.* It reminds you that the lies, or truths, you tell yourself are as significant as the lies and truths you tell others.
  - This relationship is over, and you need to end it.
  - Right now is not the right time to be crying at work. You are a grown-ass woman, and you're going to splash cold water on your face, take a minute to compose yourself, and then go slay it out there.
  - There is a difference between berating yourself and Real Talking yourself.
- When something bad happens to you, do not rush immediately to figure out why it wasn't your fault. What lesson can be learned here?
- Get used to giving more than you get.

## Domesticity

- Buy toilet paper in bulk. Toilet paper is something that you will always, always need. For things that you will always need, just buy in bulk.
- The right place.
  - Hot water.
  - Safety. Come back by the area at night, during the day, on the weekend, and so on.
  - Volume: Is there something loud nearby?
  - Management: Does the landlord seem reasonable? Make sure they set off no Insanity Bells. It's okay to chat with another tenant and see what kind of person you are entering into a long term legal contract with.
  - Electricity: Check all the light switches, and bring a cellphone charger.
  - Closets/storage: Do they exist?
  - Appliances.
  - Accessibility: Can your furniture logically get up the stairs and into the apartment?
  - Pets.
  - Paint. Can you paint the walls?
- Be a good tenant. 90% of this is paying your rent on time, but also be sure to alert landlords right away when there is a problem.
- Learn how to patch nail holes.
- If you need to match paint, chip off a pain sample so they can scan and match shade perfectly.
- Bare minimum:
  - Kitchen: A small table and 2 chairs.
  - Living room: A couch, bookcase or shelving, and a coffee table. Then: desk, love seat, chair, side tables, something to set up the TV in.
  - Bedroom: A bed, nightstand, and a dresser, vanity.
  - Bathroom: Storage option.
- How to decorate
  - Match your closet. Whatever you like as a person, you'll like it in home decor. Start off with an object that you really like. Whenever she wanted to add something to her room, it must match the object. Painting just one wall makes a large difference.
- Frames, not posters. Art is something else that you can slowly but surely acquire. It doesn't have to be insanely expensive, but treat them right, and get them framed.
- Get an actual bed. Mattress stores are weirdly into haggling, so start by really low-balling them.
- Correspondence drawer: something that will allow you to send a letter or a check immediately.
- Buy tools.
  - Hammer.
  - Adjustable screwdriver.
  - Crescent wrench.
  - Tape measure.
  - Cordless drill.
- Keys: One to a friend and one somewhere near your house, but is hidden.
- If you are really terrible at cleaning, it may be worth it to hire a cleaner, and ask if they can tutor you while they clean.
- Do some cleaning daily. Dishes, hang up your clothes, put others in the laundry.
- Make your bed every morning. It's way nice to get into a made bed. The longest sheets should go without washing is two weeks; wash them in warm water by themselves, using half the usual amount of detergent.
- When to mindlessly tidy:
  - While on the phone.
  - When having something while cooking.
  - While waiting for the bath to fill or the shower water to heat.
- Garbage--leftover, crusty food is not made into anything except compost.

#### Bucket List

- Dawn dish soap.
- Broom and dustpan.
- Mop.
- Bucket.
- Paper towels.
- Rags.
- A scrubber.
- A toothbrush for little crevices.
- Bleach, but always have gloves on while.
- Cheap white vinegar--one part vinegar to two parts hot water is a wonderful glass cleaner.
- Spray bleach solution.
- Knee pads to make scrubbing easier.

#### Weekly Cleaning

- Clean your bathroom.
- Do your laundry, including bed linens.
- Sweep and mop non-carpet surfaces.
- Check corners for cobwebs.
- Wipe down surfaces. Wet rag and dry rag.
- If you have a pet, think about vacuuming.
- Bleach your sink, tub, and toilet. Fill them with hot water, and perhaps half a cup of bleach to a tub or between an eighth and a quarter cup to a sink, then let it sit for twenty minutes. After you've drained and rinsed, any remaining grime is super easy to get off.
- *Do not keep things in your house that make you feel sad or bad.*
- Things that live in the same room can and should go in boxes together.
- Wrap fragile items with newspaper (more than seems reasonable) then seal with a little bit of tape.
- If a larger item needs a smaller item to function, tape them together (TV remotes to TVs, IKEA furniture to its screws.)
- Soft tings to in big garbage bags which you can toss.

## Cooking

- Medium-size saucepan, a large saucepan, a large frying pan, and a griddle. Knives--really where you should spend some cash. Get a chef's knife and a sharpener. Paring, bread knife.
- Six big plates, six little plates, six bowls, six glasses, six forks, six butter knives, six spoons, six pint glasses, and six wineglasses.
- Can opener
- Spatula
- Ladle
- Wooden spoons
- Salt/pepper shakers
- Whisk
- Measuring cups/spoons
- Colander
- Corkscrew
- Vegetable peeler
- Box grater
- Roasting pan
- Dutch oven
- Toaster
- Food processor
- Rolling pin
- Handheld juicer

### Ingredients

- Black/pinto beans, brown/white rice, lentils, oatmeal, pasta, cereal, wheat bread.
- Olive oil, butter, bacon fat.
- Flour, sugar, honey, vanilla extract, baking powder, baking soda, cranberries.
- Balsamic vinegar, white wine vinegar, parsley, onions, garlic, ketchup, mayo hot sauce, soy sauce, thyme dill, oregano, basil.
- Milk, eggs, potatoes, onions, apples, fruit and veggies for snacking.

- Air is the enemy when it comes to storing or freezing leftovers. Get all possible air out before it goes in the freezer.
- Meat should be put in the freezer within 2 days.

### Cooking

- Baking. Oven. Warm dry heat rises from the bottom. Dry heat.
- Boiling. Submerging an item in water or stock that is boiling. Poaching = happens in hot but not super-hot water, bubbles shouldn't be showing. Simmering: tiny bubbles are forming continuously on the bottom. Rolling boil involves the whole surface of the water moving as one. Boil is calmer, involves constant bubbles the size of the tip of your pinkie.
- Braising. Partially covering the item with liquid (might be beef stock or red wine) then putting a lid on the pot so it is sort of both poached and steamed.
- Broiling. Top of the oven, very fat.
- Frying. Enough fat is put in a pan to cover the bottom, then the item is placed in the hot fat. This is a great way to start meat that will be baked, as it gives it that crispy delicious exterior. *Don't put too much of anything in at once when you're frying. When things are fried, they're generally giving off moisture.*
- Sauteing. On a pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Turn the element on, then add some fat and let is spread out.
