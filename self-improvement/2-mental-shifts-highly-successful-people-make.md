## The 2 Mental Shifts Highly Successful People Make
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/the-2-mental-shifts-every-highly-successful-person-makes-c757ead99a99#.fibi54qi2)

- First shift: The power of choice and individual responsibility.
- Once you make this shift, you are empowered to pull yourself from the poverty of time, finances, and relationships.
- When a musician starts out, they write music for the love of it. Problem is, if they become successful, they may:
  - Focus shifts from why they're writing music to what their music has brought them. Consequently, they are either satisfied with their results and no longer have the drive to write more.
  - They become a perfectionist/paralyzed.
- Elizabeth Gilbert: Forced herself to fail a few times, just to get it out of her system.

#### Shift 1: The Power of Choice

**"If it is to be, it is up to me."**

- Stop playing the victim to external circumstances and take responsibility for your life.
- You are responsible for how you respond to life. No longer do you impulsively react. No longer do you blame others for any lack on your part.
- Same with leadership. Negative outcome of a team operation fall square on the leader. Positive outcomes  are awarded to the team.
- **Self-leadership: If something doesn't work out, blame yourself. If you don't, you'll remain hostage to things out of your control.**
- "We control our actions, but the consequences that flow from those actions are controlled by principles."
- The only way to avoid negative consequences is to understand the principles governing natural consequences (whut).
- Hence, highly successful people are continually learning and striving to better understand the world around them. **You can't be free to act if you don't understand the consequences of your behavior.**
- **Realize that every choice will yield an outcome, then you can decide which outcomes you want.** No choice is free. Every choice is tied to an outcome. Thus, every choice has meaning.
- TIME is the final consequence/cost of every choice. You can't get your time back. You can course correct/learn from past mistakes. You can solve problems. But there is always a cost.

#### Success and Happiness is a Choice

- **Confidence doesn't lead to high performance. Rather, confidence is a bi-product of previous performance.**
- Starting your day well means you are likely to have confidence throughout the rest of your day. If you start poorly, that prior performance will sap your confidence, even subconsciously.
- **Confidence is a direct reflection of past performance. Hence, yesterday is more important than today. Luckily, today is tomorrow's yesterday. So even if your confidence today isn't optimal, your confidence tomorrow is still within your control.**
- If you want to be confident, that's up to you. If you want to be happy, that's up to you. If you want to be successful, that's up to you.

#### Momentum is Essential

- Consistency is key to developing momentum. You get it by putting intentional effort towards a singular goal or vision, and eventually the compound effect takes over.
- **If you take complete responsibility for your life and choices, you will develop a love for learning. You'll come to understand and live principles which will organically facilitate success in your life.**
- Problem with organizations: "Stage 3" culture, where everyone is out for themselves. Goal is competition, not collaboration.

#### Problem for Successful People Who Have Made the First Shift

- Always about them
- They become satisfied and distracted by their success
- Perfectionism
- Over-attachment to their success/perceived identity
- Become obsessed with constant affirmation from themselves and others, and stop seeking genuine feedback
- They don't learn how to work well with others
- They think their way is the "right" way
- They can't trust other people enough to delegate or collaborate

## Shift 2: The Power of Context

- Many successful people stop being a student. **When you are a student, you actively seek to have your paradigm shattered. You want to be wrong and you want feedback. You care more about learning than what other people think about you.**
- Covey Private Victory:
  - Be proactive
  - Begin with the end in mind
  - Put first things first
- "Public Victory"
  - Think win-win
  - Seek first to understand, then be understood
  - Synergize
- 10x Thinking: Tim Ferriss.  "For purposes of illustration here, I might reword [Thiel’s question] to: ‘What might you do to accomplish your 10-year goals in the next 6 months, if you had a gun against you head?’ Now, let’s pause. Do I expect you to take 10 seconds to ponder this and then magically accomplish 10 years’ worth of dreams in the next few months? No, I don’t. But I do expect that the question will productivity break your mind, like a butterfly shattering a chrysalis to emerge with new capabilities. The ‘normal’ systems you have in place, the social rules you've forced upon yourself, the standard frameworks — they don’t work when asking a question like this. You are forced to shed artificial constraints, like shedding a skin, to realize that you had the ability to renegotiate your reality all along.”"
- Delegate everything but genius.
- Higher order principle is collaborating with others who are far advanced of your current level. Exercise with people in far better shape. Work with more talented people than you. Date or marry someone "up".
- The shift: "You are responsible for more than just yourself."

#### Rest and Recovery

- Federer and Lebron have said they sleep an average of 12 hours per day.
- Recent study: Constant smartphone use stops people from properly recovering from work/life. *They are always "on" to distraction and connection. They never disconnect.*
