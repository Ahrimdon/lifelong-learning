## Should You Listen to Your Parents?

I gave in to my parents was I had self-doubt. It is really important in life to have a job and support yourself. Job security, I was working on my Plan B first. Life always takes you in a direction that you don't expect. I went to Sydney to study film but I took the PhD and I just wanted to combine film and physics.

The future is not monolithic, you don't have some giant neverending fixed thing which is unitary in its description. Our futures are a big mix and we pick out the things we want to put in our mix.

## Why Are Revolutionary Scientists Young?

- Newton: 1666. 22 years old.
- Albert Einstein: Discovered most shit by 26.
- Darwin: Before 30 he thought of Evolution. Published it on 50.

- Intellectual capacity stronger when young?
- Less responsibility when younger?
- More motivation (Stephen Hawking wanted money for his wife)
- All are important but the most important is that a young scientist is not cluttered with knowledge.

> It's not what you don't know that gets you in trouble, it's what you know for sure that just ain't so.

- Once your mind becomes certain about stuff, it's hard to break free. It's okay to be focused at some points but revolutionary impacts need you to think laterally.
- Think of "maybe the second is not actually one second for everyone?" Or "how does it make sense that a creator created this, and is it not more plausible that these species came from one species?"
- More baggage = harder to think of new shit.
- If you don't know what's normal then you don't know what is really abnormal. So you let your mind wander there.

Not all breakthroughs are given by young scientists. But how do you make a contribution when your brain is in decline? You can get more perspective when your brain begins to chunk things together.

When you're learning something you need a lot of thought doing it. Over time you learn to do things automatically, without thinking. Think working memory. What you want to do is to automate parts of your brain so you don't have to chunk stuff.

Muscle memory is ridiculous because the memory is in your brain but it feels like it because you've done it so many times. You have to think of things a lot of times to get things right.
