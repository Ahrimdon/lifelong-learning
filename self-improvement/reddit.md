## [What harsh truths have you learned as you have grown and aged?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1tz33j/what_harsh_truths_have_you_learned_as_you_have/)

#### No one's coming. It's you. You have to make your own life, your own luck, your future. Don't wait for life to happen to you, you have to go out there and make it happen for yourself.

And don't be deterred by setbacks and failures. It's not how good you are at avoiding mistakes, it's how good you are when faced with adversity.

You never grow in jolly good times -- only when you're shoveling crap.

I learned the hard way (from negative consequences) not to lie, not to gossip, not to mess around with married men, not to drink alcohol to excess. I learned that fighting for what is right is worth the price, that doing what is right is the only way to live with integrity and that integrity is everything. I learned that to believe in success ensures success -- you can make anything happen by believing that it will be achieved. I learned that no matter how bad things appear to be, (which for me included deceased children, husbands, family, friends) that good will come from it in some unexpected way.

I've been doing Test Driven Development (TDD) for the last year, which is a coding practice that has you first write some code that tries to use a feature you've not yet created, then run it to make sure it doesn't accidentally work (once in awhile it will, and you'll realize you wrote it wrong, or already implemented the feature and forgot), then write just enough production code to make the test pass, without breaking any of your other tests. There are a whole host of benefits to continually creating tests in this way, but one of them, apropos to this topic, is that you start every new feature by failing, because you must prove your test fails first, or you wont recognize when you've transitioned to it succeeding.

Because this becomes an intrinsic part of every single thing you do, you quickly become completely immune to failing. You're always failing. Failing is normal. When something actually fails, it's hard to care. That's normal. You just fix it and move on. Also, the constantly writing code to make your tests pass makes you really good at diving in and fixing non-working things. That's your default way of being under TDD. You are the person who constantly creates problems, then fixes them. If something else creates a problem, it's no problem. You can forgo the first part - creating the problem - and simply jump in and fix it. I've had moments where a problem cropped up, and it was a relief that it wasn't one I created. "Oh, good. A problem I didn't have to create first. Half the work is already done for me on this one." Now when I hear coworkers who don't do TDD sigh and say "this isn't working," I think "So?"

"A ship is safe in harbor but that's not what ships are for."

I think, though, you have to always take accountability for your relationships and never give yourself the luxury of feeling like a victim. If people have tread upon you, shame on them, but feeling victimized just encourages you to sit around and feel sorry for yourself. You just dig deeper into your problems.
Instead, you can tell yourself "I never stood up for myself, so people are naturally treating me this way. No point in blaming them; I must learn to get better at standing up for myself." That kind of attitude puts you into the position for real growth. And in a sense, it's absolutely true: you are constantly training people how to treat you. If people routinely treat you like shit, the problem is you've been bad at training them.
I'm not trying to pretend I know about your specific situation, but just reflecting in general.

We have to also moderate how much we give, and how responsibly we set our boundaries. Even with those we love, and with those that love us the most. I used to struggle so terribly with people that would ask things of me, but only because I was the one that had a problem with saying no. Once I learned how to say no, how to rely on the ability of others to do the same and finally, how to read when people weren't being forthright with me and were getting worn out by me because they weren't setting healthy boundaries, all of my personal relationships improved.

#### The world doesn't care if you are hurting or broken. It will run over you without blinking.

"The world isn't against you my dear... it just doesn't care"

Reminds me of a line by Agatha Christie.. "Trouble should be easier to handle as we are older, but by then we know that world is not cruel, only indifferent, and that hurts even more."

“The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent, but if we can come to terms with this indifference, then our existence as a species can have genuine meaning. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.” ― Stanley Kubrick

"Well, I hate to break it to you, but there is no big lie. There is no system. The universe is indifferent."

"Life will punch you in the face, wait for you to get back up so it can kick you in the stomach, but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they love the taste of air." -Sarah Kay

Alain de bottom talks about the problem of a metitocracy (holy shit totally am blanking out on spelling) has on happiness and reality. He says basically our society has come to believe we make our own destinity and because we really cant a lot of ppl turn the blame inward. 90 % of the things that happen our out of our control and we shouldnt be deluded to think that positive thinking or laws of attraction are going to move planets and stars in our favor.

We all have or will suffer greatly. The question why me is an understandable one. The answer is.. why not you? Why should anyone be free from suffering? The fact that we all suffer is proof that the world is just. When I suffer (And I am on top of my shit) I try to remember that I am paying off a karmic debt. It doesn't hurt as bad.

As far as making our own luck... it's not as black and white. Why do inocent children fall ill? I do not know. I do however know that my Grandmother was given six months to live (lung cancer). She has been ill for two and a half years now. Soon she will be gone. I can not describe how greatful we are that she ate well, did not drink or smoke (I'm no angel), and exercised regularly.

Picking yourself up and being kicked back down... man has been asking this question since the beginning. The Book of Job is all about this. I find it to be B.S. but hey.. at least it isn't an apithetic exploration of the idea.

"Falling down is a part of life. Getting back up is living"

As a Cancer Survivor, this is the motto I live by... "Cancer couldn't kill me. You don't stand a chance."

I especially love the bumper stickers that say, "if anything can go well, it will" or "life is good" always makes think of the guy who's wife left him for his friend and the lady who found out she has cancer.

As children, we believe the world exists to provide for us. As we get older we superficially discard that belief, but a part of us still clings to it. We feel that we are entitled to have others help and protect us.

However, that is unfortunately not how the world works. Most people are fundamentally only concerned with what value you can provide for them. This applies to people who you think are your friends: how quickly they leave when you go a long stretch of not being any fun to hang out with.

Most people are only nice to you, realistically speaking, because you have a certain status in the world. Try acting super low status: many people who used to be nice will start treating you like shit.

You can be sad about it and blame other people as weak and shallow, but that accomplishes nothing. You just have to acknowledge the truth, Be strong, and realize the only people who will truly be there through thick and thin for you are people who share your own genes - if you're lucky enough to be close to your family. But it is what it is.

The trouble with depression - and I speak from experience here - is that it makes you look like a self-absorbed prick.

If you get chickenpox then you break out in spots, and everyone understands it - you're still you, just a bit itchier and with spots all over you.

When someone gets seriously depressed (to the point they can no longer function) they break out in sadness, self-absorbtion and generally being trying and frustrating to be around. The trouble is that unlike spots - where you're the same person and only the surface has changed - with depression often who you are changes. You aren't you any more... at least unless "you" was always an apathetic, miserable person wrapped up in their own head and who frequently lets down their friends or makes little effort to keep in contact with them.

If you have spots and you're an a relationship where looks are important (say, a celebrity spokesperson or model) then it's up to you to cover them up or otherwise manage them, or its understandable if the relationship breaks down or ends. Friendships are relationships based on personalities and behaviour, so if one party's personality and/or behaviour changes radically, it seems the height of self-entitlement to demand the relationship continues unaffected.

I don't mean to round down on anyone - especially anyone who's depressed, but I've seen serious depression up close and personal, both from the inside and the outside, and this common "oh man, I got depressed and lost many of my friends; oh well I guess they weren't real friends anyway" is sometimes true but often deeply unfair.

The fact is that they were friends with a person, and then that person changed personality. They stopped being the person they were friends with, and gradually turned into a different one - a boring, self-obsessed one who lets them down all the time - apparently because they're too lazy or simply don't care enough not to - and shits up any social gathering by being miserable to those around them.

TL;DR: No-one owes us friendship, and certainly not irrespective of our behaviour to others, or regardless of how our personality changes. Ideally they would understand that it's due to the illness and would try to cut us some slack, but realistically most depressed people I've known understand very little about the causes and mechanisms of depression, so you can't fairly blame people who don't even have it for not understanding it better.

True friendship is generally shared with 2-5 people tops though, thats the issue is that a lot of people believe they have more true friends than that. Which is ridiculous, because you can't give so much of your own time to more people than that, especially if you are close to your own family to stay close with, or need to provide for your own spouse and children. True friendship is extremely limited, lets be sure to define it as maybe 2 true friend in our lives. More than that is a rarity.

I used to feel this way too because I'd been so hurt and I looked at the world through a cynical and jaded lens. With the help of Martin Seligman's book on 'Learned Optimism' (he's the founder of the Positive Psychology movement), I learned (eventually!) to see the world through a new lens.
A lens I chose, a lens that didn't mean helplessness and negativity. And the same life...that hadn't changed on the outside...changed completely for me! :O It was like some kind of miracle. I was SHOCKED.
People became warm and friendly. And very helpful. Life was beautiful as well as painful. Life was worth living.
Perspective is more powerful than any drug. Our beliefs create our world.

My best friend has been the most intimate relationship of my life. She has been my dearest friend for thirty years. The quality of our relationship puts the average marriage to shame in terms of friendship. However, if my dominant life habits were suddenly not life affirming for her, she would have to put distance between us. Life is harsh and all of us put great effort into just facing what we must face. Friendships exists because it helps those involved. When it ceases to be useful, it is not a bad thing for friendship to breakdown.

Dude, you break up with your fiancee, you owe her a fucking explanation. The cops won't take you to jail if you don't, so aside from social stigma, you'll walk away relatively easily.
But we are living in a society, here. You are deluded if you think you owe her nothing.

80% of friendship is how people feel when they are with you. Hence beautiful and wealthy people have a lot of friends. Is it because of their fabulous personalities? No. Its because others feel good being connected to beauty, money. I feel better when my friends are 'winners' by societies standards. They may be adulterers, they may do drugs, they may be liars, but if they are beautiful and wealthy then who cares? Its true. And if you don't believe me, then you are still a teenager who has not experienced much of life.

I actually just learned this this very month. It's good to know. Though I would add this to it:
The world doesn't care if you are hurting or broken. It will run over you without blinking.

I actually just learned this this very month. It's good to know. Though I would add this to it:

Yet that should never be a reason to ignore the hurting and broken when you can do something to help.

#### Reasonable minds can differ. Seriously, there are very smart, well-reasoned people who disagree with almost every opinion and belief you have, and that's okay.

The votes system is as good or bad (for me) as the voters' demographics.

This has been a big thing for me to overcome in my mid-20s. I feel like certain beliefs I hold very close to me define me and if someone has different views than they have something against me.

#### There's no speed limit on anything (in the metaphorical sense). Graduate at 30? Sure. First kiss at 12? Sure. Divorce at 21? Why not. PhD at 21? Go for it. A lot of walls exist, and there are walls we can never break down, but some of those walls are walls you build. You have the plans, just knock those down.

This is my favorite. Often we see the world as a well organized performance that we get to play a part in once we graduate. No, we're already playing the part we create.

Color outside the lines.

So many people have this idea of "how they're supposed to live," and constantly compare themselves to others.
I saw a quote on here a while back that said something like "the reason we struggle with insecurity is that we compare our behind the scenes moments to someone else's highlight reel."
Life is too fucking short. Find your own way and don't apologize to anyone.

As someone who will just graduated from middle school at 16 and will graduate from high school at 20 and have been feeling depressed about it ever since i was 14. This makes me feel better.

As someone who dropped out of university after being promised the world in high school, it was a dark few years coming to terms with the fact I'm going to be outstripped by a lot of my peers. But once you realize the standard you are regulated by is the one you set, you realize its not a race, you only have yourself to answer to: its a liberating feeling. I hope you get yourself checked out for depression if you are feeling like its a serious, clincal problem; I myself am just a stranger on the internet, but I think you've got a interesting story to tell, you just haven't written it yet.

Character trumps everything. If you're failing, make sure that you're building something else.

Afterwards, World of Warcraft was released and I played the shit out of it. Since I didn't care for anything but PvE (Player vs. Environment), I quickly became involved in large and diversified groups of players. I ended up in a leader position, which is something that I had never experienced until then. I had international contacts every day, so it gave me an opportunity to improve my English skills. I learned a LOT about communication, strictness, planning, resource management, team building, and mainly self improvement. Retrospectively, there are a lot of things I would have handled differently if I had known what I know now.

Fuck everyone else.
It's your life.
Run your own race at your own pace.
The only thing you should focus on is improving your personal best.
Be happy with yourself and try a little bit harder every day. Just a little bit each day, makes a HUGE difference over your lifetime. :)

I can relate some to you. While I didn't graduate high school late I dd take quite some time off from college once I figured out I really didn't know what I wanted to do.

I have since returned to college and will be graduating at 26. I have been recruited and offered a job after graduating from the top firm in my field and usually run circles around most college students while also working full time. Fact is that I am much more mature now than most college students are and I have a greater appreciation for my education and professional achievements.

Word of advice. What ever you do, whether its college or work after high school, do your absolute best. Life is too short to regret being mediocre. You will slowly develop pride in your accomplishments that is what feeds success. PRIDE IN YOUR WORK.

The most successful people in the world are the ones who don't see these walls.

As someone who graduated high school at 30 I couldn't agree more. Many of my barriers were self-created and it took me longer than most to realize that. I am now happily on my way to earning my BSN.

Some things will just never happen, I agree. But there are some things that we inhibit ourselves from, and its the ones we can change. Something about discretion is the better part of valor: knowing which hills I'm willing to die on and which battles are worth fighting. I'm no expert, lol.

#### Sometimes love alone just isn't enough. You can be in a loving relationship with someone, but if the timing is wrong/you aren't on the same page in life, sometimes it just doesn't work no matter how much you love one another.

This is something that occurred to me today as I go through a break up process. People would like to think that love is a cure-all for relationship issues, but sometimes circumstance/timing have to dictate what you do.

In a lot of ways, love makes it all harder and more complicated. I've wanted to unlove someone before, because it would make the right decision easier. I've always felt that relationships are a choice, but love generally isn't. And that's a bitch.

Adding to your list of things that no amount of love can do:
Pay the bills.
Make a person love themself.

You HAVE to love your partner. That's totally given. But if you ONLY love them you're missing 90% of the equation.
I love my husband. A shit ton. But more importantly I respect, admire, empathize, like, sympathize, agree with, and understand him.

Adding to this: you can't change people. You can be with someone for years, and you can love them, and it can be a bad relationship which isn't worth being in. This seems like a stupid concept, but it's true - you can love the wrong person, and your love of them can blind you to how wrong they are for you. Eventually, you'll get used to not being loved the way you want and need, and you'll begin to settle for the good times, and count on those. 

I loved a guy in an opposites attract sort of way. But eventually, what I first saw as "constructive criticism" became judgement. Judgement became snider and crueler, until it was eventually almost apathetic. Don't love someone you don't feel you can rely on. Don't love someone who'll turn their phone off on you when you're upset, because they'll "deal with it later when it's more convenient." Don't love someone who sits and stares at you when you cry, and the next words out of their mouth aren't kind, but more of that judgement you've come to expect. Don't love someone you fear.

To clarify I dislike the coldness, not the people, I refuse to be a sink on someone rather than a source of happiness to them. By being like this will I change anything? I can only hope so for at least a few people, probability dictates otherwise but I've never cared much for numbers anyways. I've learned in my short time on this earth that the nice guy always gets stepped on, it is for this reason that I choose to be just that as I would rather be stepped on than do so to an innocent stranger. In short, I refuse to be a certain way just because it is useful in society. I think there's value in loving people, even those who will tread on you and even if you can't make a person love themselves you can help them rebuild their life and give them an opportunity to try.

Went through a bad relationship a while back. It was long and coming for miles, but I can only see this now, much later. We loved each other and thought that would suffice, but it didn't. She was on a completely different page in life, and while I was ready to settle down and be with one person, the thought scared her immensely, even though she was about the same age as me. It was one of those doomed to fail things, and after a while, months before we actually broke up, I think we both realised that and we were just clutching to love.

#### "You would worry less about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do"

This is freeing! Man, nobody cares if I look awesome today or if I look shit. Nobody cares what I do. Nobody will ever care about me as much as I care about myself - they're the stars in their own show, not me.

The more you understand this the more you can a) not stress the little things and b) work to make yourself an important and relevant part of the lives of those you do want to be important and relevant to.

Think of all of the people you've admired in your life. Think of the carefree sorts, and how you wish you could be like them. Think of the "cool" people, who never seem to worry, and do whatever they want without fear. Isn't it that confidence you find attractive? There are studies - too many of them - that show that people find confidence to be hugely attractive. This doesn't have to be real, though. Imagine that confident person you wished you could be like getting home, shutting their door, and collapsing in tears on the floor, because they were faking it the whole time, and inside they're a wreck like everyone else. It didn't matter to you. You just saw what you loved - confidence.

Simply "act" like a confident person, and don't worry that you aren't. You're inhabiting a role. Try it on, and watch other people react. You'll start to see people seeing you the way you see other confident people. Do this for awhile - and don't care that you're faking it - and you will likely develop real confidence, because the world around you will support that notion, because that's who you told it you are. Tell the world who you are with your actions, watch it change around you in response to that, and then watch yourself change in response to that into actually being what you were pretending to be all along. Then believe you are what you just created, because you were indeed the agent of its design, and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps - however you do it - is exactly what confident people do.



There's a distinction to make here first, and that is people who are in your life and people who are not. People who don't know you or don't know you well will rarely give a shit about you so worrying about what they think is pointless.

People who are in your life and/or are important to you (relationship partners, friends, colleagues and superiors) are the only people whose opinion it is worth caring about. And even then we usually assume they care/notice a lot more than they actually do.

Basically, don't sweat the small stuff. It's almost always not worth it.

Think about the last time you went out, and try to recall everyone you talked to, and then everyone you saw. Think about what you noticed about them, and what you remember. That should give you a better perspective on what people notice and remember about you - generally, it's fuck all.

I think people often do that only in relation to themselves. ie Will I look cool by hanging around with him? They don't give it too much thought either. Besides, you don't want to hang around superficial people.

The other day a random group of strangers to me were discussing me with a mutual friend, who updated me on this conversation. Random strangers, who I would not know the first names of knew my relationship status and more generally who I was. Superficially, people think of you as often as you question the pairing of green jeans with purple shoes - 'what are those Barney's legs?'

I stopped giving a shit years ago when I hit college... realized no one really cares as much about myself as I thought. I started wearing what I wanted, doing what I wanted, and allowed myself to grow and be myself. People call me selfish when I say that I only have myself, my work, and my family to look after, but how many other people really matter to me? My wife and child are my world, and my line of work is my passion. Those two things are what make ME. As far as I am concerned, everything else doesn't matter.

Slowly learning this one (and still working on it at 29 years old) has been the BEST THING for me. I've suffered for as long as I can remember with paranoia and anxiety that varies from 'meh' to 'sitting on floor sobbing because I have to go to the supermarket'.

In the last year I've really pushed myself to grow and to change the way I look at the world and more importantly how I look at other people. Your quote is exactly what I try to tell myself all the time. It's not my job to impress people or spend my time terrified of what they think of me, because honestly they just don't.

And from these things that I can't help but notice, I make decisions about whether or not I would want to interact with someone. I mean, most people I see out and about like at walmart for example I will never talk to, simply because I have no reason to. But let's say I did have a reason. Let's say that you're a girl and I'm looking for a girlfriend. If you are overweight, unkempt, or taller than me, my mind has already ruled you out as a potential mate.

I feel like you SHOULD care what people think about you if you want something from people. Don't go out looking like crap if you want to meet someone, unless of course you want to meet someone who also likes to look like crap. It seems like a common sense thing. Your self-worth as a person isn't determined by the clothes you wear your how much you weigh, but the quality of your life can be, and your interactions with other people most certainly will be as well.

In terms of being successful in life I think it's pretty obvious that being in shape and dressing well will help go forward. But if you're happy being overweight and unkempt, who gives a shit what other people think? If you have a million dollars in the bank, why do you care if someone doesn't like how you dress? And if you're a normal person, nobody notices that you're wearing the same shirt today so get over it.

Anyway I asked her how she could be so happy in such a terrible place and she said "I just don't give a fuck what people think of me." I realized over the summer that it was true. Why should I care what some bitches think of the way I dress or that I like to read and watch science fiction. At least I wasn't a bitch. At least I was true to myself and what I think of my life is ultimately what matters.

Unfortunately, I think the real harsh truth is that people make snap judgements of you without really looking at what you do or who you are. People don't think much of others, but they will store what quick thoughts they had initially and keep that shit forever. It's really hard to undo that stuff.

If you want women to look at you as desirable boyfriend material, you're going to have to groom your looks and shower and put on some nice clothes instead of your baggy tshirt and sweatpants that you would wear if you thought "nobody cares if I look like shit." Stop saying bullshit like this because wearing the same clothes and having the same grooming you had since you were 11 just makes you look like an overgrown 6th-grade boy, and women DO care if you look like an overgrown 6th-grade boy and will not want to date you.

My point is not to stress the small stuff because nobody notices, and not to stress things that aren't going to be noticed by people who are relevant and important in your life. A handy hint is that people tend not to notice nearly as much as we think, so, for example, if you woke up in a hurry and threw on yesterday's shirt your boss probably won't notice so quit stressing.

remember that the people who love you think about you constantly, whether it's friends, family, or even your bloody dog, you mean the world to them, no matter who you are you have someone who's life would be worse off without you.

What helped me in my depression earlier in life was knowing how much I would hurt loved ones by doing something stupid, large parts of their lives wasted, lost, made less than meaningless in raising and nurturing me.

It is more about waking up the morning after a massive night out on the booze with "The Fear". You start thinking about all the stupid things you did and how embarassing it is now. Truth is, everyone else thinking the same thing, what stupid things they did. Basically everyone to concerned thinking about the things they did rather than what you did.

#### At some point you get old, and what makes you old will be unique to you. You don't know when it's going to happen or what you'll look like when it does finally happen, but it will happen. I'm 27 and FUCK, I am old. I have a full time job, a wife, a kid, a car payment, etc. But that doesn't make me old.

What makes me old is the understanding that my family relies on me for just about everything. My wife would never admit it, but my mood alters hers a lot. I can tell that when I moan and groan for a few minutes about work, it kills her - she doesn't like it if I had a rough day. She's a reasonable person and wants my day to go well! So, I suck it up and tell her the truth; either that my day was great, or that it had a few rough patches but I got through it and will be better for having had the experience.

My father is getting old and will, sometime in the next 5 years, be retired. I know that if something goes wrong, I will be financially responsible for him. I have no siblings.

My daughter relies on me for love, compassion, knowledge, and understanding. She relies on me as a father figure, or just someone to have a tea party with. She'll need me as a stable figure in her life in order for her to be a success over the long haul.

My students rely on my every day to be a facilitator of science education in the classroom. For many, I am the only person they can count on to show up every day and I'm the only adult in their lives they can talk to without getting shouted at.

I feel like you are future me - its almost terrifying. I have hit the point that I am old, mentally speaking, despite being 23. I am the first of my closest friends to get married, graduate, get a house, car, salaried position doing what I love, and now a child. Only one of the friends gets close - graduating.

My wife is my best friend and is the most stable ground I can rely on - without her, I am nothing. Like you, our moods alter each other subtly, so we just keep things as natural as we can. We never fight because there is nothing to fight about - not even disagreements. We learned that arguments are best solved before going to sleep because you never know if you can take anything back. As such, we have learned that there is not a lot worth arguing about in the world - money can be had, things can be fixed and replaced, and bones can mended. We have been together for 5 years and have been getting stronger every day - I truly love her more than ever and make sure she knows it. I am at the point where I am terrified to think of anything happening to either of us - we are each other's everything. She says she wants to die first because she will be lost without me and will never remarry, but she doesn't realize how much she means to me... again, without her, I am nothing - I cannot be the person I love being without loving her. When that time comes in our lives, I honestly don't know...

You're clearly not an English teacher. This isn't why you're old -- this is why you're responsible. And that's a beautiful, wonderful thing. So many people aren't, and don't care about what happens to the people who rely upon them. That said, as Mark Twain once said, the difference between the right word and the wrong word is like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.
You're old because your hangovers can last more than one day--not because you don't bother to get hung over anymore because that'd be irresponsible. Believe it or not, oldness is not a linear function of responsibility.

#### You only spend your whole life with one person, which is yourself. If you don't like yourself, you will have an issue.

#### It doesn't matter how smart you think you are if you do not apply yourself. Don't be lazy, you will never be as happy as you could be otherwise.

I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.

"Lazy" in programmer's lingo means "tends to automate as much as possible instead of jumping in an plowing through a task with brute force".

All of the programmers who work for me work from home offices. I don't know or care when they work. They get it done on time. And they are awesome.

The idea of the smart slacker is a lie. They still have to work for their intelligence. Generally, when I see someone characterized as a smart slacker their motivation isn't money or they have developed a characteristic/viewpoint that inhibits their success.

People with limited talent but end up financially successful are usually focused on money. That's just where their effort goes. They may appear to lack talent but have focused all of their talents into making money. Similarly, I've met a lot of lazy and talentless people who are successful on a fluke but would never admit it.

This is why Forrest Gump is so fantastic. He just does. Running, or mowing, helping, etc. He is always moving.

"Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."

#### "Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time."

"Money circulates; time is spent."

Higher paying jobs require instense education.
These jobs usually require you to do work off the clock in order to complete a project.
The higher paying jobs are stressful usually.
Higher paying jobs require you to educate yourself constantly to keep your knowledge of your career relevant so you can compete with the new graduates that have more up to date knowledge.
ALL this requires time because money doesn't grow on trees.

I work as an engineer for a manufacturing company. Yes, my degree cost a lot of money, and I have to spend a lot of my time learning (which I actually put in the benefits column). But compared to the guys who work in our shop, I work on average 5-10 fewer hours per week, at twice the rate a guy who had spent those same four years working here would get.

Go into sales. Anyone can do it, just takes confidence and something to sell. Look at Bieber, you think he's worried about his education? Nope, sales.

#### You are not special and are very much replaceable.

To some people I am not. My mother, my son, my husband.

I'm not sure you understand grief and loss.
That hole you speak of, isn't ever filled back in. You just learn to accept it over time. You still know the hole is there, you think about it - whether on purpose or randomly- you can try to avoid it but sometimes you're going to fall in.

Exactly. You don't replace loved ones. Moving on means learning to cope, not forgetting.

You may have a new relationship, but it doesn't change the fact you once had. It's a new relationship, not a replacement. If you try to treat it as a replacement the marriage isn't going to last long.

People are not interchangeable. Some people mean more to you than others. One does not replace the other even of your relationship with someone else changes. It can be hard to explain this, but it is true. If you could truly replace people then loss wouldn't hurt so much because you would just replace that person. You may have more friends and loved ones, but you never get that specific person back. I've lost enough people to habe learned this.
For example, I love my daughter more than I can say. I wouldn't trade her for the world. That said, my love for her doesn't replace that of her older sister who died six days after birth. I love them both, one as much as the other, but the love doesn't replace the loss. I am having another little girl on July. I will love her as much as my other two. No more no less. She won't be replacing anyone or anything.

This is depressing but true. Everybody's the star of their own life who thinks they're irreplaceable and special but in reality there is always a person more hardworking, more deserving, and just more talented than you.

You can be irreplaceable and special, but it takes work. You think you were born with something superior to everybody else? Fucking prove it. You think you're smarter than everybody else? Get a 4.0 or go to med school. Oh, those aren't fair assessments of intelligence? What the fuck is the value of your "superior" intelligence if it doesn't increase your value in a practical, real world field?

Nearly everybody I converse with on this website falls into probably the upper 10% of human intellect. I can tell, just by their articulation and ability to process and share ideas. Chances are if you're reading this you're smarter than the next eight people you talk to today.

Guess what? It's not worth a fucking thing. Get off your ass. Study. Work. Make a fucking contribution to the human race. Yeah, you're smart as shit. We know. But you aren't owed a goddamn thing except what you earn.

#### You won't ever reach an age where you will have things figured out completely.
The upside is that there is nothing to wait for; you are as qualified as you are going to get, and as confident as you let yourself be.

This puts things into perspective for me. As someone who has been educated and trained for a certain profession, I've been terrified of entering the field and finally doing it on my own. I always feel like I need more practice and the responsibility scares me.

I have worked for several very large companies, and I can tell you with complete confidence that almost everyone at every one of them had no idea what they were doing, ever. You'll be fine. Just be courteous, alert, adaptable, and go with the flow, and everyone will like you and think you belong there. Also, messing up is okay. You learn far more from your mistakes as you do your successes. They suck, but they also create a far stronger you, so don't hate them too much, and take responsibility and fix mistakes quickly and professionally. If your mistake hurt someone in some fashion, apologize, make it up to them, and let them see you working hard to get things back to okay, and they'll really like you.

Every five years or so, I look back and think "christ, I didn't have a clue what I was doing then, did I?". It took a couple of those for me to work out that I'd never stop doing that.

#### You can't force someone to change. It doesn't matter how much you care about them or they care about you.

You can encourage change and be hopeful. But you cannot force it.

And the hardest part is that too often trying to get someone to change, out of good intentions and even when you're right, does more harm than good and estranges you from the person. The hardest thing is to be loving and accepting, without forcing anything on the person. As a woman, this is very difficult to accept and painful to put into practice. Is it as hard for men?

I tried changing my ex girlfriend, hence the ex. she initially agreed that what i wanted from her was for her own good, but she eventually felt that she wasnt herself anymore and resented me for it. i dont think ill be trying to change anyone else from now on.

I don't know why you're being downvoted - I had an ex-boyfriend who tried to change some similar things about me. The problem was the way he went about it - very critical and not terribly encouraging. Also when I quit/changed everything I still wasn't good enough and he found new shit that was wrong with me.

As time went by though, she began to change her mind about who she was and who she wanted to be. That's normal for your late teens / early twenties, so you can't fault her at all. But you also can't fault me for being surprised when several of the qualities that I absolutely loved about her (and was so attracted to) began to subside. It wasn't a matter of control, but compatibility and attraction. It'd be like if you were at a place in life where you wanted kids, and you started dating a girl that loved kids and wanted kids more than anything. That's great, right? It's great to be with someone that shares your vision. But then, over a period of a few months, she slowly begins to despise kids. She starts by talking negatively about them and glorifying a life without family. She begins looking down on parents and hanging out with people that never want kids. Until, one day, you find yourself in total and complete love with a person that doesn't share your vision at all. You didn't bargain for that. And it's not her fault that she changed. It just happened. But you are no longer existing on a mutual plane of reality. A wedge has been driven between the two of you. So you panic, because you love this woman. And you don't want her to change into a different person. You want her to always see the value in parenthood and the love and happiness that a child can bring to one's life. But the more that you try to bring her back, the more she pushes away, until one day she completely leaves in pursuit of a childless life, and she resents you for ever trying to keep her from that.

I spent about 6 years trying to get my dad off meth. I lived with my him and my brother who at the time was an alcoholic. I was 25 by the time I gave up and I was completely changed by the end of it, for the worse. I lost what little social skills I had, I missed out on my college years, i pushed away all of my friends, and I became pretty much emotionally dead. I haven't felt true happiness in so long I don't even know what to expect when I do reach that point. Im 27 now and starting to get my life back in order. My dad still does meth but my brother is clean and has his life well in order now. So I guess it wasn't all a waste.

As someone with a bad temper the only thing I found to work is to completely leave the situation. This gets problematic when the other party starts following you around and won't shut-up. I don't care what you're saying. You could be telling me the clear blue sky is beautiful and there's a pile of kittens playing in the front yard, stfu and leave me alone. I need to calm down. There is little more infuriating than someone basically telling you your emotions are invalid, your way of thinking is wrong, and laying out a list of what you should and shouldn't do. I really just need to calm down. Before I really lose it.

My dad always told me, "you don't change people, you change people" I really liked that.

#### Your parents are lost, confused, emotionally damaged, and trying to figure life out just like everyone else.

There was a quote from a parent in Bones about this, went something like "Kids perceive us as gods and we can't help but dissapoint them."

Be kind to your parents, they are just like you.

## Even if you are the most deep and spiritual person, who values all of the little things in life, money still fucking matters. A lot.

Money is absolutely necessary and will bring you happiness by reducing stress and allowing you to go out and experience the world. Money is a physical representation of time (time well spent) and should be spent accordingly. I live by the notion that money will come and go but memories last forever.

A certain amount of money is necessary to avoid misery -- but money does not in fact, buy happiness.

Of course it does. Everything anyone likes to do takes some amount of money, even if it's a single initial purchase. Music, travel, food, art, everything.

Money doesn't buy happiness, money buys control. You can be happy without being rich, and being rich doesn't make you happy, but happy people are in control of their lives, and money helps.

Yes, on the same lines. Money is a tool, which if we'll used can make you happy.

Money can by happiness in certain situations and in certain places. A person with no money/stability in a first world country is less happy then a person earning enough to get by. A person with no/little money in a third world country where the majority of people are in the same situation is often as equally as happy as the person with money in the first world country. Money can directly relate to you emotional state depending on situation. Ill agree with the statement: spending money doesn't directly buy more happiness instantly but does provide the necessary foundation for a happy life depending on your situation.

I've taken a perspective that when your happiness is contingent on other items or people, then you are not happy. Money, food, possessions, people, etc. do not equate to happiness. Satisfaction of the ego, maybe... They are objects that only have meaning because humans gave it some (ignoring concepts like food allowing one to survive since that really isn't "happiness" versus a biological necessity).

Happiness is a state of mind one can achieve without outside influence. Thus, if riding my motorcycle makes me happy, then one can take this statement to suggest that I'm only happy when riding my motorcycle and thus, I'm not happy unless riding my motorcycle (which would be the majority of the time).

Money buys pleasure, not happiness.

Money buys security, safety and well-being. I think those things can be pretty essential to happiness. If you can't afford to get treatment when you are sick, or keep your kids well-fed and cared for, or pay your bills, those things can prevent you from being happy.

I guess I think money allows you the freedom to pursue happiness. Not that people in dire situations can't be happy, but it's a lot harder when it is a constant source of stress for survival every day of your life.

Money provides security and removes worry about if you're going to be hungry or homeless.

Having a roof over my (or family's if you choose) head in a warm bed after a full meal is happiness. Anything more is bonus material.

I think money buys happiness, but you can also accidentally trade that happiness for money if you're not careful.

Money can't erase everything bad (like someone you know dying) but it certainly can buy happiness in other ways, and can reduce misery.
If you get sick - if you have money you can afford quality care and time away from work to deal with it.
If you get sick of what you're doing or need a break, you can afford to take time off and take a great holiday
Need to figure out your life? If you're rich you can leave your job for a while and have a "sabbatical" or some time away.

#### Doctors can't always help you. Stay healthy and try to stay out of the medical system for as long as you can.
Even if you live well, eat healthy, party moderately, exercise regularly and enjoy a stress free life, you might not live to see 60.

Friends really are hard to come by. Find good people, even if you don't have anything in common, and work to cultivate relationships.

Save your money for the things that matter.

Picking a life partner is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make. Don't set your standards so high that you die alone, but don't let a month of loneliness lower your standards.

Religion is powerful, along with a belief in God. That doesn't mean God exists.

"When a man gets down on his knees to pray, you know he'll find what he is able, but chances are he'd find it either way"

Now I know that solid people, people with integrity who will treat you with the respect you deserve, are worth their weight in gold. Do not let them slip through your fingers.

On the other hand, don't be afraid to cut the losers out of your life. People who are negative and don't respect you. They will drag you down and infect your self esteem. Cackle with joy as you exise them from your life, like the cancerous tumors they are.

This should be its own post. Had relationships in collage that I knew could be the cornerstones of a wonderful future. Each one was ruined by selfishness and shortsighted gains. Now I'm jaded enough not to care about a SO and frankly I'm better off without them. They certainly can't say the same.

Two great indicators as when to leave:
Doing drugs without telling their friends (or by themselves).
Putting in far less effort than you do when you're helping them.
Constant lying &/or stealing.
Holds you against their standards that they don't even follow.

#### Just being nice to girls doesn't mean you deserve sex/relationships

More generally: You should be nice to people just because it's the right way to act, not because you want to get something from them.

You shouldn't expect women to be all over you just because you think you are a "nice guy."

Because if you are only nice to women so you can get with them, you may not be so nice after all

It honestly feels like it. Probably more common at gatherings and the such, I get accused of 'liking' someone because I was being very nice, complimenting on their outfits etc. It's a very fine line it seems.

Actually, I think the main thing is that no one should be having sex in exchange or anything. Have sex because sex is fun. Do it for yourself, you shouldn't expect anything in return.

Thinking that you are doing something that warrants something in return is a bad idea. You should always be yourself, be nice because it's a good thing to do.

As an addendum to this: Just because I'm nice to someone doesn't mean I want to fuck them.

You don't really want what you say you want. You don't want nice guys. You don't really want equal pay, equal work, equal relationships, The current setup where women earn 40% of the money and spend 80% is a much better deal than equality, anyway, even if merely equal men weren't a visceral turn-off to women. You want a man who is a man, a man better than you are. A cool, aloof cat making mucho money doing man things, who doesn't care what you or anybody else thinks, a social superior who calls you on your BS and teases you unmercifully. You don't really want a faithful man - your subconscious won't really believe in a man's worth without other women's confirmation. (And guys: in order to maintain her interest you must stay a bit of a challenge, have other options, not be totally open nor always available.) Nor will your subconscious accept a nice guy, a mere good provider, an equal, a house-husband, an androgyne or a smitten adolescent. You may be able to sabotage your own desires long enough to waste your most attractive years acquiring student debt and degrees in a worthless or all-demanding field, putting off any chance of having kids until you're in your 30s, if ever.

#### It's alright to be wrong. You become a much much better person when you realize this. It takes away a certain degree of selfishness that we all have at some point in our lives.

People who can acknowledge their mistakes are people who are willing to become better. Those are people worth being around.

Integrity goes much farther than infallibility.
I also think this applies to: It's alright to not know. People feel so compelled to have an answer and stand by it rather than be willing to find out something new.

I'm the first to admit to my staff that I don't know something. I'll give them a reasoned response prefaced with an "I'm not positive, but..." and concluded with "I'll check in on this to make sure and get back with you." And always fucking get back with the person. Always. One of the best ways to lose confidence in your employees is to not.

I stay away from people who can't admit not knowing, and especially if they perceive it as a shortcoming. They have an incentive to lie.

This is something that I want to just shout from the rooftops. Everyone seems to have an irrational fear of having to say, "I don't know" and they'll jump through very hoop just to make sure that they can avoid having to say that. From colleagues at work to parents. They'll lie about their answer, they'll change the subject, they'll even give you a rude response so as to deflect responsibility, ie. "You should know the answer to that! I can't believe you're asking me this!" All to protect their fragile egos.

If these people spent the same amount of energy in actually finding the answer after admitting that they don't know the answer, we'd all be better off.

And you know what? Being wrong is awesome. I'd much rather be wrong and pleasantly surprised than right and miserable.

And if you never admit you're wrong, you never give yourself a chance to learn.

Being wrong doesn't feel like anything. The realization of being wrong is what makes us uncomfortable. If you knew you are wrong you wouldn't hold that opinion or answer or whatever. But when you are proven wrong or realize so, is what makes us hostile because we don't like being ignorant. So being able to admit you were wrong will only help you learn. If you are so self conscious about looking stupid because you were wrong you will never learn from your mistakes.

And it's really mature and validating to say to someone "You were right."

I honestly believe that people are conditioned to not acknowledge their mistakes because most of the time, when somebody is wrong, the first thing that people do in response is mock and ridicule them. If we were certain that the admittance wouldn't be received in that way, I'm pretty sure people would accept their mistakes way more often.

#### You can't fix everything that goes wrong in your life. Sometimes you just have to make the best of the situation and move forward.

#### Harsh truths?

- Want to get that project done? Quit fucking procrastinating. If not now, when? Fuck that "novel you've been thinking about". Fuck your "idea for a product". Nobody gives a fuck about ideas. Either it's done or it isn't. Either you get it done or it stays and lives in your head forever. Fuck tomorrow. Today is all you fucking have, you lazy piece of shit.
- Want to keep in touch with family better? Pick up your fucking phone and call them for 5 minutes. Tell them you love them. You or they could die before you're done reading this sentence.
- Want to be a better lover? It takes goddamn work and sacrifice. If you feel like a shitty parent, or boyfriend, or wife, how about you quit feeling sorry about it, and change it. Quit being an asshole about it. Buy her flowers. Rub his back. Take your kids to the goddamn park.
- Want to save money? Quit fucking buying shoes or games on Steam. Have some goddamn willpower. You control what you spend on. You will never regret saving money.
- Want to get in shape? Put down your fucking McDonald's. Get off of your fat ass and go to the gym. Fuck, go for 3.5 minutes a day, just go. Do something, anything more than what you're currently doing. You will never regret working out. Ever. If you are overweight and aren't doing anything about it, don't embrace it and say you're happy being the "beautiful you". It's not about being beautiful. Fuck beautiful. It's about doing something for yourself.
- You aren't good enough. You will never be good enough. What the fuck does that even mean? You hit the limit of how good you can be? Fuck. That. Start being a better you. You can always improve. Kick your own ass, because nobody gives enough of a shit to kick it for you.
- Stop waiting for shit to happen. You put on a tie, strap on your best shoes, and fucking make it happen. If you don't, nobody will care but you. Those thoughts of regret will be the thoughts you die with. Doesn't matter how "proud" people are of what you have done, are you proud?
- Make the best of every situation. You can't fucking control 98% of jack shit. But guess what? You control 100% of the shit that you can control. You and only you. If life put you in a shitty situation, realize that you can either accept it and push forward, or wallow in and sink. That decision lies within you, and waiting for things to get better is an excuse to settle and be lazy.
- Quit being a pussy. Go out and get what you want. Want that raise? Ask for it, pussy. The worst that will happen is someone will tell you "no". Boo fucking hoo. But guess what? You might get a "yes". You will never receive anything if you don't ask for it.
- The only person who really cares about every aspect of your life is you. So fucking be good and true to yourself. Don't put others before your happiness, because 99% of them wouldn't put you before theirs. You'll know the few that will.
- Some people will never like or approve of you, no matter what you do. Fuck them. Don't waste one second of your one life worrying about those people.
- Are you not happy with the way things are? Fucking change some shit. Or else it will stay the exact fucking same. If you can't change something, either accept it or work around it. Find a silver lining. I promise there are many in every situation.
- You few fuckers who are actually reading this- guess what? In 100 years, you will be forgotten. Unless you write yourself into history, nobody will utter your name. The things you do here, now, matter to you and you alone. So make yourself happy. Do things to make yourself proud. Throw caution to the wind, because you have nothing to lose. Nothing at all.

Harshness and brutal honesty got me out of a major slump. I thank that friend for being brutal to me, because I needed a kick in the ass. So I pass that ass-kicking on to Reddit. If you are offended by the language or see it as unnecessary, then maybe the advice isn't for you. Some people need it to be as harsh as possible. I did.

I've found that people who claim to be brutally honest focus more on the brutality part rather than the honesty part.

Work long hours? Okay. I guarantee you have ten minutes every day to do some push ups, jumping jacks, sit ups, and squats. Do more than you are doing currently. If you think you don't have time, make it. Wake up 30 minutes earlier than usual. No excuses. Exercise won't make time for you, you make time for it. And no living environment makes you eat unhealthy food. When you buy food, buy healthy food. Guess what? You'll eat healthy food. Going on a jog or walk releases more endorphins than a chocolate donut ever could. Quit associating food with happiness. Food is fuel. That's it. No more excuses.

Worries are thoughts. Worries have never hindered anyone from doing things. The only way worry can stop you is if you give in. Don't be weak. Be strong. Distractions from worries is just an excuse to put off actual work. Facebook doesn't take away your worries, it is easy, requires zero thought, and kills time.

I don't know you, but reading everything you said, I noticed a lot of excuses. Justifying things because you "don't have time", or being "too worried to get a project done". My advice is to make time, and realize that the only person worry affects is you. Worry is also created by you. Stop feeding it. Stop creating it.

For what it's worth, I believe in you. Get up. Shake it all off. Make a to-do list. New year's is coming up. Make some resolutions and stick to them.

#### Life isn't fair. But that's okay--do the best with what you've got and fight the good fight, and you'll have a great life regardless of what it throws at you.

I had to deal with this a few times before I could accept it, but once I did, I was able to let go of trying to control everything and just accept that even if you do it ALL RIGHT, it can still go all wrong. I tell this to my 4 1/2 yr old son all the time, because kids have an innate sense of fairness and justice. My thinking is if he understands what's not fair as 4 yr old then a 5 yr old etc. he will be so prepared for life and have the necessary coping skills to successfully bounce back from hardships.

I used to envy my friends because of how great their lives were. I would yell at my parents for not working hard enough (I thought that was why we were poor or were always struggling). As I grew older I realized that they busted their asses, but shit happens. Life isn't fair. We aren't all equally lucky, but I'll be damned if I won't keep up the good fight like they havw

#### I am apparently not a hummingbird, so my diet of sugar and sugar water is not ideal.

#### Just because you are busy doesn't mean you are accomplishing anything.

It's really, really difficult to put in 8 hours of work a day, five days a week. Most people take 8-9 hours to put in 2-3 hours worth of actual work in a day, if that.

I think this is a really good point, but at the same time I've very happily done hard jobs for longer than eight hours a day, and done it for weeks on end.
It's all about environment. The reality is that the modern business environment is geared towards micromanagement and not human efficiency or happiness.

This is a very important realization if you want to get through university. I've known lots of people who were "working" their asses off and still failed the tests while others put in 3-4 hours of real work every other day and did really well.

#### you won't succeed without taking on responsibility

And the more responsibility you take on the more people you are going to piss off.

I think you have to be careful with statements like that. I've seen a lot of really shitty managers (in important roles too, not just retail or whatever) hide behind statements like "If you're making enemies, you're doing something right".

You need to live with your decisions. Your life. If you've fucked up - there's no changing that. Sometimes those fuck ups are permanent fixtures on yourself, sometimes they will be a perpetual guilt on your mind, but you need to deal with those. There's no going back. Sometimes it won't even be your fault, but still, there's no going back. As much as you wish you could start it all again, you can't. You need to live with yourself.

#### Sometimes someone just won't love you back, and it's hard but you just need to get on with life and find someone who will love you back.

If you'll excuse the metaphor: If someone jumps ship, you can't just drop anchor and hope they climb back aboard, you could spend your entire life trying to find someone who doesn't want to be found. The wind is going to keep blowing and it might take you somewhere good, somewhere better, or it might not, but you need to take control and set course in the direction that you want to move in, for yourself, rather than put another person in the drivers seat of your life (whether they want it or not).

Life is the greatest adventure, and it has its ups and downs and everything you experience, good or bad, can be learned from, and every time you do go through a bad experience, you'll hopefully come out the other end a little wiser, a little stronger, probably a little more jaded, but hopefully a little more optimistic that things can get better. But it takes strength, and it may not feel like you have that strength, and it'll take more effort than you think you can muster, but everyone has this strength inside of them, and it comes from discovering (or rediscovering) themselves, and being happy with who you are. Sometimes it takes a little nudge from your family or friends, and I highly suggest finding a shoulder to cry on, preferably in person.

Post-break up I've learned a lot about myself. I've learned that I have a lot of love to give and that I can't force someone to accept it. One day I will find someone who will reciprocate, not because they feel obligated to, but because they genuinely want to.

To more directly answer your question, if someone doesn't want you, then they simply don't deserve you. Do not, under any circumstances, change who you are because that's what they want, you will eventually resent them for it. Focus on being who you want to be, who you're happy with being, and you will attract people who love you for you. You need to learn to be happy on your own, instead of being dependent on someone else.

I'm starting to think this post won't help at all. Right now in my life I'm thinking I need to cut my ex out of my life, not out of hatred or anger, but because I think it's best for everyone. Loving someone is essentially an addiction, and the only way to overcome addiction is to cut it out completely, and try your hardest to focus on other things.

When you miss/yearn for someone that you are infatuated with you need to stop and realize that it isn't that person that you love, but rather an interpretation or idea of that person. That image you have is within you and part of you and will never line up with the actual person because we are all so very fickle.

Eventually you get over it. It may be awhile but you will.

Overcoming it will be one of the most eye opening experiences and points of personal growth that you will experience.

Mine took years. It never made sense to me either.

First off, no one is the person you think they are, this is especially true for the person you love. You infer so much about others by their glances, smiles, laughter, etc, and being infatuated with this person has probably caused you to do it more than with others.

Over time, as the pain and confusion you're currently feeling subside, you'll reflect with a much clearer mind. The assessment you make about the other person, yourself and the two of you together will be from a much clearer mind and you will see why it wasn't meant to be.
Reaching that health state of mind is a roller coaster. You'll find yourself emotionally guarded. Uncertain of yourself. However, there is a clarity and maturity that will be developed in the end that will allow you to love and be loved in a way that wouldn't have been possible previously.
Until then, the "delete facebook, hit the gym" mentality is a great one to have. It doesn't have to be deleting Facebook or hitting the gym specifically. It's really about experiencing the world, not thinking about the one whose affections wont be returned and improving yourself so you can be more proud/secure of yourself. Facebook sucks because you'll see that person when they should be the last thing on your mind, and the gym will provide tangible improvements in you both physically and mentally.

Hopefully this person's love wasn't your only goal. It never should be because that will break a relationship right there. If it was you need to make some new goals, possibly steal someone else's till you can get your own. Then keep pushing forward, overcome those obstacles, and get to that point where thinking back about the person you were today makes you shake your head and smile because you're happy that things worked out the way they did.

#### Being a victim won't get you anywhere. It gives others power over you and distracts you from winning the game of life.

There is no winning, only crossing the finish line.

Yes and no. It's true there's nothing to be gained by wallowing in despair instead of taking action. At the same time, it's usually the people taking advantage of you who want you to embrace the idea that being a victim is just a state of mind.

this applies to ever group that lacks whatever "privilege" is popular at the moment. By complaining that white people have power isn't making your grades go up at your school. By saying that skinny people are mean to fat people shows that you (if you are fat) actually do care what society thinks (and that you don't truly believe that fat=beautiful). If you didn't care, you wouldn't listen to them. Are you from a poor area? Don't wallow in it and blame circumstance for the crime in your area but rather the community for not raising their sons properly to be respectful of authority.

Thats not to say that minorities don't face struggle and hardship, and I'm not discounting the pain they face. But I believe on focusing on the practical (what you can do with what your given) instead of the theoretical (how you feel). Want to stick it to the man? prove him wrong and get a PHD despite your background. Want to show skinny people up? Lose the weight or design and sell a brand of clothes if you are so convinced that fat is healthy. Taking a victim's attitude won't change the problem.

#### No one knows what they're doing.

Fake it until you make it.

I a couple weeks back I thought I couldn't go zip lining because I am scared of heights, I but I faked being able to handle it and soon that very same fear of heights became conquerable to me.

It is a slight exaggeration, but a lot of things in life can be succeeded in with just confidence

#### Takes a lot of endurance and hard work to get rid of your fat.

Not always. Turns out not eating for a while is a great way to lose a lot of weight way too quickly :P

Belly fat is the hardest to lose. It's also the most visible and obvious, which means there's more stored in that area hence it being harder to get rid of.
It's the last part of my body which is being stubborn. My glutes and thighs are more visible, my face looks thinner and my slightly-less-than-double chin has shrunk a lot. I can even feel my abs by running my fingers up my stomach, something I couldn't do as recently as six months ago.

Losing weight is simple, burn more calories than you consume.
Actually doing it? Well that's where it gets tricky.
Losing weight is simple, not easy.

#### It's much harder to make new friends after you leave school.

The best thing to do is to find a community that you will love being a part of. There are few things in life that are more rewarding than being a part of something.

False. The only thing you need to become friends with someone is time spent performing the same activity, and a willingness to be the first to speak.

And you'll likely spend your 30s losing friends. And know what - you'll be 100% okay with that.

It was really hard for me to make friends in school at all. I mean real friends, not those who are friendly and the minute you aren't there they talk bullshit about you. I've always been sensible about those things. Now, after university, working, it gets even harder to meet people. Yep, it sucks.

That's probably your own experience, but for most people I'd say you're wrong. You're probably thinking that those friendships made at school are deeper but in actual fact they're just longer.

Nah it's not, I make far more friends since I left the suffocating social hierarchy that was school where if you were bad at sports and a bit fugly you could get no where.
Now i'm a qualified Snowsports Instructor, Dive Master and Surfing Instructor and I make countless new friends every week. I'm a socialite and feel comfortable just rocking up to people and chatting. Total change from those shitty school years.
Everything is what you make of it, saying its hard to make friends is a self fulfilling prophecy, chances are you just need more sociable hobbies and hangouts.

#### Meeting your heroes is typically disappointing -- you have to be your own hero.

I look at it differently. When I learn they are human it makes the goals i have seem a bit less impossible.

I agree...That's why I've always liked Thomas Jefferson's interpretation of Jesus.
A man, no matter how extraordinary, can be emulated; but a God?

#### True friends are hard to find.

I have a feeling that this is wicked true but nobody wants to believe it. Like others are just good quotes and you don't have a problem believing. But this is weird.

I respectfully disagree. Everyone wants to be loved, and most will cling to whoever is being a true friend to them.
Be what you consider a true friend to as many as you can, and most will retaliate that. But your true friends don't have to be the ones you met in first grade.
Figure out who deserves your time. Be a true friend to everyone you meet, but if they don't return the gesture don't be afraid to leave them behind and move on.

My life is full of great people I would give an arm and a leg for, and 90% of them would do it for me.
The last 10% haven't shown their true colors yet, and will be replaced

An insincere and evil friend is more to be feared than a wild beast; a wild beast may wound your body, but an evil friend will wound your mind. ~Buddha

It took a long time for me to learn this but after I did my life improved tremendously. My social circle shrank but the friends I have now take joy in my life and successes just as I do theirs. They are much more fulfilling friendships than the ones I had in my youth. Truth is, I had to learn to be a true friend before I could find them.

As you grow older you start hating more people. Why you ask? Because, small child, you start to see the realness in them. People start to show their true colors and they're not as pretty as your crayola 96 assorted color + 4 metallic crayons set. Nope. They will develop into people who are OK to talk to, but you have to be careful about what you tell them, or they might use it against you.

#### Sometimes your boss isn't your boss for any decent reason. They may not be smarter than you, nor more skilled. Often they just knew someone. Only stay as long as it benefits you, opportunities don't always fall into your lap. You have to work for them and hunt them down.

A lot of the time, you boss is your boss because they got the same job you did...just earlier. In bureaucracies, this means that if you don't like your boss, get a new job, because they're gonna be there for a long time.

My farther who is the boss of a lot of people said this quote "being a boss is like running a football team, you got the players who do the work and ern the results, the trainers/on field manager makes sure that the players are doing everything right and I just sit up the back making sure that everyone's on task" he also loved sports.

#### Part of being an adult is that every year someone dies that you were once close with.

I would say that the single defining feature of being an "Adult" is that people you love get ill and start to die. As a child you're sheltered from it or don't understand it, or it's just some musty distant relation you can't quite remember from aunt Mabels 70th birthday party who is now in a box. But when people close to you begin to die, or get horrible illnesses, and you HAVE to deal with the emotions, that's when life gets to be hard work and you fell like an adult.

My dad had me when he was 40 and he was the baby of the family. I lost a lot of people close to me way before I left childhood. Now I'm just sort of resigned to the decline of myself and everyone else. It's depressing. I tell myself you know you and everyone will be dead. It's inevitable. Get out there. Enjoy yourself. But I can't seem to do it.

#### Not everyone finds someone.

"There are millions of people out there who we've all unanimously decided are light-speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips even"-Louis CK

Female primates (including humans) are considered "guaranteed fitness," which means all females capable of reproduction are guaranteed to reproduce if they simply agree to do so. Even without a marriage, relationship, etc.
There are studies supporting this in humans. A female 1/10 can literally just ask to reproduce, and a male will oblige. The converse is not true for males asking females.

#### Life's not fair. At all. Yes, this is basic but really think about it. Some people are born well off. They never have to work a day in their life, and they have everything handed to them.

And just because some people have money does not mean that they're happy. Sometimes they're deeply miserable human beings. If you are generally unhappy, you would probably be just as unhappy if you were given money. Not only would you would find something else to worry about, you wouldn't have anything to work towards anymore.

Or life is neither unfair or fair, some people are born well off, and then get cancer and die, some people are rich their whole lives but they can never fully trust or love someone, some people are poor and stay poor until the day they die, some people aren't able to walk.... ultimately the only fairness is the chance to exist and realize our consciousness, the idea of fairness comes solely from how we choose compare ourselves to others.

And that's ok. Life is really fucking unfair and it's sad but nothing you do can change that. Nothing at all. Which is why it's ok.

#### The harsh truth is that adult relationships really aren't all that different than from when your a teenager. Other harsh truths I've learned, is that people will only be friends with a loser in order to make themselves feel better about themselves when they are feeling sorry for themselves.

You'll always stir up resentment when you've become more successful than friends and family.

he loses weight, gets fit, gets hot, and suddenly a whole bunch of girls who would have never looked at him before start getting interested. Girls that are better looking than his girlfriend, smarter, have better jobs, higher social status, more money. And they aren't bad girls. They are genuinely decent girls who actually like him, but wouldn't have been attracted to him when he was heavy. That's a lot of motivation to leave behind the old girlfriend. She's nice and all but she doesn't seem to have as much drive or ambition as these new Girls. He improved herself and she's just standing still. You know that really cute girl with the MBA and great car was talking on her phone to someone about her beach house. She always smiles at him when they bump into each other at the coffee shop. When she gave him her phone number he just took it to be polite. But she does seem fun. It wouldn't really be a crime to just talk on the phone, right? I mean, they could just be friends...

Self-identifying as a loser is bullshit. People are only friends with people who make them feel good, sure: if you're a downer all the time, your phone will stop ringing. You can be weird, be less attractive, and have weird hobbies and still contribute to groups of friends both mainstream and niche. I'm sure there are people who hang out with people solely to feel better about themselves, but they are certainly not the majority of people, and they are certainly not friends.

You only stir up resentment with family and friends when you make them feel weird about the fact that you're successful. Everyone loves the guy who opens doors and picks up a disproportionate share of tabs, everyone hates the person who makes them feel like they don't belong.

Success has its own perils. I was academically successful and man, dealing with the resentment of people I knew from high school was really bad. God, they were such douchebags to me and I didn't know why. I eventually had to cut them all out of my life: a whole social circle.

Adult relationships should be much different from teenage relationships. If they're not, you've got some growing up to do.

Because teenage relationships are dominated by hormones and idealism.
Adult relationships require humility, compromise, sacrifice, and hard work. It's no longer just about what feels best, but what is for the best.
They're just different animals, with different rewards and pitfalls. Teenage relationships often revolve around the idea of soulmates, while an adult relationship hinges on a partnership. It's harder work, but cooperatively working to build something for each other is much more rewarding, in my opinion.
I guess that's the fundamental difference, to me. A teenage relationship is often a case of each person doing what makes themselves happy and an adult relationship is often a case of each person doing what makes each other happy.

#### I am going to die. No way anyone under 30 understands this.

I am going to die. No way anyone under 30 understands this.
From 30- to 35 you think "Damn I'm getting old. Just can't hang like I used to. Ha Ha".
35-40 you really see those gray hairs and truly notice that receding hairline that have been there for a couple years but suddenly it "hits you."
40- You wake up and you just know without a single doubt that in a short 20 or so years you will die. Odds are it will be some cancer that is discovered on Monday and you die on Friday.

When you are 58 like me (if by the grace of God you last this long) you can still convince yourself that death might be 20 or so years away. in fact "old" is always about 20 years older than you are yourself. And this is good. Just enjoy the ride.

For me old is always the age of my father. My mother died at 48 and I didn't realize just how young that was to die until a few years ago.

I think its not the age that determines the understanding of death. I believe it has something to do with how often you were confronted with death in the past. I am 23 and am fully aware that i am going to die, most likely in my 60's, and chances are high its gonna be cancer.

What it took me a long time to deeply understand is that the old version of me who is going to die is still me. It was always easy when I was young to think of old me as another person without even realizing it.
My personality has changed a lot but I'm still the same guy who went to prom 12 years ago and it'll be this same me when I'm old and dying, staring into the abyss before seeing my very existence fade away.

As a younger person, I definitely cannot imagine that 20 years is short. I guess it comes with time, :/

29 now. I've been well aware of my impending death for several years. When I finally began actively reflecting on this I became a much different human being.

I thinks it's awfully presumptuous to say that no way anyone under 30 understands that they are going to die. People are all different and have different thought processes. Some people never realize that life is finite. Others come to grips with their own mortality at a very young age.

I know I'm going to die, I don't see much point in banging on about it, I'm having too much fun living my life, it's not like it's sneaking up on me and I'll be all shocked and like "hey no fair" quite likely I won't care at that point too, being dead and all.

#### Being 'grown up' is nowhere near as awesome as I thought it would be.

I have to disagree. I would never to back to being a child. As an adult you can do whatever you wish, you have the mental capacity to explore the world, you see beauty in smaller things, and most importantly of all I can eat my fucking ice cream before my meal because I'm a fucking adult.

Being a kid was awesome, but so is being an adult. If I want to pack up all of my shit and leave, nothing can stop me and that in itself is pretty cool. Paying bills isn't fun, but it's necessary so I don't harp on it like other people seem to want to do.

So basically, being 20-27 is good, cause you're physically prime, mentally prime, have no rules, and don't have that much responsibility yet. Being an adult is not 'getting to do whatever you want' once you pass a certain threshold (could be in the 30's or maybe 40's) because you have more responsibilities and also the frontal lobe finishes development so you by nature become less of a risk taking person. You can do whatever you want, but you probably want to do less things anyways

If you get your bachelor's to work at an unfulfilling job, marry because you're afraid of finding someone else, get yourself into debt, and have kids to fill the void, then yeah, being grown up won't be awesome. It'll be, gasp, a lot of stress for nothing, like most adults... have.

Don't be. The single greatest realization I had as an adult is that nobody can make you do anything. Nobody can make you do anything. Conversely, some of the best times you can have as an adult is when you throw adulthood to the wind and act like a big goofball or enjoy something ridiculously mundane (like a trip to Home Depot). The best thing about being an adult is that you can plan periods of total irresponsibility* and still come out of it with your ass covered.
