## How I got to 200 productive hours a month
[Reference](https://qotoqot.com/blog/improving-focus/)

- This is 6 hours a day in a month.
- Productive environment: increase the friction required to slip into distracting activities, so that it takes a significant effort to get distracted.
- What is more effective--eliminate everything distracting from your workstation and using a separate device for leisure in another room.
- Unsubscribe/mute/unfollow too-active posters, which includes all non-professional news.
- Re politics: you can't do anything meaningful about these events.
- Re phone: you shouldn't be able to mindlessly reach for it to escape your current task with a "quick check."
- Planning:
  - Split big tasks to small ones.
  - Boring simple tasks in the evening.
  - Adjust task order before going to sleep, so there's always a clear plan in the morning.
- Chats and messengers are off, doors are closed, people around you are informed that they shouldn't disturb you.

### Body

- There's not virtue in wearing out the body for the sake of some short-term deadlines.
- **Crunch is not productive--it is an emergency effort to compensate for the lack of real productivity that is achieved through good planning and sharp focus.**
- 30-60 minute naps if I feel "brain fog" in the middle of the day because sleep flushes out brain toxins and clears the mind.
- Waking up at the same time: discipline is more sustainable than the ever-changing motivation.
- Physical inactivity not only kills us, but it affects your memory and thinking too.
- The researchers found that the widening of the artery in response to blood flow reduced over three hours spent sitting without moving. However, getting up for five-minute walks in this period stopped this from happening.
- **On your desktop install an app that forces 3-5 minute breaks every hour. What's very important: make it block the screen completely and hide all the "skip" or "postpone" buttons, or you'll be ignoring these breaks.**
- Re productivity/mood: the diet is not complicated.

#### Mind

- Habit-tracking apps: they both remind you to do things and motivate you to keep daily streaks.
- No zero days.
- You can figure out if you can do tedious tasks when you know your head is empty.
- Music:
  - Fast tracks to boost focus.
  - Lower tempo or something relaxing or no music if high cognitive load.
  - Resting your mind: no phone or consuming any kind of content--just walking, exercising, or taking a nap.
- Procrastination: task is too complex or too boring, fear of failure, simple laziness.
- Meditation again.
- Working on something futile? Spending your life on fruitless nonsense.
- **Throwing away addictive sites or gaming becomes easy when you start to see them for what they are: obstructions on the way to getting something valuable done.**

## Attention, Please! What Every Man Ought to Know About Focus
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/01/20/attention-please-what-every-man-ought-to-know-about-focus/)

- Single-minded focus is just one facet of attention. Attention has different types! You must manage all your other attention mechanisms.
- Attention: taking possession of the mind of one of what seems like several simultaneous possible objects or trains of thought.
- LSD causes psychedelic experiences because it inhibits the brain's attention networks.
- What you are focusing on becomes your reality.
- Involuntary attention.
  - When we head a loud noise, etc.
  - Benefit: we get to react automatically to potentially dangerous or rewarding stimuli.
  - THIS HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY THINGS LIKE YOUTUBE.
  - A mild stimulation gives our mind soft fascination.
  - This is why spending time in nature not only feels great, but has been shown to relieve stress, anxiety, and depression.
- Voluntary attention.
  - This requires effort, willpower, and intentional concentration.
  - The more stimuli there are for involuntary attention, the harder our voluntary attention has to work to stay engaged with the task at hand.
  - Voluntary attention is what allows you to progress with your personal goals.
  - We have a finite amount of it. People complain about feeling distracted because the modern world taxes our voluntary attention so much. We need to consciously decide all the stimuli.
- Default mode: Mind wandering.
  - Mind wandering = taking your voluntary attention away from whatever you're supposed to be doing.
  - Problem: we aren't fully present, and when we let our minds wander, we drift towards negative thoughts and emotions.
  - Benefits: The brains' way of directing unused processing power towards solving unresolved problems in your life.
  - Positive-constructive daydreaming: future planning, reminiscing, moral reasoning.
  - This can also increase creativity.
  - This gives your voluntary/involuntary systems a break.
- Broad attention: surveying a field. This makes you better at understanding the big picture.
- Narrow attention: focusing on a pass. This allows us to be meticulous.

### Benefits of managing attention

- Improves relationships.
- Boosts resilience.
- Increases happiness.
- Increases creativity.
- Deepens our wisdom.
- Improves our critical thinking.
- Gives us a more flourishing and enjoyable life.

- Problem: We now live in "present shock", information is conveyed via memes and tweets, and we find it hard to separate the signal from the noise.

- Managing different kinds of attention is like being the supreme commander of your mind. You must be able to deftly maneuver and deploy your units to various battles.
- The mind is a muscle. Your muscles have a limited amount of strength at any given time, and they can atrophy or strengthen from vigorous exercise.

- **You have to tell yourself to dig deeper. You'll be surprised how much more strength and focus you actually have left in the tank.**
