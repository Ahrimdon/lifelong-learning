## How I got to 200 productive hours a month
[Reference](https://qotoqot.com/blog/improving-focus/)

- This is 6 hours a day in a month.
- Productive environment: increase the friction required to slip into distracting activities, so that it takes a significant effort to get distracted.
- What is more effective--eliminate everything distracting from your workstation and using a separate device for leisure in another room.
- Unsubscribe/mute/unfollow too-active posters, which includes all non-professional news.
- Re politics: you can't do anything meaningful about these events.
- Re phone: you shouldn't be able to mindlessly reach for it to escape your current task with a "quick check."
- Planning:
  - Split big tasks to small ones.
  - Boring simple tasks in the evening.
  - Adjust task order before going to sleep, so there's always a clear plan in the morning.
- Chats and messengers are off, doors are closed, people around you are informed that they shouldn't disturb you.

### Body

- There's not virtue in wearing out the body for the sake of some short-term deadlines.
- **Crunch is not productive--it is an emergency effort to compensate for the lack of real productivity that is achieved through good planning and sharp focus.**
- 30-60 minute naps if I feel "brain fog" in the middle of the day because sleep flushes out brain toxins and clears the mind.
- Waking up at the same time: discipline is more sustainable than the ever-changing motivation.
- Physical inactivity not only kills us, but it affects your memory and thinking too.
- The researchers found that the widening of the artery in response to blood flow reduced over three hours spent sitting without moving. However, getting up for five-minute walks in this period stopped this from happening.
- **On your desktop install an app that forces 3-5 minute breaks every hour. What's very important: make it block the screen completely and hide all the "skip" or "postpone" buttons, or you'll be ignoring these breaks.**
- Re productivity/mood: the diet is not complicated.


#### Mind

- Habit-tracking apps: they both remind you to do things and motivate you to keep daily streaks.
- No zero days.
- You can figure out if you can do tedious tasks when you know your head is empty.
- Music:
  - Fast tracks to boost focus.
  - Lower tempo or something relaxing or no music if high cognitive load.
  - Resting your mind: no phone or consuming any kind of content--just walking, exercising, or taking a nap.
- Procrastination: task is too complex or too boring, fear of failure, simple laziness.
- Meditation again.
- Working on something futile? Spending your life on fruitless nonsense.
- **Throwing away addictive sites or gaming becomes easy when you start to see them for what they are: obstructions on the way to getting something valuable done.**
