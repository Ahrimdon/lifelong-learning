## [4 Habits of Punctual People](http://www.fastcompany.com/3025074/work-smart/4-habits-of-punctual-people)

1. __They’re realistic thinkers.__ Punctual people know how long things take. Chronically late people, however, engage in what DeLonzor calls "magical thinking." If once, 10 years ago, they made it to work in 20 minutes, they believe that’s how long it should take,” she says. “They forget about the 99% of the times that took 30 minutes.

    To develop realistic habits, DeLonzor suggests relearning to tell time. Write down how long you think it takes to shower, get ready in the morning and drive to work. Then for a week, track how long those things really take. Chronically late people are often off of their time estimates by 25% to 30%, says DeLonzor.

2. __They give themselves buffer time.__ Late people get stressed out from being late, too, but they don’t strive to be early; they tend to time things to the minute. To be punctual, plan to arrive early.

3. __They’re organized.__ DeLonzor says that 45% of everything we do on a daily basis is automatic: “Our lives are filled with habits--from the way you brush teeth to how you get dressed and leave for work,” she says, adding that they’re necessary. “If we didn’t do things automatically, it would take us forever to get through our day.” 

    The habits of people who are always on time are highly structured. They analyze their daily activities, set routines, and stick to them on regular basis. Chronically late people, however, don’t have structure and often fall on the attention deficit disorder spectrum, says DeLonzor.

    To become punctual, DeLonzor suggests putting more routines and structure into your life. For example, do everything you can to prepare for the morning the night before.

4. __They’re comfortable with downtime.__ Chronically late people, however, hate downtime. They enjoy the thrill of that last-minute sprint to the finish line and crave stimulation. To be more comfortable with downtime, bring along something to fill those spare moments.
