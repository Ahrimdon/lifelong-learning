# Declutter Your Mind: How to Stop Worrying, Relieve Anxiety, and Eliminate Negative Thinking

## Four Causes of Mental Clutter

- *Daily Stress.* The stress created by information overload, physical clutter, and the endless choices required from these things can trigger an array of mental health issues like generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.
  - When life becomes so intense and complicated, our psyches search out escape ramps. Too much input, too much negative exposure, and too many choices can trigger a not-so-healthy coping response.
- *The Paradox of Choice.* More choices might afford objectively better results, but they won't make you happy. Obama just wears gray or blue suits, because he has other decisions to make.
- *Too Much "Stuff".* Clothes we never wear, books we won't read, toys that are unused, and gadgets that don't see the light of day.
  - All extra stuff produces reactive, anxious, and negative thoughts.
  - Everything seems important and urgent.
- *The Negativity Bias.* Negative stimuli produces more neural activity than do equally intense positive ones. They are also perceived more easily and quickly. This means you are hardwired to overthink, worry, and view situations more negatively than they are in reality.
- *Mindfulness requires retraining your brain to stay out of the mental clutter from the future and focus instead on the present moment.*

## Mental Declutter Habit #1: Focused Deep Breathing

- If you want to take over your breathing, you have that power.
- A change in breathing is often the first sign that our thoughts are overwhelming and stressful. When we feel anxious, depressed, rushed, or upset, we may experience rapid breathing or shortness of breath.
- Keep in mind:
  - Sit up straighter to allow more room for your lungs to take in oxygen.
  - Be conscious of breathing through your nose rather than your mouth.
  - When you inhale, use abdominal breathing.
  - Pay attention to the difference between shallow breathing (stops at the chest) and abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing (filling the lower lobes of the lungs).
- *Slow, deep, rhythmic breathing.* This stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system, reduces your heart rate, relaxes your muscles, calms your mind, and normalizes brain function.
- Shift awareness away from worry and quieting the inner dialog in your brain.

### Summary of Deep Nose Breathing

- Boost nitric oxide, immune-boosting molecule produced in the sinuses during nose breathing.
- Improve the quality of your blood through eliminating toxins and increased oxygenation.
- Assist digestive system.
- Increase oxygenation.
- Better abdominal organs through increased circulation.
- Basically it's good.

*By practicing a few minutes of deep abdominal breathing*

### Steps

- Determine a time of day to practice deep breathing. (After brushing your teeth in the morning?)
- Set a setting for your breathing practice in a quiet space where you won't be distracted.
- Set a timer for 10 minutes.
- Sit on the floor with a pillow in a meditative position, or in a chair with your spin straight and feet planted on the floor.
- Inhale slowly through your nose until your lungs are filled to capacity, allowing your stomach to push out on inhalation.
- At the end of the inhalation, pause for a count of two.
- Exhale slowly, smoothly, and completely.

## Mental Declutter Habit #2: Meditation

- Meditation is simply exercise for the brain.
- *Most practices begin with the same steps--sitting quietly, focusing attention on your breath, and dismissing any distractions that come your way.*
- We suggest meditation as a tool to help you train your mind and control your thoughts, both when you are sitting in meditation and when you aren't.
- The key to finding satisfaction with meditation is simply to practice. By making a daily commitment to meditation, you will improve your skills and discover how the mental, physical, and emotional benefits increase over time.
- On the days she meditates, she is less anxious and agitated and more focused in her work, especially with writing.
- Increased ability to stay in the present moment and redirect herself back to the task at hand whenever she feels tempted by a potential distraction.
- *Meditation is a lot like doing reps at a gym. It strengthens your attention muscle.*
- Benefits: Productivity, focus, decreases stress, brainpower, improves the symptoms of depression and anxiety, thicken the learning and memory areas of the brain.

## Steps

- Select a quiet, calm space for your meditation practice where you can close the door to be completely alone.
- Determine a specific time of day for your practice.
- Try not to recline as you meditate, since you might fall asleep.
- Remove all distractions.
- Close your eyes, or keep them open with a downward focused gaze, then take a few deep cleansing breaths through your nose.
- Focus your attention on the sensation of breathing, perhaps even mentally thinking the word "in" as you inhale and "out" as you exhale.
- Other thoughts: Don't pay attention, just try to concentrate on your breathing.
- *You'll likely notice other perceptions and sensations like sounds, physical discomfort, emotions. Simply notice these, and then return to the sensation of breathing.*
- *Your goal is to increasingly become the witness to all sounds, sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise and pass away. View them as though you are observing them from a distance without judgment or internal comment.*
- Rather than your mind taking control and running away whenever a thought or distraction occurs, you eventually gain more and more control of your mind and your ability to redirect it back to the present.

- With practice, you won't need to constantly redirect your thoughts. Thoughts begin to drop away naturally, and your mind opens up to the immense stillness and vastness of just being present.
- "The gap": the silent space between thoughts. When you become more practiced, you'll find the gap opens wider and more frequently, and you can rest in it for longer periods of time.
- Early, you might think that you are constantly redirecting your thoughts, noticing your physical discomforts, and wondering why you're bothering with the practice at all.
- You can write down thoughts on your mental state.

## Mental Declutter Habit #3: Reframe All Negative Thoughts

- Evolution has shaped our brains to suffer psychologically: to compare, evaluate, criticize ourselves, to focus on what we're lacking, be dissatisfied with what we have, and to imagine frightening scenarios, most of which will never happen.
- Strategies
  - *Be the Watcher.* Observing your thoughts rather than attaching to them disempowers the thoughts and the emotions they foster.
  - *Name that Thought.* Acknowledge that your thoughts are thoughts, not reality.
  - *Just say no.* "Stop!" out loud (vocalizing reinforces the interruption), and then visualize a heavy metal wall slamming down in front of your runaway thoughts.
  - *The Rubber Band Trick.* If you get stuck in negative thinking, pop the rubber band on your wrist. This physical action interrupts the flow of negative thought.
  - *Know Your Triggers.* Pay attention to common worries and anxieties you brood about.
  - *Distract Yourself.* Do something that will occupy your mind so there's no room for the negative thoughts. Do some multiplication or try to memorize a poem.

## Mental Declutter Habit #4: Teach Your Old Mind New Tricks

- *Challenge the Thought and Replace It.* Oftentimes, these thoughts are wildly exaggerated. They are not the truth, or at least not the whole truth. If you think you are a loser, be truthful that you've done plenty of things well and have been successful on many occasions.
  - Challenge these negative thoughts whenever they occur. *This simply means coming up with a concrete example that contradicts the thought by reminding yourself of a positive event or a previous win.*
  - Use positive reviews and positive reminders. They might feel awkward at first, but you'll train yourself to interrupt those cycles of negative thinking.
- *Practice Acceptance.* Sometimes, it's the thoughts and feelings about these challenging situations that are often far worse than the solution itself.
  - When you struggle against the reality of a bad situation, you're adding another layer of suffering to your psyche. *You can't worry of guilt yourself into a solution. Instead, you need a clear head and a calm mind.*
  - *When you find yourself struggling, say "I accept this situation is happening."*
  - You can: improve it, seek out anything positive you can learn from it, and find ways to get support as you are enduring it.
- *Take Mindful Action.* Overthinking is pointless, so why not turn that energy into structured thinking and then action?
  - Writing, practicing an instrument, constructing something by hand, painting, working on a complex problem, studying, memorizing something, practicing a speech, and designing something from scratch.
- *Set a Worry Timer.* Set a timer for 10 to 15 minute and allow yourself to stress over whatever enters your mind. You can write things down in a journal.

# Decluttering Your Life Obligations

## The Importance of Core Values

- We have more information, data, and material possessions available to us, but this doesn't come with instructions on how to manage it.
- Grandparents: No time-saving technology, but they weren't inundated with the stream of information and deluge of choices that we experience every minute of the day.
- *Define Your Core Values.*
- Why is this important?
  - Your core values can serve as a measuring stick for all your choices and decisions in life, keeping you focused on the person you want to be and the life you wish to lead.
  - By living in alignment with your values, you create the best environment for happiness, peace, and clear thinking.
  - Core values form a foundation for your life that endures through time, life difficulties, and major changes.
  - One of Barrie's core values is freedom and flexibility. Once she defined this value, she didn't want to pursue a traditional 9-to-5 job because she wouldn't be happy.
  - *Values act as our compass to put us back on course every single day, so that day after day, we're moving in the direction that takes us closer and closer to the definition of the "best" life we could possibly live. The "best" is your own ideal, but generally as you get closer to this ideal, you'll enjoy increasingly positive shades of "better" even if you never reach "best". And this makes sense because many results in life exist on a continuum.*

## Strategy #1: Identify your Core Values

- Competence. A sufficiency of means for the necessities and conveniences of life. Having requisite or adequate ability or qualities.
- Inquisitiveness: Given to inquiry, research, or asking questions, eager for knowledge, intellectually curious. Unduly or inappropriately curious, prying.
- Hacker: An expert at programming and solving problems with a computer. Automates things. Computer programming must be a hobby, something done for fun, not out of a sense of duty or for the money. [Reference](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/hacker.html)
- Candor: The quality of being open and honest in expression; frankness. Freedom from bias, impartiality.
- Tenacity: The quality of holding fast, persistent, and the quality or property of holding together firmly.
- Wittiness: Mental sharpness, keen intelligence, and a natural aptitude for using words and ideas in a quick and inventive way to create humor.

- Start with the area of your life where you feel the biggest disconnect. This is where you likely feel the most internal pain and mental agitation.

## Strategy #1: Clarify Your Life Priorities

- How much time per day do you feel you waste on activities unrelated to your core values?
- How are you spending your money unconsciously?
- How are you interacting with the people you care about unconsciously?
- How do you make career decisions (do you have a predetermined plan or do you spend most of your day in "reaction mode")?

### Seven Main Life Areas

- Career
- Family
- Marriage (or love partnership)
- Spiritual/personal growth/self-improvement
- Leisure/social
- Life management
- Health and fitness

- 98 hours per week (minus sleep, hygiene, and eating). In an ideal world, how would you prioritize those seven key areas of your life?
- When you change priorities, you have to give up something in a day. You have to create new and challenging habits, and take the difficult necessary actions.
- Over time, you won't miss those old habits, choices, and behaviors--and your life will flow more easily because you are living authentically, true to your values and priorities.
