# Declutter Your Mind: How to Stop Worrying, Relieve Anxiety, and Eliminate Negative Thinking

## Four Causes of Mental Clutter

- *Daily Stress.* The stress created by information overload, physical clutter, and the endless choices required from these things can trigger an array of mental health issues like generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.
  - When life becomes so intense and complicated, our psyches search out escape ramps. Too much input, too much negative exposure, and too many choices can trigger a not-so-healthy coping response.
- *The Paradox of Choice.* More choices might afford objectively better results, but they won't make you happy. Obama just wears gray or blue suits, because he has other decisions to make.
- *Too Much "Stuff".* Clothes we never wear, books we won't read, toys that are unused, and gadgets that don't see the light of day.
  - All extra stuff produces reactive, anxious, and negative thoughts.
  - Everything seems important and urgent.
- *The Negativity Bias.* Negative stimuli produces more neural activity than do equally intense positive ones. They are also perceived more easily and quickly. This means you are hardwired to overthink, worry, and view situations more negatively than they are in reality.
- **Mindfulness requires retraining your brain to stay out of the mental clutter from the future and focus instead on the present moment.**

## Mental Declutter Habit #1: Focused Deep Breathing

- If you want to take over your breathing, you have that power.
- A change in breathing is often the first sign that our thoughts are overwhelming and stressful. When we feel anxious, depressed, rushed, or upset, we may experience rapid breathing or shortness of breath.
- Keep in mind:
  - Sit up straighter to allow more room for your lungs to take in oxygen.
  - Be conscious of breathing through your nose rather than your mouth.
  - When you inhale, use abdominal breathing.
  - Pay attention to the difference between shallow breathing (stops at the chest) and abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing (filling the lower lobes of the lungs).
- *Slow, deep, rhythmic breathing.* This stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system, reduces your heart rate, relaxes your muscles, calms your mind, and normalizes brain function.
- Shift awareness away from worry and quieting the inner dialog in your brain.

### Summary of Deep Nose Breathing

- Boost nitric oxide, immune-boosting molecule produced in the sinuses during nose breathing.
- Improve the quality of your blood through eliminating toxins and increased oxygenation.
- Assist digestive system.
- Increase oxygenation.
- Better abdominal organs through increased circulation.
- Basically it's good.

### Steps

- Determine a time of day to practice deep breathing. (After brushing your teeth in the morning?)
- Set a setting for your breathing practice in a quiet space where you won't be distracted.
- Set a timer for 10 minutes.
- Sit on the floor with a pillow in a meditative position, or in a chair with your spin straight and feet planted on the floor.
- Inhale slowly through your nose until your lungs are filled to capacity, allowing your stomach to push out on inhalation.
- At the end of the inhalation, pause for a count of two.
- Exhale slowly, smoothly, and completely.

## Mental Declutter Habit #2: Meditation

- Meditation is simply exercise for the brain.
- *Most practices begin with the same steps--sitting quietly, focusing attention on your breath, and dismissing any distractions that come your way.*
- We suggest meditation as a tool to help you train your mind and control your thoughts, both when you are sitting in meditation and when you aren't.
- The key to finding satisfaction with meditation is simply to practice. By making a daily commitment to meditation, you will improve your skills and discover how the mental, physical, and emotional benefits increase over time.
- On the days she meditates, she is less anxious and agitated and more focused in her work, especially with writing.
- Increased ability to stay in the present moment and redirect herself back to the task at hand whenever she feels tempted by a potential distraction.
- *Meditation is a lot like doing reps at a gym. It strengthens your attention muscle.*
- Benefits: Productivity, focus, decreases stress, brainpower, improves the symptoms of depression and anxiety, thicken the learning and memory areas of the brain.

## Steps

- Select a quiet, calm space for your meditation practice where you can close the door to be completely alone.
- Determine a specific time of day for your practice.
- Try not to recline as you meditate, since you might fall asleep.
- Remove all distractions.
- Close your eyes, or keep them open with a downward focused gaze, then take a few deep cleansing breaths through your nose.
- Focus your attention on the sensation of breathing, perhaps even mentally thinking the word "in" as you inhale and "out" as you exhale.
- Other thoughts: Don't pay attention, just try to concentrate on your breathing.
- *You'll likely notice other perceptions and sensations like sounds, physical discomfort, emotions. Simply notice these, and then return to the sensation of breathing.*
- *Your goal is to increasingly become the witness to all sounds, sensations, emotions, and thoughts as they arise and pass away. View them as though you are observing them from a distance without judgment or internal comment.*
- Rather than your mind taking control and running away whenever a thought or distraction occurs, you eventually gain more and more control of your mind and your ability to redirect it back to the present.

- With practice, you won't need to constantly redirect your thoughts. Thoughts begin to drop away naturally, and your mind opens up to the immense stillness and vastness of just being present.
- "The gap": the silent space between thoughts. When you become more practiced, you'll find the gap opens wider and more frequently, and you can rest in it for longer periods of time.
- Early, you might think that you are constantly redirecting your thoughts, noticing your physical discomforts, and wondering why you're bothering with the practice at all.
- You can write down thoughts on your mental state.

## Mental Declutter Habit #3: Reframe All Negative Thoughts

- Evolution has shaped our brains to suffer psychologically: to compare, evaluate, criticize ourselves, to focus on what we're lacking, be dissatisfied with what we have, and to imagine frightening scenarios, most of which will never happen.
- Strategies
  - *Be the Watcher.* Observing your thoughts rather than attaching to them disempowers the thoughts and the emotions they foster.
  - *Name that Thought.* Acknowledge that your thoughts are thoughts, not reality.
  - *Just say no.* "Stop!" out loud (vocalizing reinforces the interruption), and then visualize a heavy metal wall slamming down in front of your runaway thoughts.
  - *The Rubber Band Trick.* If you get stuck in negative thinking, pop the rubber band on your wrist. This physical action interrupts the flow of negative thought.
  - *Know Your Triggers.* Pay attention to common worries and anxieties you brood about.
  - *Distract Yourself.* Do something that will occupy your mind so there's no room for the negative thoughts. Do some multiplication or try to memorize a poem.

## Mental Declutter Habit #4: Teach Your Old Mind New Tricks

- *Challenge the Thought and Replace It.* Oftentimes, these thoughts are wildly exaggerated. They are not the truth, or at least not the whole truth. If you think you are a loser, be truthful that you've done plenty of things well and have been successful on many occasions.
  - Challenge these negative thoughts whenever they occur. *This simply means coming up with a concrete example that contradicts the thought by reminding yourself of a positive event or a previous win.*
  - Use positive reviews and positive reminders. They might feel awkward at first, but you'll train yourself to interrupt those cycles of negative thinking.
- *Practice Acceptance.* Sometimes, it's the thoughts and feelings about these challenging situations that are often far worse than the solution itself.
  - When you struggle against the reality of a bad situation, you're adding another layer of suffering to your psyche. *You can't worry of guilt yourself into a solution. Instead, you need a clear head and a calm mind.*
  - *When you find yourself struggling, say "I accept this situation is happening."*
  - You can: improve it, seek out anything positive you can learn from it, and find ways to get support as you are enduring it.
- *Take Mindful Action.* Overthinking is pointless, so why not turn that energy into structured thinking and then action?
  - Writing, practicing an instrument, constructing something by hand, painting, working on a complex problem, studying, memorizing something, practicing a speech, and designing something from scratch.
- *Set a Worry Timer.* Set a timer for 10 to 15 minute and allow yourself to stress over whatever enters your mind. You can write things down in a journal.

# Decluttering Your Life Obligations

## The Importance of Core Values

- We have more information, data, and material possessions available to us, but this doesn't come with instructions on how to manage it.
- Grandparents: No time-saving technology, but they weren't inundated with the stream of information and deluge of choices that we experience every minute of the day.
- *Define Your Core Values.*
- Why is this important?
  - Your core values can serve as a measuring stick for all your choices and decisions in life, keeping you focused on the person you want to be and the life you wish to lead.
  - By living in alignment with your values, you create the best environment for happiness, peace, and clear thinking.
  - Core values form a foundation for your life that endures through time, life difficulties, and major changes.
  - One of Barrie's core values is freedom and flexibility. Once she defined this value, she didn't want to pursue a traditional 9-to-5 job because she wouldn't be happy.
  - *Values act as our compass to put us back on course every single day, so that day after day, we're moving in the direction that takes us closer and closer to the definition of the "best" life we could possibly live. The "best" is your own ideal, but generally as you get closer to this ideal, you'll enjoy increasingly positive shades of "better" even if you never reach "best". And this makes sense because many results in life exist on a continuum.*

## Strategy #1: Identify your Core Values

- Competence. A sufficiency of means for the necessities and conveniences of life. Having requisite or adequate ability or qualities.
- Inquisitiveness: Given to inquiry, research, or asking questions, eager for knowledge, intellectually curious. Unduly or inappropriately curious, prying.
- Hacker: An expert at programming and solving problems with a computer. Automates things. Computer programming must be a hobby, something done for fun, not out of a sense of duty or for the money. [Reference](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/hacker.html)
- Candor: The quality of being open and honest in expression; frankness. Freedom from bias, impartiality.
- Tenacity: The quality of holding fast, persistent, and the quality or property of holding together firmly.
- Wittiness: Mental sharpness, keen intelligence, and a natural aptitude for using words and ideas in a quick and inventive way to create humor.

- Start with the area of your life where you feel the biggest disconnect. This is where you likely feel the most internal pain and mental agitation.

## Strategy #1: Clarify Your Life Priorities

- How much time per day do you feel you waste on activities unrelated to your core values?
- How are you spending your money unconsciously?
- How are you interacting with the people you care about unconsciously?
- How do you make career decisions (do you have a predetermined plan or do you spend most of your day in "reaction mode")?

### Seven Main Life Areas

- Career
- Family
- Marriage (or love partnership)
- Spiritual/personal growth/self-improvement
- Leisure/social
- Life management
- Health and fitness

- 98 hours per week (minus sleep, hygiene, and eating). In an ideal world, how would you prioritize those seven key areas of your life?
- When you change priorities, you have to give up something in a day. You have to create new and challenging habits, and take the difficult necessary actions.
- Over time, you won't miss those old habits, choices, and behaviors--and your life will flow more easily because you are living authentically, true to your values and priorities.

### Exercise #3a: Focus on Mindful Goal Setting

- Contentedness in the present moment.
- The ability to be in the present moment is a major component of mental wellness.
- Thich Nhat Hanh: Every moment in your life, every breath, every step you take, should be consciously experienced as a moment of joyous arrival.
- *You can be content right now if you choose to see all of the good and beauty around you in the present moment.*
- *Longing and struggling against "what is" causes suffering. Wishing for more, for something different, for something better at the expense of contentment in the moment robs us of life.*
- You need to focus on the future still, because change and transformation will happen to you whether or not you decide to focus on it.
- Change is a constant of life, whether we are sitting in the lotus position or whether we are wringing our hands about some imagined future outcome. So we might as well create our futures mindfully.
- *View the process of creating and reaching your goals as a place for happiness and contentment. Rather than holding back happiness while you await an outcome, enjoy every step along the path. Every revelation, every small action toward your goals should be savored and celebrated.*

### Strategy #3b: Create Quarterly S.M.A.R.T. Goals

- *Specific:* Who, what, where, when, which, and why. When you reach these milestones (date, location, and objective), you'll know for certain you have achieved your goal.
- *Measurable.* Defined with precise times, amounts, or other units. "How many?"
- *Attainable.*
- *Relevant.* Focus on what you truly desire.
- *Time-bound.* Specific deadlines.

### Ex:

- Career: "I will acquire five new projects for my Web design consultancy through referrals, networking, and social media marketing campaigns within two months."
- Family: "I will strengthen my bond with my family by taking them for a vacation at least once in six months. This will be accomplished by setting aside an hour each month during my review session and planning out future trip ideas."
- Marriage (or love partnership): "I will identify three things I really love about my partner, and tell her about them on Friday night. This will be done by scheduling a 30-minute block on Tuesday so I can reminisce about all the good times we've shared together."
- Spiritual/ personal growth/ self-improvement: "I will take five minutes each day to give thanks for everything that's good in my life. I will develop this habit by setting aside time right before my lunch to remember what’s important."
- Leisure/ social: "I will dedicate three hours every week to learn and practice watercolor painting. This will be done by eliminating unimportant habits like watching TV."
- Life Management: I will save 10% of every paycheck nd invest it in index funds through my 401k.
- Health and fitness: "I will work out a minimum of 30 minutes per day, three days per week by December 31."
- Try: 3 month goals. Lengthy goals are often demotivating. When you know an outcome is months away, it's easy to procrastinate on taking consistent action.
- Weekly review. Once a week, look at the next seven days and schedule the activities/projects you'd like to accomplish.
  - Answer these questions.
    - What are my personal obligations?
    - What are my priority projects?
    - How much time do I have?
  - Schedule project tasks. Map out the next seven days. Look at the list for each goal and schedule time
  - Process captured ideas.
    - Take action on it?
    - Schedule a time when you'll follow up on it. If not actionable, put the action into an archive folder that's reviewed every month.
- *When you plan out each week, you create a sense of urgency, making it more likely you will follow up on each goal.*

### Take Action on Your Goals

- *Turn your goal into a project.* Look at the target date and work your way backward. Visualize reaching this milestone, what are the specific steps you completed to get to this point?
- *Schedule time to work on goals.*
- *Turn goals into priority tasks.*
- *Schedule time for single actions.*
- *Review Your Goals.* This is why you should review your "goal project" on a daily basis and make sure you're hitting every important milestone.
  - *It doesn't matter how busy you are, if you aren't reviewing your goals every day, you will be less likely to succeed.*
- *Evaluate Your Quarterly Goals.* People don't review their goals to see if they're actually worth pursuing. That's why it's important to evaluate your goals every three months, make sure they are aligned with your life purpose, and then create new goals based on what you've learned.
  - Have I attained the desired outcome?
  - What were the successful and unsuccessful strategies?
  - Did I put 100 percent of my effort towards completing these goals? If not, why?
  - Have I achieved results consistent with my efforts?
  - Should I create a similar goal for the next quarter?
  - What goals should I eliminate or alter?
  - Is there anything new I'd like to try?

### Connect Goals to Passions

- We all get in the occasional rut. We accept less than our dreams. We stay in jobs that don't inspire us or make us happy. All of this angst adds to our mental clutter and distraction.
- The reality is that your mental health can be negatively impacted when you feel unfulfilled with your work.
- *We spend huge chunks of our lives working, so the decision you make about your job will have the potential to make or break your overall happiness.*

#### Step 1: Write a vision.

"I live in an interesting, progressive, vibrant city where I can enjoy nature, the arts, culture, great food, and like-minded people. I’m working in a career I love where I help people, utilizing my coaching and interpersonal skills, as well as my writing and creative skills."

"My work is flexible and allows me the freedom to travel and work from anywhere. My income continues to increase, but I do not allow my career to create imbalance in my life."

"I am in a relationship that is loving, respectful, and mutually supportive with a smart, creative, funny, kind, and ethical man. I have a network of close and supportive friends and family with whom I regularly spend time, and I have a loving, positive relationship with each of my three young adult children. I frequently spend time in nature, and travel to new locations several times a year. I remain active, energetic, and health conscious with every passing year, and I remain open to new opportunities and possibilities for my life."

She achieved this by moving to a new city, building an online business related to personal development and helping others, going on several amazing trips, and nurturing her relationships, health, and freedom.

#### Step 2: Revisit your current life.

If you feel yourself focusing too much on what you don't like about your life, then take a look at your current life to see how much of it matches the vision from the previous exercise.

Write a list of everything in your work that you do enjoy or view as positive.

#### Step 3: Investigate Yourself.

- Random personal assessments.

#### Step 4: Start reading.

- Read everything you can about your interests or ideas for potential passions.

#### Step 5: Narrow Your Search.

- Figure out what training is needed, what salary.

### Step 6: Find a mentor.

- Find one or two people who are doing what you want to do, and are doing it well. Reach out to them.

#### Step 7: Brainstorm and write.

- Think about all of the possible action steps you'll need to take to move the needle towards living your passion. Make one long list of actions, then go back and prioritize and order the list.

#### Step 8: Take the first action.

- Resume, signing up for a training class, or making a call to someone.

#### Step 9: Decide on a test drive.
#### Step 10: Consider other people.
#### Step 11: Save money.
#### Step 12: Plan your income.
#### Step 13: Deal with your current job.
#### Step 14: Stay motivated with action.

- The effort of working toward your passion is sometimes as satisfying as the outcome.
- *Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.*

## TODO: Decluttering Your Relationships

### The Negative Impact of Bad Relationships

## Decluttering Your Surroundings

### The Value of Decluttering Your Surroundings

- "Multiple stimuli present in the visual field at the same time compete for neural representation by mutually suppressing their evoked activity throughout the visual cortex, providing a neural correlate for the limited processing capacity of the visual system.
- Your body is so busy trying to process all the visual stimuli that you can't fully enjoy the moment.
- *Set up a staging area.* Find a place where you'll stage all of the items you want to store elsewhere or give away.
- *Get boxes for the staging area.*
- *Have a timer, notebook, and pen ready.*
- *Set up a schedule. 10 minute declutter schedule means you're adding a new habit to your day.* Make it a habit like brushing your teeth.
- *Begin where you spend most of your time.*
- *Determine your system.*
- *Avoid indecision.* Only put the absolute keepers back in the spaces you've decluttered. Get rid of anything you know for sure you don't want or need.
- *Work quickly.* 10 minutes, so there will be an urgency for yourself.
- *Tell your family.*
- *Enjoy the process.* The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past. If you have a strong attachment to the past, whether through your thinking or your clutter, you cause yourself suffering.

### Simplify Your Digital Life

- If you add up the time spent on each digital device each day, then you probably have a closer relationship with the virtual world than you have with your spouse, children, or friends.
- Is this really how you want to live your life?
- Document your digital activities throughout the day.
- Take 10 minutes to declutter your phone and computer.
- Digital value system:
  - How much time each day is absolutely necessary for me to spend on my devices for my job?
  - Am I in a job that requires me to spend more time than I want behind my computer?
  - How could I interact face-to-face with people in my work more often?
  - How much time do I want to spend on my home computer doing work?
  - When I have downtime, what are the top five best ways I should use it?
  - How can I deal with the urges to "surf the net" when I really don't want to?

### Simplify Your Activities

- What happened to a world in which we can sit with the people we love and have slow conversations about the state of our heart and soul, conversations that slowly unfold, conversations with pregnant pauses and silences that we are in no rush to fill?
- Acknowledge that busyness is contributing to your mental clutter and accepting that less really can be more.
- *Prioritize your daily priorities.*
- *Purge your commitments.*
- *Focus on three important daily goals.*
- *Build in sacred time.* Give yourself time during the day to do absolutely nothing.
- *Re-examine your children's schedule.*
- *Leave work on time.*
- *Take a digital sabbatical.*
- *Harness the power of flow and focus.*

### Simplify Your Distractions

- Distraction breeds procrastination, but procrastination is also the result of fear--fear of failure or fear of success.
- We procrastinate because we dread difficult tasks.
- If you procrastinate for 1 hour a day, that's 7 hours a week, about 52 full workdays a year to procrastination.

### Simplify Your Actions

- Shift your perspective to see drinking your tea as the only important thing in the world.
- Eat meals mindfully. Notice the food, the colors, smells, textures. When you are aware of feeling full, cease eating.
- Clean your house mindfully. "If I am incapable of washing dishes joyfully, if I want to finish them quickly so I can go and have a cup of tea, then I will be incapable of drinking the tea joyfully."
- Once you remove judgment, attachments, and fear from the equation, fitness can be something to look forward to rather than an obligation you dread.

*Your mind is the basis of everything you experience and of every contribution you make to the lives of others. Given this fact, it makes sense to train it.*

- Focused breathing to detach from intrusive thoughts and emotion.
- Reframing and challenging thoughts to learn to take charge of your thinking and diminish the power thoughts have over you.
- When you identify your core values, you create boundaries for your choices and actions so you don’t give yourself more reason to ruminate and worry.
- Once you clarify your life priorities, you don’t waste your time on things that will later cause you regret or mental suffering.
- When you set goals based on your values and priorities, you set the stage for focused action and self-esteem that keeps you feeling energized.
- When you seek out and live your passion, you infuse your goals with authenticity, purpose, and joy, leaving little room for negative thinking.
- By being more present and mindful in your relationships, you prevent many of the conflicts that come with human interaction, minimizing the resulting mental distress and increasing fulfillment with the relationship.
- When you keep your home and your digital world clean, organized, and streamlined, you remove distractions that pull you away from your values, priorities, and goals.
- By making the decision to cut back on tasks and obligations, you reduce stress, allowing more “space” to be present and attentive to life.
- As you focus on the task at hand and involve yourself in “flow” activities, you transcend the mental chatter in your head to become one with the activity, fostering feelings of joy and deep satisfaction.
- When you tackle procrastination and learn to quickly take the first step, you circumvent the anxiety that comes with putting things off.
- By applying mindfulness to all of the daily activities of life, from dishwashing to exercise, you clear your mind of all but the only true reality in life— the present moment.
