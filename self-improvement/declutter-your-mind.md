- Health and fitness: "I will work out a minimum of 30 minutes per day, three days per week by December 31."
- Try: 3 month goals. Lengthy goals are often demotivating. When you know an outcome is months away, it's easy to procrastinate on taking consistent action.
- Weekly review. Once a week, look at the next seven days and schedule the activities/projects you'd like to accomplish.
  - Answer these questions.
    - What are my personal obligations?
    - What are my priority projects?
    - How much time do I have?
  - Schedule project tasks. Map out the next seven days. Look at the list for each goal and schedule time
  - Process captured ideas.
    - Take action on it?
    - Schedule a time when you'll follow up on it. If not actionable, put the action into an archive folder that's reviewed every month.
- *When you plan out each week, you create a sense of urgency, making it more likely you will follow up on each goal.*

### Take Action on Your Goals

- *Turn your goal into a project.* Look at the target date and work your way backward. Visualize reaching this milestone, what are the specific steps you completed to get to this point?
- *Schedule time to work on goals.*
- *Turn goals into priority tasks.*
- *Schedule time for single actions.*
- *Review Your Goals.* This is why you should review your "goal project" on a daily basis and make sure you're hitting every important milestone.
  - *It doesn't matter how busy you are, if you aren't reviewing your goals every day, you will be less likely to succeed.*
- *Evaluate Your Quarterly Goals.* People don't review their goals to see if they're actually worth pursuing. That's why it's important to evaluate your goals every three months, make sure they are aligned with your life purpose, and then create new goals based on what you've learned.
  - Have I attained the desired outcome?
  - What were the successful and unsuccessful strategies?
  - Did I put 100 percent of my effort towards completing these goals? If not, why?
  - Have I achieved results consistent with my efforts?
  - Should I create a similar goal for the next quarter?
  - What goals should I eliminate or alter?
  - Is there anything new I'd like to try?

### Connect Goals to Passions

- We all get in the occasional rut. We accept less than our dreams. We stay in jobs that don't inspire us or make us happy. All of this angst adds to our mental clutter and distraction.
- The reality is that your mental health can be negatively impacted when you feel unfulfilled with your work.
- *We spend huge chunks of our lives working, so the decision you make about your job will have the potential to make or break your overall happiness.*

#### Step 1: Write a vision.

"I live in an interesting, progressive, vibrant city where I can enjoy nature, the arts, culture, great food, and like-minded people. I’m working in a career I love where I help people, utilizing my coaching and interpersonal skills, as well as my writing and creative skills."

"My work is flexible and allows me the freedom to travel and work from anywhere. My income continues to increase, but I do not allow my career to create imbalance in my life."

"I am in a relationship that is loving, respectful, and mutually supportive with a smart, creative, funny, kind, and ethical man. I have a network of close and supportive friends and family with whom I regularly spend time, and I have a loving, positive relationship with each of my three young adult children. I frequently spend time in nature, and travel to new locations several times a year. I remain active, energetic, and health conscious with every passing year, and I remain open to new opportunities and possibilities for my life."

She achieved this by moving to a new city, building an online business related to personal development and helping others, going on several amazing trips, and nurturing her relationships, health, and freedom.

#### Step 2: Revisit your current life.

If you feel yourself focusing too much on what you don't like about your life, then take a look at your current life to see how much of it matches the vision from the previous exercise.

Write a list of everything in your work that you do enjoy or view as positive.

#### Step 3: Investigate Yourself.

- Random personal assessments.

#### Step 4: Start reading.

- Read everything you can about your interests or ideas for potential passions.

#### Step 5: Narrow Your Search.

- Figure out what training is needed, what salary.

### Step 6: Find a mentor.

- Find one or two people who are doing what you want to do, and are doing it well. Reach out to them.

#### Step 7: Brainstorm and write.

- Think about all of the possible action steps you'll need to take to move the needle towards living your passion. Make one long list of actions, then go back and prioritize and order the list.

#### Step 8: Take the first action.

- Resume, signing up for a training class, or making a call to someone.

#### Step 9: Decide on a test drive.
#### Step 10: Consider other people.
#### Step 11: Save money.
#### Step 12: Plan your income.
#### Step 13: Deal with your current job.
#### Step 14: Stay motivated with action.

- The effort of working toward your passion is sometimes as satisfying as the outcome.
- *Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.*

## TODO: Decluttering Your Relationships

### The Negative Impact of Bad Relationships

## Decluttering Your Surroundings

### The Value of Decluttering Your Surroundings

- "Multiple stimuli present in the visual field at the same time compete for neural representation by mutually suppressing their evoked activity throughout the visual cortex, providing a neural correlate for the limited processing capacity of the visual system.
- Your body is so busy trying to process all the visual stimuli that you can't fully enjoy the moment.
- *Set up a staging area.* Find a place where you'll stage all of the items you want to store elsewhere or give away.
- *Get boxes for the staging area.*
- *Have a timer, notebook, and pen ready.*
- *Set up a schedule. 10 minute declutter schedule means you're adding a new habit to your day.* Make it a habit like brushing your teeth.
- *Begin where you spend most of your time.*
- *Determine your system.*
- *Avoid indecision.* Only put the absolute keepers back in the spaces you've decluttered. Get rid of anything you know for sure you don't want or need.
- *Work quickly.* 10 minutes, so there will be an urgency for yourself.
- *Tell your family.*
- *Enjoy the process.* The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past. If you have a strong attachment to the past, whether through your thinking or your clutter, you cause yourself suffering.

- Is this really how you want to live your life?
- Document your digital activities throughout the day.
- Take 10 minutes to declutter your phone and computer.
- Digital value system:
  - How much time each day is absolutely necessary for me to spend on my devices for my job?

  - How could I interact face-to-face with people in my work more often?
  - How much time do I want to spend on my home computer doing work?
  - When I have downtime, what are the top five best ways I should use it?
  - How can I deal with the urges to "surf the net" when I really don't want to?

### Simplify Your Activities

- What happened to a world in which we can sit with the people we love and have slow conversations about the state of our heart and soul, conversations that slowly unfold, conversations with pregnant pauses and silences that we are in no rush to fill?
- Acknowledge that busyness is contributing to your mental clutter and accepting that less really can be more.
- *Prioritize your daily priorities.*

### Simplify Your Distractions

- Distraction breeds procrastination, but procrastination is also the result of fear--fear of failure or fear of success.
- We procrastinate because we dread difficult tasks.
- If you procrastinate for 1 hour a day, that's 7 hours a week, about 52 full workdays a year to procrastination.

### Simplify Your Actions

- Shift your perspective to see drinking your tea as the only important thing in the world.
- Eat meals mindfully. Notice the food, the colors, smells, textures. When you are aware of feeling full, cease eating.
- Clean your house mindfully. "If I am incapable of washing dishes joyfully, if I want to finish them quickly so I can go and have a cup of tea, then I will be incapable of drinking the tea joyfully."
- Once you remove judgment, attachments, and fear from the equation, fitness can be something to look forward to rather than an obligation you dread.

*Your mind is the basis of everything you experience and of every contribution you make to the lives of others. Given this fact, it makes sense to train it.*

- Focused breathing to detach from intrusive thoughts and emotion.
