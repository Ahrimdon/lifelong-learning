## The Science of Being Lucky

- Luck is often a convenient substitute to allow us to feel more in control and less subject to the realities of chaos theory.
- Luck is an explanation for why good and bad things happen to us, an attribute we use to give meaning to random events.
- When we are feeling lucky, we may tend to take on extra risk unnecessarily. And when other people are included in the impact of our hopeful choices, we can harm others through our deception.
- Superstitions: anything which improves confidence can actually improve performance.

### The Illusion of Control

- The locus of control: the strength of a person's belief that they determine the experiences and outcomes of their own life.
- Gambler's fallacy/apophenia: since X happened, then X shouldn't happen again.
- Stable of luck: people are consistently either lucky or unlucky, almost as if luck itself isn't so much an external force, but rather a personality trait.
- "Only 40% succeed, but I'm luckier than most people, so I think I'll be in the 40%."
- An external locus of control combined with a stable view on luck will result in being "lucky" because these individuals will be looking for more opportunities.
- *Realizing that you have the power to change your reality is what will lead to situations we would call lucky.*

### As Seen on Oprah

- Visualize/repeat affirmations.
- Positive visualization re: putting a ball into the hoop.
- Mental rehearsal can make you readier, more open, more aware, and more willing to jump into situations you might not have otherwise.
- Creating "good luck" in our lives is more than about creating the conditions for positive things to happen to us.
- Embrace the process or journey of reaching your goals, rather than focusing on the destination.

### Coincidence and Serendipity

- *Serendipity: seemingly improbable occurrences and positive personal feelings about them.*
- The real difference between status quo and serendipity. Being open, positive, and proactive makes people more likely to recognize and appreciate an opportunity so that they will take advantage of the potential good fortune they receive.
- Doing new things with different people constantly will all but guarantee a steady flow of opportunities that could be seen as serendipitous in hindsight.
- *Coincidences--the full spectrum of improbable occurrences, good or bad.*
- When you begin to look at coincidences as low probabilities, it actually begins to seem inevitable that you'll experience some from time to time. When you think about all the people you personally know, chances are you'll bump into somebody you know, somewhere, at some point.

### Traits for Luck

- "Luck is where opportunity meets preparation."
- People who are lucky are in a certain state of mind that makes them more aware of lucky occurrences.
- *Extroversion.* Assertive, energetic, and talkative. You will have more lucky breaks when you meet ten people a day versus none.
- *Openness.* When someone demonstrates a high level of openness, they are relaxed about life and are ready to experience new circumstances. They are not as risk-averse as others. They are the people who just make themselves aware of opportunities.
- *Neuroticism.* Those who are not neurotic, and are calmer and relaxed, means they are highly aware of their surroundings without being anxious.
- Being proactive: you actually have to get engaged in life. You have to search for opportunities, because they will not land in your lap if you are not out there seeking them.
- Do you skip taking a vacation because you are afraid of the small chance the plane could crash with you on it?
- Luck comes to people who take the job, go on the date, and do it the first time.

### The Four Factors

- *Be open to new experiences.* They tend to be relaxed about life, adopting the general attitude that everything is all right. They have lower levels of anxiety than their unlucky counterparts, which frees them to not only expect good things, but to actively look for them.
- *Listen to your gut.* Unlucky people usually have analysis paralysis. Ex: Steve Jobs takes a calligraphy class.
- *Positive expectations.* Optimism gives lucky people more "grit". Perseverance builds resilience, which allows a person to hold fast, giving more time for events to work out in their favor. They understand that they are capable of handling what life throws at them, and this allows them to have a more relaxed attitude.
  - Willing to reach out for help during times of crisis.
  - Castaway.
- *Transform bad luck into good.* The ability to face adversity and take control of the situation, not be buried by it. Trust that life has prepared you to handle whatever comes along. Or if a situation is outside your experience, know that others can help and be willing to accept their support. Actively look for the unseen opportunity in misfortune.
- *Make your own luck.* If these scenarios don't come naturally, attach yourself to someone who knows how to work a room, and ask them to include you.

### "Strategic Luck Planning"

- Even if you are a quiet person, all you need to do is to go where the events flow fastest. Surround yourself with a churning mass of people and things will inevitably happen.
- When you meet someone, ask about their life, their goals, their passions.
- Be willing to be busy. Juggle as many ventures as you can, take up new hobbies, join new classes. One of them could be your gateway to your lucky break.

### What About Bad Luck?

- Highest levels of magical thinking were also those with the highest levels of stress.
- Magical thinking is a shield from the harsh truths of the world. If something negative has happened, it was for a reason, or there was a greater purpose behind it.
- *We create beliefs in hosts, because we don't like believing that the universe is random.*
- The discovery of LSD: He planned it first on animals.
