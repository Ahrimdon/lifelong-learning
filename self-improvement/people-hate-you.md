## #5. It's Not What You Said, It's What You Didn't Say

*So What's the Problem?*

This is literally the most frequent social mistake I see in my day to day. You didn't respond to the party invitation. You didn't reply to their funny text with a smiley. You didn't wish them a happy birthday. Now they're bitter and you're confused because, well, who would ever assume that _silence_ is an insult?

*Lots of people. In fact, to certain personality types, not speaking is the most bitter insult possible.*

*Think of it this way: If you apply for a job, which is worse -- a rejection letter, or no reply at all? The former is bad, but the latter is dismissive, and that's a thousand times worse.*

That's how some people take your failure to speak to them -- like you didn't even resume before tossing it in the trash.

Hate is not the opposite of love. Apathy is. For many people, you'd be better off telling them to fuck off, because at least you're acknowledging that they matter.

*So Keep in Mind...*

This is about power. Everything is.

The offended parties are assuming you're so high and mighty that they don't even rate a response, and that your silence is a kind of power play intended to let them know that.

## #4. You Accidentally Asserted Power Over Them

*So What's the Problem?*

You just asserted your power over him. You didn't do it on purpose. But you did it anyway, and it's the sort of thing we accidenally do all the time.

In this particular example, you told a story that involved A) you having sex, B) doing it in a car, and C) an expensive clean-up bill. Meanwhile, the guy you told the story to is a single dad who A) hasn't had sex in 3 years, B) can't afford a car, and C) can't waste $200 because he has a kid.

So in his eyes, you're like that douchebag at your high school reunion who desperately tries to wedge a dozen stealth boasts into the conversation. This guy is a douchebag because he's clearly trying to remind you that he is in a higher social and economic position than you -- he has the kind of "problems" you would kill to have. He is, in other words, trying to assert his power over you. That's why we hate people like him.

*So Keep in Mind...*

*This unspoken power dynamic is always at play, whether you acknowledge it or not.* In any conversation between two people, one person is going to be more successful than the other, or more attractive, or smarter, or physically stronger, etc. -- there area all of these invisible "ranks" where one of you has risen over the other on society's ladder. Both of you are aware of them, but _neither of you is allowed to mention them._

For many of us who are insecure about our "rank", the subject is basically an open wound. So not only must the subject be avoided, but courtesy demands the _higher person has to pretend to be the lower_. This is why pretty female comedians like Tina Fey pretend to be ugly and why Jennifer Lawrence has to make constant jokes about how gross and ugly she is, just minutes after posing for yet another magazine cover.

The thing you have to remember is the fact that it accidentally means nothing. Any interaction that results in other people feeling worse about themselves will still count against you in your "Why I don't like talking to this person" score.

## #3. They Think You Owe Them.

*So Whats the Problem?*

There's a really good chance that the last person who got annoyed with you for seemingly no reason at all did it because you failed to pay a debt you didn't even know you owed. There's this weird thing where in most relationships, and maybe in every relationship at one point or another, where both parties think the other side is in debt to them.

Wife: "That guy was a lonely mess before I came along, who knows where he'd be if it wasn't for me rescuing him!" Husband: "I'm the breadwinner, I gave her this nice house, if not for me she could have wound up with some scumbag who beats her!"

Both of them think they're the martyr in the relationship, and each is shocked and pissed off when they find out the other person is working from a different balance sheet.

Workplace: Everyone in your department thinks they keep the place afloat, while the boss thinks you're a bunch of slackers for whom the company generously puts food on the table. You're shocked when the company announces layoffs: ("Where's the loyalty?"), and the boss is shocked and insulted when you quit ("That ungrateful bastard!").

*So Keep in Mind...*

The key is that in every case, the other person desperately wants yo to be in debt to them. That would given them power over you. But, they can't be upfront about how or why they perceive you to be in their debt. They just get angry when you fail to "pay."

## #2. You Wasted Their Time

*So What's the Problem?*

Your boss and your friend was way too busy to put up with your BS. But due to the complicated power dynamics at play, they weren't allowed to openly say so.

After all, that would be effecively saying that they've prioritized some other interaction over yours. That would mean that A) they have the power to dictate your interactions and B) other people have power to get in line ahead of you. "I'm important and busy, and you are just one of the lesser peasants begging for my attention."

Because at the exact same moment they made you feel powerless, they also feel like the powerless party, because they're so besieged by people making demands on their time.

Nobody will feel sorry for people who are "too busy" for them. More probably, they'd be annoyed and interpret it as one of those stealth boasts ("Boohoo! I'm too famous! Waah!").

*There's no good way for a busy person to tell you they don't have time for you. It always comes with the implication that they're a bigger deal than you are. And as we established earlier, the only thing worse is to say nothing.*

*So Keep in Mind...*

The person who is being terse with you is often in an impossible situation. They're coming off as flaunting their power to screen you, while from their POV, they have no power at all. 

If that sounds like they're making you pay for someone else's behavior, well they are. THat's the way it works -- prior offenses count, even when it was someone else that commited them. The cashier at Arby's got annoyed when you pointed out that their logo looks like a dick because she hears that joke six times a day. *Remember: You are nothing more than one link in somebody else's chain of human interactions A chain that occasionally rubs them raw.*

## #1. You Assumed That Because You Were OK With a Situation, Everybody Was

The reason why the classic male/femal conflict about not putting the toilet seat down is a sore subject in some couples is that it demonstrates that the man simply isnt' factoring the woman's needs at all.

*It's not that he intentionally wants to make her life worse, or that he hates her or feels any negative emotion, or he disagrees on the issue, it's that he refuses to acknowledge it as an issue at all.*

*You will be on one side of a conflict that does not feel like a conflict to you, because that is the conflict. There's a great chance you'll be oblivious to it until it's too late.*

Any controversy having to do with gay marriage, or school prayer, or any social hot-button issues involves the group who's in control being baffled that any other groups are dissatisfied with the "normal" way of doing things ("Oh, so now we can't keep the ten commandments in the courthouse? But it's always been there!") In many cases, the baffled people don't feel any more malice than the guy did when he left the toilet seat up.

In many cases, they mean it honestly -- "I'm not angry at anyone, I just want to leave things the way they are. Which incidentally involves me having all of the power."

*So Keep in Mind...*

It's easier than you think to find yourself on the wrong side of this in your everyday life. You like to stay in on weekends, your SO likes going out. After a year, they give up and stop trying to get you off the sofa every Saturday. You misinterpret this as the relationship settling in, and they're so miserable that they're rehearsing their breakup speech. "But everything was going great!"

It was, for you. *You didn't perceive yourself as being in a position of power because that is the main advantage of power -- that you don't have to think about it.* You don't think about money when you're eating in a restaurant. But you sure as fuck think aboutit when you're too poor to eat.

And out of of all the pitfalls on this list, this is by far the worst, because it means that you can absolutely make other peopel hate you without lifting a finger.
