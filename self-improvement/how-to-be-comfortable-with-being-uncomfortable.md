# How to Be Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable

- Anxiety - Something that affects everyone and will come and go depending upon circumstances. When we feel worried or afraid, we can experience a series of physical symptoms in the body - heart rate, adrenaline, dizziness, sweating, nausea, and the feeling of unease/general fear.
- Anxiety is our survival instinct - we should be extremely grateful for it.
- Feeling apprehensive is normal and we can experience these "fight or flight" symptoms in response to small or imagined threats.
- Panic attacks: They can even get to be like a heart attack kind of level.
- Human mind: Philosophy, psychology, CBT, self-help, inspirational biographies.
- The comfort zone: we all have comfort zones. Stoicism: practicing adversity to develop a stronger and more resilient mindset. They would do this in many ways - eating less food, embracing the elements, practicing poverty, wearing embarrassing clothes.
- Book: Contains some mental challenges to try.

## How to Build Mental Resilience

### Stoicism

- Seneca - Letters from a Stoic. When Nero asked him to commit suicide, he accepted his fate and committed suicide without complaining.
- Epictetus - Slave. The Enchiridion - the book acts as a philosophical road map/handbook for how to live our lives and has a heavy focus on how we respond to situations.
- Marcus Aurelius - Emperor.
- ***Stoicism's golden rule: The only thing you have control over is how you respond to external events.***
  - Life is very unpredictable, and you always have a choice whether to get angry and annoyed or not.
  - Whatever you face, you can easily add fuel to the fire and make it worse by complaining and focusing on the negative. The Stoics tried to focus on the solution instead.
  - Rudeness: You can either engage with the rudeness, or you can work it more constructively.

### Buddhism

- ***Buddhism's golden rule: Our mind is the source of our suffering.*** If something is unpleasant and we're struggling to deal with it, we should blame our minds. Our minds are responsible for how we feel about everything.
- 4 Noble Truths:
  - Suffering exists.
  - Desire is the source of our suffering.
  - This suffering can be alleviated.
  - By following a balanced life and working hard, we can overcome anguish. Eightfold path - balanced life, becoming conscious of the way we speak to others, the way we think, the way we view the world and our actions.
- Eightfold path - finding balance. Not over-consuming, not over-eating, finding a healthy lifestyle with exercise, social and creative goals.
- Lotus flower: Represents how a beautiful flower can come from the murky grime. In testing conditions where hope looks lost, beauty and life can grow - "strength through adversity".

### CBT

- ***Change the way you think and you will change the way you feel.***
- Become conscious of your thinking.
  - Negative thinking and negative thoughts are normal. Everyone experiences them - but the more you try not to think about it, the stronger the thought becomes.
  - Remaining objective, or at least attempting to, will allow you to view the world slightly differently.
- Use logic to challenge your thoughts.
  - Like, anxiety from going to the dentist: Am I realistically going to die? Is it going to hurt? Yes, but not really. By using logic and rational self-talk, I can start to control my inner resistance and alter my perception on going to the dentist.
- CBT thoughts:
  - Challenge your thinking. Start by becoming conscious of any negative thoughts that crop up in your mind. When you encounter them, blast them with logic.
  - Affirmations. Powerful internal dialogue can be life-changing. "I can handle this", "I've got this".

## Challenges

- Embrace the cold: Cold shower for 10 minutes.
- Learn a language: Very hard, 1 year. Flashcards. Making a commitment to study every day was really hard but the results were worthwhile. Every step of the way there is another hurdle to deal with. The constant struggle will make you better at struggling. I'm getting more comfortable with being uncomfortable, and I know that I can apply this to other areas of my life.
- Long distance walk: Around 150 kilometers.
- Memorize a deck of cards. - by turning each card into a character with an action, you can place them in a story and it will be easier to remember. Memory Palace.
- Acupuncture session. Now this looks like something I can do. Same with cupping therapy. Perceived pain vs actual pain.
- Run a road race. Did this already.
- Solve a Rubik's cube. Hmm, not sure about this.
- Climb a mountain: Did this already.
- Become an early riser.
- Sleep in a bivouac bag. Uh I slept in a hammock already.
- No painkillers when you need it. I find that if I listen to what my body is trying to tell me, then I can get to the root of my pain quite quickly. When I figure out what is likely to have cause the pain, I try to remedy it ASAP.
- Pick a lock. Hmm.
- Eat something unfamiliar. Often, the thought of the food is worse than the actual taste. This is especially the same for insects.
- Complete an obstacle course like OCR.
- Meditate. Try to do a 30 minute one. "By starting to meditate, I have become acutely aware of how easily distracted my mind can get."

- Public speaking. Did already.
- Read a technical book. Making yourself feel stupid. A Brief History of Time, Meditations on the First Philosophy, The Quantum Universe.
- Make exercise harder - like altitude mask or weight vest.

- Whistle with fingers.
- Fasting - did already.
- Talk to a stranger - be the first to initiate things. People are a lot friendlier than I had led myself to believe and are usually keen to chat. I had assumed that no one would be receptive to this experiment, but I really did surprise myself.
