## Stopping The Internet Of Noise - A Useful Internet Back Again
[Reference](https://www.franzoni.eu/stopping-the-internet-of-noise/)

"I sometimes struggle to understand how little I'm accomplishing today with all the bandwidth I can leverage.

- *Discussing:* Usenet mailing lists. You can subscribe to a lot of different newsgroups, without needing to sign up for each of them.
  - Single application with a consistent interface, and topics were widely enforced.
- *Chatting:* IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and mIRC. Other instant messengers appeared, but Pidgin let the users just pick one client with multiple connections.
  - Easy way to get a consistent interface in a single application to chat on IRC, Google Chat, Facebook Chat.
- *Getting notified about updates.* RSS and Atom. Google Reader. "Update Sources", and all updates poured in.

### What Happened

- *Focus is lost.* Everything went around topics. Nowadays, we have people instead of topics. I'd like to hear what a great software architect has to say about software, not about other shits.
- *There are multiple platforms lacking an API.* Slack, Discord, Skype, whatever messenger app is going to be popular tomorrow. No way to integrate Facebook/Twitter into a single app.
- *Can't mark things as read.* You cannot mark a tweet or post as read, it could resurface at any time.

### Where we want to go

- *Topics.* We won't discuss about so many totally unrelated fields.
- *APIs.* Need a common API for Instant Messaging and forum-like software, so that people can use their favorite tools to organize their data sources.

### Comments

- Follow the money, the content is not the product anymore. The product is the consumer and the payment is the advertising.
- Most of the usable tools from the early internet didn't allow for advertising. More specifically, it didn't allow for things to grab your attention. All of them could have allowed for text advertisements, and many of them could have allowed for something more graphical, but none of them could force the advertising to be in your view, at least peripherally.
- Fixing this problem requires creating and incubating a new common system of compensating content providers. Advertising may still be an option, but I feel we've been down that road enough to say "it works, but it sucks". *We all pay for our content one way or another, be that tucked into the price of our purchases, our taxes, or loss of time from a colleague.* Systems like Patreon have seen moderate success, and Kickstarter has seen much more. However, both systems lack the ubiquity of an API and/or standardization into one of our protocols.
- Personally, RSS+Curating my Twitter feed is the combo I've found that keeps me updated without being overloaded. I use feedly.com to subscribe to feeds and perform a little magic and I use the application 'Reeder' to read feeds from Feedly.
- The other problem with IRC is that it's not very user friendly: there are many different networks, which implement different rules. Your IP may be banned for some reason. People can steal your nickname, etc.  While this is totally fine for internet-savvy people, I can see why regular people who just want to chat turn to alternatives.
- The issue is when the unwanted folks follow the cool kids around. This happens a lot on Reddit. People will make a subreddit with the type of community they want. Others will join. Eventually people will complain that the quality has deteriorated. Then the cool kids will start a new one and migrate there. Rinse. Repeat, ad infinitum.
- It's fine to say that, but this phenomenon is even older than the Internet. Think of the hip bar that gains a sudden influx of customers following a New York Times story. Yogi Berra remarked on this phenomenon with one of his famous quotes "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded!"
- John Dvorak once opined that social networks stop being cool when that coworker you secretly hated tries to connect.
- My own theory about why our ability to focus on what we want to on the internet is Attention Capitalism. Our attention is the latest resource to be exploited by capitalism, and each company is attempting to control what we focus on for their profit. I've noticed this trend; very little software let's me control what information I see anymore. It's almost all controlled by some algorithm making me see what they claim I want to see.
- Amazon and Facebook, to me, are symptoms of a deeper problem: Technology is still hard. We're building complex large-scale products because the non-technical consumers can't use the simple small-scale products.
- I'd like to see better moderation systems. Moderation done by people who are actually good at it rather than just upvoting or downvoting comments depending on whether they agree with them or not (moderating the moderators). Ways to mark comments as duplicates so they are all grouped into one bundle. A way to avoid the "first posts" effect, where the earlier posts are likely to be the highest rated regardless of their merits.
