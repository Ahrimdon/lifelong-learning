- Average college students learn ideas once. The best college students re-learn ideas over and over.
- Average employees write emails once. Elite novelists re-write chapters again and again.
- Average fitness enthusiasts mindlessly follow the same workout routine each week. The best athletes actively critique each repetition and constantly improve their technique. It is the revision that matters most.
- *By staying on the bus, you give yourself time to re-work and revise until you produce something unique, inspiring, and great. It’s only by staying on board that mastery reveals itself. Show up enough times to get the average ideas out of the way and every now and then genius will reveal itself.*
  - A lot of people put in 10,000 hours. Very few people put in 10,000 hours of revision. The only way to do that is to stay on the bus.

  - Art. If you want to be a great photographer, you could go on a quest to take one perfect photo each day. Or you could take 100 photos per day, learn from your mistakes, and hone your craft.
  - Strength. If you want to be stronger, you could analyze every movement and phase of your technique until you're blue in the face. Or, you could get under the bar, learn from your mistakes, and focus on doing more reps.

- There's nothing sexy or shocking about writing 2 or 3 pages per day. Nathan was simply more consistent than everyone else and, as a result, his average speed for those 253 days was much higher than most people.
- *Habit Graduation: How to Increase Your Average Speed*
  - If your average speed is eating three healthy meals per week, can you “graduate” that to one healthy meal per day?
  - If your average speed is exercising twice per month, can you “graduate” that to once per week?
  - If your job is crazy and you only talk to your old friends on the phone once every three months, can you schedule those calls into your calendar and “graduate” that habit to once per month?
- The truth is, anyone can get motivated and push themselves for one day, but very few people maintain a consistent effort every week without fail.

- ***If you want to become significantly better at anything, you have to fall in love with the process of doing it. You have to fall in love with building the identity of someone who does the work, rather than merely dreaming about the results that you want.***
