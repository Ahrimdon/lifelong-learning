## Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30?
[Reference](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html)

- On having friends:
  - Proximity.
  - Repeated, unplanned interactions.
  - A setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other.
- Workplace: competition, so people hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. Work friendships take on a transactional feel, difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins.
- Differences in professional status/income complicate matters. It's weird if your friends make a lot more or a lot less than you.
- Internal shifts:
  - Higher self-discovery, so higher self-knowledge, so you become pickier.

### Comments

- People are a sum of their life experiences. Growing older, you realize you don't need to surround yourself with people whom you don't like, no longer crave as much attention, and already stepped along many of life's stones. You also put on less of a pretense to others and care less about being liked. It's more important to be authentic and true, even if that means having less friends, than a phony with a lot of fake friends. All this has the result of making it more difficult to randomly find real friends.
- Gay people: I also think social isolation around gay people makes friendship among gay people special. Since they have to pretend to be straight, they can't talk about it unless they're around their gay friends.
- Clubs, bonding over struggles is huge.
