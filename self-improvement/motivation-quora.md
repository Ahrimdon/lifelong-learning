- "See what you can achieve by improving yourself by just 1% daily, & till what extend you can deteriorate yourself by doing the opposite: 1.01^365 = 37.8, 0.99^365 = 0.03"
- Don't be the guy that "wish they had tried."
- Suffer the pain of discipline, or suffer the pain of regret.
- Get clear on what your fire is and what energizes you.
- Create a life mantra (at least for the next month or so).
- Ask friends if they have suggestions about what your passion/strengths are.
- Write down goals and commit to them.
- Think about your purpose and your end goal.
- It is helpful to celebrate small wins.
- Commit to refreshment and recharging your batteries (hobbies, relaxation, social activities, etc.)
- Keep track of your progress. Hold yourself accountable.
- *Get started. This is often the hardest part.*
- Post visual reminders in places you think would be helpful which remind you in words or visuals of your goals & priorities.
- Get a buddy: Get someone to do it with you and/or to hold you accountable.
- Find a champion (someone who believes in you and/or your goals).
- Go on a quest to find what motivates other people in their work and life.
- *Someone once told me the definition of Hell: The last day you have on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become.*
- I don't think about it as hard work. I think about it as part of making myself into who I want to be. I want to be a hard-working person. The hard part for me is choosing and accepting what it is that I have to do. Once I've made the choice to do something, I try think about how good it must feel to be that, or how proud I might be to have done that. Make hard look easy.
- *If I fail because I lack time or talent or luck or if fate intervenes to keep me from being able to achieve a goal in the way I'd hoped, that doesn't mean I'm a failure. But if I fail because i didn't work hard enough, I'm either a half-assed quitter or lazy or stupid, none of which are what I want to be. I can only blame myself; I can't even claim I was beat or not good enough, because I didn't even try!*
- *If you wait for perfet conditions, you'll never get anything done.*
- Passion is about pushing yourself when no one else is around.
- *The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.*
- Try and fail, but don't fail to try.
- *The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do.*
- Working hard has nothing to do with your body. It is your mind and your spirit which has to grow stronger.
- If you were the person that you want to be, then what would that person do?

# 5 Surprising Tricks to Increase Your Motivation Immediately
[link](http://open.bufferapp.com/increase-your-motivation-tips/)

1. *Strike a high-power pose for a jolt of confidence.* High-power: Having your body open. Chest out, arms spread, no slouch. Holding a high-power pose for as little as two minutes increases your testosterone levels, which are associated with confidence, and decreases your cortisol levels, which are associated with stress. Fake it till you make it!

2. *Tell yourself that you're going to have a fresh start.* January 1 is a new year, but it is an arbitrary point in the lives of most people. January 1 may be a good date to set new commitments, but it's not much better than July 28. *If you just keep in mind that you're going to have a fresh start, whatever the motivation, then you're going to have a burst of energy.* These "intertemporal markers" encourage us in two ways: by making us disconnect from past failures, and by promoting a big-picture view of life.

Believing either makes us more motivated to sequester away our failures and get things done. The idea is that we think of the past as the past, that tomorrow is a totally new day. So think of a recent event, be it a promotion, a breakup, or some other special occasion, and contrive a fresh start. You'll find it more believable than you think.

3. *Grab some chocolate--or some other dopamine-releasing reward.* People who work hard, or are "go-getters", have higher levels of dopamine, while "slackers" have lower levels of dopamine. Chocolate is as effective as certain pharmaceuticals in inducing strong dopamine responses.

Chocolate increases serotonin (promotes calm) and phenylethylamine (promotes stimulation). It triggers a release of dopamine (elevates your heart rate and increases motivation). It results in a mild antidepressant, because your brain responds to the stimulants by promoting blissful emotions.

4. *Write a contract--and donate the proceeds to charity if you lose.* Place a bet on something and bet your friend that you'll do it, else money is donated (`stickk.com`).

People tend toward hyperbolic discounting (overvaluing the short run relative to the long run). We know what's good right now isn't necessarily good for the long run. Commitment devices change this up so that choosing what feels good in the short run gets more costly.

Also, there is a concrete goal.

5. *See some green.* Sales are colored red because people react faster and more forcefully when they see the color. Green = for motivation and energy and creativity.
