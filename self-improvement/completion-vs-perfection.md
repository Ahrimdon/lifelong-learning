# Completion vs. Perfection
[Reference](https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2011/02/completion-vs-perfection/)

- Completion generates results. Perfectionism delays or kills results.
- Polishing a completed project can make it even better, as long as the polishing process doesn't incur unreasonable delays or cancel the project.
- ***I've done well as a blogger because I publish articles, not because I write them. I never feel that any article I post is perfect. But I push myself to publish what I write, even though the result is always less than perfect.***
- My website is far from perfect, but it's functional enough to deliver value to people. Better result than perfect website with the perfect content with the launch delayed indefinitely.
- Standards for completion: make sure they serve your drive for completion. When are you going to deliver something finished? How are you going to bring your project to a close and get it released?
- When you deliver your final work product into someone else's hands, it will virtually never be received with 100% appreciation and gratitude. Someone will always find fault with it.
- Accept the consequences of completion.
- People tend to be happier when they're achieving new goals and getting new projects completed. Most authors are quite radiant when they've just finished a new book.
- When you adopt a more realistic view of success, it becomes easier to complete projects.
- Have a playful attitude towards the negative aspects of success. I think it's unwise to take ourselves too seriously.
- ***Perfectionists fear the negative aspects of success.***
- I intentionally write articles that I expected would generate mostly negative feedback. I wrote them partly as an act of courage for myself, so I could get past any lingering fears regarding negative feedback.
- By playfully embracing the negative aspects of success, I actually invited more of the positive aspects into my life as well.
