## 2.1: Introduction: Religious Buddhism and "Secular" Buddhism

Western Buddhism - not that much on supernatural stuff.

Course = scientific evaluation of Buddhist ideas. We can't evaluate supernatural stuff in a science experiment anyway.

Naturalistic world view: People can in principle give people a sense of meaning, moral orientation, consolation in times of sorrow.

Can we call this religious? Depends on how you define religion.

William James: "The life of religion consists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves hitherto.

Buddhism says there is an unseen order, but only about the "truth of how things work". These truths are unseen because of how the human mind has distractions, and Buddhism can lay a path out for harmonious adjustment.

The Buddhist claim is we can relieve our suffering. Is this true? This is what the course is all about.

I think modern psych is leaning towards Buddhist ideas. They are finding out that certain deceptions/distortions are built in the human mind and we suffer as a result.

Buddhism say that "the self" does not exist.

Buddhism is sort of rebellious against natural selection. Can the rebellion be successful?

Has meditation allowed people to see things more clearly? We will hear from prominent psychologists who have heard things about it.

## 2.2: Feelings and Illusions

Buddhist nun from Taiwan, we talked about meditation and he asked if he can video her meditation.

"When you are angry or have a great emotion and you trust the feeling as real, but when you are meditating/contemplating, the anger/fear/anxiety, you realize those things are not real. They help you to see the nature of anger/fear/anxiety and you find that it's different, and you make the analysis that it's just like you're watching a movie, it's a picture by picture emotion which you think is real, but when you take it piece by piece you see it isn't really that real."

So what exactly does it mean when you say that "feelings are real"? On the one hand, it's not found in core Buddhist doctrine anywhere the assertion that "feelings aren't real".

It is part of Buddhist thought that our feelings are not reliable guides to reality/not entirely trustworthy, and meditation is a technique of giving yourself distance to distance yourself from feelings to avoid being mislead by them.

This matters because feelings can influence your perceptions and your thoughts, and you get to know this by observing your meditation and your mind. This is something that psychologists have taken attention to recently.

Ex: The pictures about thinking about what a photo represents (alligator vs squirrel, rope vs snake). When you play happy music, it doesn't have an effect, but the scary music made people think they were seeing a snake more than rope.

Why is our brain built like this? Because your brain changes its frame of mind when you are afraid. Sophocles: "To the mind that is afraid, everything rustles." From natural selection POV, it actually make sense because "it's better safe than sorry."

Natural selection designs organisms to do one thing: to get genes to the next generation. Natural selection produces organisms things that look like they were produced by a designer.

When people hear possible things are coming, they overestimate how soon they get there (better safe than sorry). The point of this is to draw one basic parallel: Buddhism says we should be skeptical of our feelings, they aren't necessarily truthful guides towards reality.

Mistakes like this may not seem very high, but sometimes the stakes are higher. Psychologists discovered that if they show people a horror movie then show them photos of different ethnic groups that they see more angry faces/expressions.

Remember that politicians manipulate people's emotions so they can change their perceptions of the people the politicians want to go to war with.

## 2.3: The First Two Noble Truths

We aren't actually sure if the Buddha's life events are true but we know that his teachings were being taught 2000 years before Jesus.

**The First Truth: The Existence of Suffering**

BTW the word "suffering" may not be the correct translation. We see "duhkha" and "dukkha".

    Sanskrit | Pali    | Meaning
    Duhkha   | Dukkha  | Suffering (?) or unsatisfactoriness in life.
    Nirvana  | Nibbana | Redemption
    Dharma   | Dhamma  | The path that the Buddha said we should tread, the truth of the way the universe is structured.

If we postulate "unsatisfactoriness" to be the meaning of duhkha, it makes a bit more sense, in that duhkha is a pervasive part of life. There are parts of your life where you don't feel suffering, but you are almost always feeling unsatisfied about things. Ex: When you eat a donut you are sort of anticipating the next donut already.

Nothing is permanent in the world, certainly suffering.

**The Second Truth: The Cause of Suffering**

In clinging to things that won't last, we cling to a delusion about the impermanence of things. These stakes go beyond donuts. We are not just talking about raw sensory pleasures, we're thinking of things that make you feel good (recognition, fame, etc.). You will want more, it's a hedonistic treadmill. When people do get happier, as a rule, their happiness returns to its normal level.

The second sense is that although it sounds like the first two noble truths are about things we desire, we also have anxiety and fears, such as anxiety about a party. In the second noble truth there isn't anything about aversion.

We can phrase things about how anxieties and fears do fit. If you fear social criticisms, that's because you're clinging to your social status, and that's a problem. If you fear a charging lion, it's because you are attached to your own existence.

The idea isn't that we should never be attracted to things we should enjoy, it is about the clinging to things.

## 2.4: Evolutionary Psychology and the First Two Noble Truths

Why is it that we fail to get the picture about pleasure and how fleeting it is?

In Buddhist writing, Buddha uses a word that is translated into "illusion". Well in donuts I'm not focused on what might happen but I'm focused on that moment of pleasure.

In some other cases some delusion might happen, when you have a crush on someone you have a distorted view and you can't find any blemishes on that person and that you think it's nice to have a relationship with that person. Or in a job where you think that "if I can get this job I have arrived." Well the gratification is fleeting.

In popular science we hear about dopamine. We monitor monkey's brains and figure out how much they see the dopamine spike. It turns out that natural selection keeps dopamine/pleasure to be fleeting. Why? (BTW when I say "design", I mean it is from a design approach, not a designer.)

So if we were designing animals, how do we design? Obviously, eating and sex keeps them alive. Social structure also keeps them alive. Social status is correlated with getting more to the next generation.

### How Brains Might Help Spread Genes

1. Deliver some pleasure after the animal reaches important goals. Pleasure encourages better behavior.
2. Pleasure should not last forever. If you ate one meal and just blissed out and never felt the unpleasant sensation of hunger again, you would die. If you had sex, and just basked in the afterglow for a long time, another animal which is doing something better is going to get more genes out there.
3. Make the animal focus more on the pleasure that is to come than on its ensuing evaporation.

They make sense of both natural selection and Buddhist teaching -- we like pleasure but it evaporates so we can do more work. The Buddha says that we focus on the pleasure and not on the fleeting nature of pleasure.

### Anticipation of Pleasure

When a monkey anticipates pleasure, dopamine spikes right up! Anticipation is not just pleasure, but there is also a kind of imagining the actual pleasure when you get the reward. That may be one thing that is being captured by the dopamine spike.

When the monkey actually receives the reward, they don't get a heightened level of dopamine. (This can be because your mind is so used to the routine of actually eating the thing that you have a normal reaction anyway.)

Why does the brain like donuts when it's bad for us? Because the brain was developed for sweetness/calories, but now we have junk food so we go crazy.

Why don't we just leave the anticipation and not do the pleasure itself? Because we actually get a dopamine DEFICIT when you withhold the pleasure. Evolutionarily we want to not repeat unhappy/unproductive experiences.

To summarize, there is a correspondence between how the brain works and how Buddhism is: pleasure, fleetingness.

Natural selection also doesn't care if we're happy. Happiness gets us to do things that natural selection wants.

In this case Buddhism is a counter to natural selection, because Buddhism wants us to see the world clearly, and natural selection sometimes wants us to not see the world correctly.
