## Keys to a Perfect Morning

- Spend 5 minutes before going to bed mapping your top 1-3 priorities for the next day.
- Spend 10 minutes before bed thinking about your #1 goal or #1 problem you're trying to solve. Edison: "Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious."
- Go to bed 7 hours before you intend to wake up.
- Don't look at any electronics screens 30-60 minutes before going to bed.
- Don't check email/social media within 60 minutes of going to bed.
- Have an alarm set across your room so you have to get out of bed to quiet the alarm.
- Spend 2-10 minutes in prayer/meditation. Focus on gratitude, your goals, and where you are needed today. This will set your day's trajectory on the things that really matter.
- Pull out your journal and write by hand anything that comes to your mind related to your #1 goal or #1 problem you're trying to solve.
- During your journal session, write your big picture/vision goals down in point form and in present tense.
- Spend 15-45 minutes in intensive physical fitness.
- Consume 30 grams of protein.
- Spend 15-60 minutes in focused activity on a big picture goal or passion project.
- Don't check email/social media for at least 60 minutes.
- Cold shower: Just start with cold. During shower, breathe heavily in and out through your mouth. *Breathe deeply yet relaxed for 30 seconds, until you can feel what Hof calls the inner fire.*
- Listen or read uplifting content.
- After you've spent a few minutes purposely preparing yourself for how you intend to be that day, lovingly interact with your loved ones. Send a few texts to important people in your life.
- Spend 60-90 minutes in focused activity on a big project.
- *If you're doing creative "Deep Work" immediately upon waking up, try listening to instrumental/ambient songs on repeat.* When you're listening to a song on repeat, you tend to dissolve into the song, which blocks out mind wandering.
