[Reference](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/how-to-handle-a-needy-employee-a9ede4bc913a)

- Ask what their former manager was like. Understand who their worst boss was.
- Give employees permission to fail.
- Instill confidence in their role. Needy employees want to impress you. "I trust you on this. I believe in you."
- Make it clear what "good enough" is. Set a standard for what is "good" work.
- Tell it straight: be straightforward to a person if you want their behavior to change.
