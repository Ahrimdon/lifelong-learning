## 15 Things You Must Give Up to Be Happy Again
[Link](http://www.marcandangel.com/2014/02/16/15-things-you-must-give-up-to-be-happy-again/#more-719)

*Choosing to do nothing.* You don’t get to choose how you are going to die, or when. You can only decide how you are going to live, right now.

*The excuses you keep reciting to yourself.* Sooner or later you will come to realize that it’s not what you lose along the way that counts; it’s what you do with what you still have.

*Avoiding the reality of the present.* You can’t change what you refuse to confront.  You can’t find peace by avoiding it.  Deal with problems before they deal with your happiness.  Don’t let a hard lesson harden your heart.  Remember, life’s best lessons are usually learned at the worst times and from the worst mistakes.

*Over-thinking and worrying about everything.* – When your fears have you looking too deep into things, it creates problems, it doesn’t fix them.

*Who you once were in the past.* –  Sometimes you have to step outside of the person you’ve been, and remember the person you were meant to be, the person you are capable of being, and the person you truly are.

*Doubting your own faith and courage.* – You can be comfortable or courageous, but you cannot be both.  By taking a leap of faith, you find out who you are truly capable of becoming.

*Thinking you don’t have what it takes.* – It’s not about how hard life can hit you; it’s about how hard you can be hit while continuing to move forward.  That’s what true strength is.  And that’s what winning the game of life is all about.

*Pessimism and negative self-talk.* – Talking about our problems is our greatest addiction.  Break this negative habit.  Talk about your joys, your loves, and your dreams instead.  What you see in life often depends entirely on what you’re looking for.

*Excessive pride.* – Get out of your own way.  Stop judging everyone and everything.  Pride is one of the greatest enemies to your happiness and growth.

*Comparing yourself to everyone else.* – Sometimes the reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes circumstances with everyone else’s public highlight reel.  Give it up.  Don’t compare your Chapter 1 to someone else’s Chapter 15.  Follow your own path, write your own life story, and never give up on yourself.  Remember this:  Happiness formula = Do YOUR best and feel good about it. | Unhappiness formula = Compare yourself to everyone else.

*Procrastinating and senselessly wasting time.* – Remember, you are the customer of a bank called Time.  Every morning it credits you with 86,400 seconds.  Every night it writes off, as a loss, whatever remainder you have failed to invest to good purpose.  It carries over no balance.  It allows no overdraft.  Each day it opens a new account for you with the same deposit of 86,400 seconds.  Each night it burns the remains of the day.  If you fail to use the day’s deposits, the loss is yours.  There is no going back.  There is no drawing against the tomorrow.  You must live in the present on today’s deposits only.  Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness, and success.  You’re making withdrawals right this second; make them count.

## 30 Things to Stop Doing to Yourself
[Link](http://www.marcandangel.com/2011/12/11/30-things-to-stop-doing-to-yourself/)

*Stop spending time with the wrong people.* Life is too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you.  If someone wants you in their life, they’ll make room for you.  You shouldn’t have to fight for a spot.  Never, ever insist yourself to someone who continuously overlooks your worth.  And remember, it’s not the people that stand by your side when you’re at your best, but the ones who stand beside you when you’re at your worst that are your true friends.

*Stop running from your problems.* Face them head on.  No, it won’t be easy.  There is no person in the world capable of flawlessly handling every punch thrown at them.  We aren’t supposed to be able to instantly solve problems.  That’s not how we’re made.  In fact, we’re made to get upset, sad, hurt, stumble and fall.  Because that’s the whole purpose of living – to face problems, learn, adapt, and solve them over the course of time.  This is what ultimately molds us into the person we become.

*Stop lying to yourself.* You can lie to anyone else in the world, but you can’t lie to yourself.  Our lives improve only when we take chances, and the first and most difficult chance we can take is to be honest with ourselves.

*Stop putting your own needs on the back burner.* The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too.  Yes, help others; but help yourself too.  If there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do something that matters to you, that moment is now.

*Stop trying to be someone you’re not.* Someone will always be prettier, someone will always be smarter, someone will always be younger, but they will never be you. Don’t change so people will like you. Be yourself and the right people will love the real you.

*Stop trying to hold onto the past.* You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading your last one.

*Stop being scared to make a mistake.* Doing something and getting it wrong is at least ten times more productive than doing nothing.  Every success has a trail of failures behind it, and every failure is leading towards success.  You end up regretting the things you did NOT do far more than the things you did.

*Stop berating yourself for old mistakes.* We may love the wrong person and cry about the wrong things, but no matter how things go wrong, one thing is for sure, mistakes help us find the person and things that are right for us.  We all make mistakes, have struggles, and even regret things in our past.  But you are not your mistakes, you are not your struggles, and you are here NOW with the power to shape your day and your future.  Every single thing that has ever happened in your life is preparing you for a moment that is yet to come.

*Stop trying to buy happiness.* Many of the things we desire are expensive.  But the truth is, the things that really satisfy us are totally free – love, laughter and working on our passions.

*Stop exclusively looking to others for happiness.* You have to create stability in your own life first before you can share it with someone else.

*Stop being idle.*

*Stop thinking you’re not ready.* Nobody ever feels 100% ready when an opportunity arises.  Because most great opportunities in life force us to grow beyond our comfort zones, which means we won’t feel totally comfortable at first.

*Stop getting involved in relationships for the wrong reasons.* It’s better to be alone than to be in bad company.  There’s no need to rush.  If something is meant to be, it will happen – in the right time, with the right person, and for the best reason. Fall in love when you’re ready, not when you’re lonely.

*Stop rejecting new relationships just because old ones didn’t work.* In life you’ll realize that there is a purpose for everyone you meet.  Some will test you, some will use you and some will teach you.  But most importantly, some will bring out the best in you.

*Stop trying to compete against everyone else.* Don’t worry about what others are doing better than you.  Concentrate on beating your own records every day.  Success is a battle between YOU and YOURSELF only.

*Stop being jealous of others.* Jealousy is the art of counting someone else’s blessings instead of your own. Ask yourself this:  “What’s something I have that everyone wants?”

*Stop complaining and feeling sorry for yourself.* Life’s curveballs are thrown for a reason – to shift your path in a direction that is meant for you.  You may not see or understand everything the moment it happens, and it may be tough.  But reflect back on those negative curveballs thrown at you in the past.  You’ll often see that eventually they led you to a better place, person, state of mind, or situation.  So smile!  Let everyone know that today you are a lot stronger than you were yesterday, and you will be.

*Stop holding grudges.* Don’t live your life with hate in your heart.  You will end up hurting yourself more than the people you hate.  Forgiveness is not saying, “What you did to me is okay.”  It is saying, “I’m not going to let what you did to me ruin my happiness forever.”  Forgiveness is the answer... let go, find peace, liberate yourself!  And remember, forgiveness is not just for other people, it’s for you too.  If you must, forgive yourself, move on and try to do better next time.

*Stop letting others bring you down to their level.* Refuse to lower your standards to accommodate those who refuse to raise theirs.

*Stop wasting time explaining yourself to others.* Your friends don’t need it and your enemies won’t believe it anyway.  Just do what you know in your heart is right.

*Stop doing the same things over and over without taking a break.* The time to take a deep breath is when you don’t have time for it.  If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting.  Sometimes you need to distance yourself to see things clearly.

*Stop overlooking the beauty of small moments.*

*Stop trying to make things perfect.* – The real world doesn’t reward perfectionists, it rewards people who get things done.  Read Getting Things Done.

*Stop following the path of least resistance.*

*Stop acting like everything is fine if it isn’t.* It’s okay to fall apart for a little while.  You don’t always have to pretend to be strong, and there is no need to constantly prove that everything is going well.  You shouldn’t be concerned with what other people are thinking either – cry if you need to – it’s healthy to shed your tears.  The sooner you do, the sooner you will be able to smile again.

*Stop blaming others for your troubles.* The extent to which you can achieve your dreams depends on the extent to which you take responsibility for your life.  When you blame others for what you’re going through, you deny responsibility – you give others power over that part of your life.

*Stop trying to be everything to everyone.* Doing so is impossible, and trying will only burn you out.  But making one person smile CAN change the world.  Maybe not the whole world, but their world.  So narrow your focus.

*Stop worrying so much.* Worry will not strip tomorrow of its burdens, it will strip today of its joy.  One way to check if something is worth mulling over is to ask yourself this question: “Will this matter in one year’s time?  Three years?  Five years?”  If not, then it’s not worth worrying about.

*Stop focusing on what you don’t want to happen.* Focus on what you do want to happen.  Positive thinking is at the forefront of every great success story.  If you awake every morning with the thought that something wonderful will happen in your life today, and you pay close attention, you’ll often find that you’re right.

*Stop being ungrateful.* No matter how good or bad you have it, wake up each day thankful for your life.  Someone somewhere else is desperately fighting for theirs.  Instead of thinking about what you’re missing, try thinking about what you have that everyone else is missing.

## [10 Choices You Will Regret in 10 Years](http://www.marcandangel.com/2013/01/18/10-choices-you-will-regret-in-10-years/)

*Wearing a mask to impress others.* If the face you always show the world is a mask, someday there will be nothing beneath it.  Because when you spend too much time concentrating on everyone else’s perception of you, or who everyone else wants you to be, you eventually forget who you really are.  So don’t fear the judgments of others; you know in your heart who you are and what’s true to you.  You don’t have to be perfect to impress and inspire people.  Let them be impressed and inspired by how you deal with your imperfections.

*Letting someone else create your dreams for you.* The greatest challenge in life is discovering who you are; the second greatest is being happy with what you find.  A big part of this is your decision to stay true to your own goals and dreams.  Do you have people who disagree with you?  Good.  It means you’re standing your ground and walking your own path.  Sometimes you’ll do things considered crazy by others, but when you catch yourself excitedly losing track of time, that’s when you’ll know you’re doing the right thing.

*Keeping negative company.* Don’t let someone who has a bad attitude give it to you.  Don’t let them get to you.  They can’t pull the trigger if you don’t hand them the gun.  When you remember that keeping the company of negative people is a choice, instead of an obligation, you free yourself to keep the company of compassion instead of anger, generosity instead of greed, and patience instead of anxiety.

*Being selfish and egotistical.* A life filled with loving deeds and good character is the best tombstone.  Those who you inspired and shared your love with will remember how you made them feel long after your time has expired.  So carve your name on hearts, not stone.  What you have done for yourself alone dies with you; what you have done for others and the world remains.

*Avoiding change and growth.* You must let go of the old to make way for the new; the old way is gone, never to come back.  If you acknowledge this right now and take steps to address it, you will position yourself for lasting success.

*Giving up when the going gets tough.* There are no failures, just results.  Even if things don’t unfold the way you had expected, don’t be disheartened or give up.  Learn what you can and move on.  The one who continues to advance one step at a time will win in the end.  Because the battle is always won far away and long before the final victory.  It’s a process that occurs with small steps, decisions, and actions that gradually build upon each other and eventually lead to that glorious moment of triumph.

*Trying to micromanage every little thing.* Life should be touched, not strangled.  Sometimes you’ve got to relax and let life happen without incessant worry and micromanagement.  Learn to let go a little before you squeeze too tight.  Take a deep breath.  When the dust settles and you can once again see the forest for the trees, take the next step forward.  You don’t have to know exactly where you’re going to be headed somewhere great.  Everything in life is in perfect order whether you understand it yet or not.  It just takes some time to connect all the dots.

*Settling for less than you deserve.* Be strong enough to let go and wise enough to wait for what you deserve.  Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been to stand up taller than you ever were before.  Sometimes your eyes need to be washed by your tears so you can see the possibilities in front of you with a clearer vision again.  Don’t settle.

*Endlessly waiting until tomorrow.* The trouble is, you always think you have more time than you do.  But one day you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to work on the things you’ve always wanted to do.  And at that point you either will have achieved the goals you set for yourself, or you will have a list of excuses for why you haven’t.  Read The Last Lecture.

*Being lazy and wishy-washy.* The world doesn’t owe you anything, you owe the world something.  So stop daydreaming and start DOING.  Develop a backbone, not a wishbone.  Take full responsibility for your life – take control.  You are important and you are needed.  It’s too late to sit around and wait for somebody to do something someday.  Someday is now; the somebody the world needs is YOU.

# 16 Things Emotionally Strong People Don't Do
[link](http://www.marcandangel.com/2014/06/15/16-things-emotionally-strong-people-dont-do/#more-755)

1. *They don't let negativity and drama get the best of them.* Emotionally strong people tune out negativity to make room for positivity. Walk away from the nonsense around you. Focus on the positives, and soon the negatives will be harder to see.
2. *They don't waste time feeling sorry for themselves.* Emotionally strong people don't sit around feeling sorry about their circumstances or how others have treated them. Instead, they take responsibility for their role in life, work on changing what can be changed, and keep in mind that life isn't always easy or fair. *In the end, happiness is not the absence of problems, but simply the ability to deal well with them. So look at what you have, instead of what you have lost.*
3. *They don't think they need more to be happy.* Emotionally strong people know that happiness is a mindset of appreciation. In other words, happiness doesn't start when "this, that, or the other thing" is resolved. Happiness is what happens now when you appreciate what you have.
4. *They don't compare their journey to everyone else's.* Social comparison is the thief of happiness. Do your best and don't compare your progress with that of others. They aren't you.
5. *They don't envy and resent other people's success.* Emotionally strong people can genuinely appreciate and celebrate other people's success. They don't grow envious or feel cheated when others achieve something they are trying to achieve. Instead, they recognize that success comes with hard work, and they are willing to work hard for their own chance at success.
6. *They don't expecte everything to be easy.* They don't view failures and delays as reasons to give up. Instead, they use failure as an opportunity to grow and improve. They are willing to keep trying until they get it right.
7. *They don't say, "I can't."* If you really want to do something, you can and you will find a way. If you don't, you will surely find a long list of excuses. So stop saying "I wish" and start saying "I will."
8. *They don't let fleeting distractions distract them from their dreams. Don't let the temptations of today distract you from what you deserve.* Don't let the temptations of today distract you from what you deserve. Stay emotionally strong. Do what you have to do now so you can do what you want to do later.
9. *They don't get impatient and settle.* Good things come to those who are patient, while working hard for what they want most in life. If you know what you want, if you can see it, feel it, and move toward it in some small way every single day, it has to happen.
10. *They don't make the exact same mistakes over and over again.* The second time you make a mistake, it's a choice. Emotionally strong people accept responsibility for their behavior and learn from their past mistakes. As a result, they don't keep repeating the same mistakes over and over. Instead, they grow and move on to better decisions and new lessons.
11. *They don't resist change.* Emotionally strong people welcome positive change into their life and are willing to be flexible. They understand that change is inevitable and believe in their abilities to adapt. Change happens for a reason. Roll with it!
12. *They don't waste time and energy on things they can't control.* Emotionally strong people don't complain over traffic jams and rainy days. *Instead, they focus on what they can control in their lives. They recognize that sometimes the only thing they can control is their attitude. Inner peace begins the moment you choose not to allow an uncontrollable event or person to control your emotions.*
13. *They don't hang on every word other people say about them.* Emotionally strong people listen to their own heart and intuition, not the peanut gallery. So try not to take things other people say about you too personally. What they think and say is a reflection of them, not you. *Ultimately, you can't change how people treat you or what they say about you. All you can do is change how you react and who you choose to be around.*
14. *They don't think everyone is out to get them.* Emotionally strong people choose to see the good in others. *The truth is, the world is full of good people. Whoever says otherwise hasn't looked around.*
15. *They don't worry about pleasing everyone.* Emotionally strong people recognize they don't need to please everyone all the time. They're not afraid to say no or speak up when necessary. They strive to be compassionate and fair, but can handle other people being disappointed if they didn't live up to their unfair expectations. The bottom line thing is, pleasing everyone is impossible. May the bridges you burn light your way.
16. *They don't think it's too late to start over. Let go of the idea that it's too late to start over. Remember, it's always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than at the top you don't, even if it means beginning anew. Just because some things didn't work out as you had expected, or didnt' happen as fast as you thought they would is no excuse to give up on yourself. Time passes one way or the other. Do what you need to do, at the very least, you can look back someday and say, "I gave life my best shot."*

# 16 Things You Shouldn't Have to Justify to Anyone Else
[link](http://www.marcandangel.com/2014/06/29/16-things-you-shouldnt-have-to-justify-to-anyone-else/)

*Life is not about justifying yourself; it's creating yourself. Your life is yours alone. Others can try to persuade you, but they can't decide for you. They can walk with you, but not in your shoes.*

Make this your lifelong motto: "I respectfully do not care." Say it to anyone who passes judgment on something you strongly believe in or something that makes you who you are.

1. *Why you're putting yourself first.* There are only a few people in this world who will stay 100% true to you, and you should be one of them. Prioritize your own needs into your daily to-dos.
2. *The need to express your emotions.* There's no reason to be ashamed for feeling something or acting out on it if it's real to you.
3. *Your weirdness.* If you're lucky enough to have something that makes you different from everybody else, don't be ashamed and don't hide it.
4. *Being unapologetically you.* We are never more alive than when we are being brave, and we can't be brave unless we are willing to take off our masks and be ourselves. It's about finding the courage to be real. *When perfectionism of any kind is driving us, shame is always riding shotgun and fear is the backseat diver. Don't do this to yourself.*
5. *Not taking things personally.* Defend yourself from others by not taking the things they say and do personally. If you take everything personally, you will remain offended for the rest of your life.
6. *Deciding to forgive.* Grudges are for those who insist that they are owed something. Forgiveness is for those who are confident enough to stand on their own two legs and move forward. In order to move forward, you must know why you felt the way you did, and why you no longer need to feel that way.
7. *Who you choose to spend your time with.* It's more likely that what you will wish you could spend time with your loved ones as opposed to wishing your worked harder.
8. *Not perfectly measuring up to everyone's else's progress.* Everyone needs their own time to travel their own distance. Great things in life don't happen when society tells you they're supposed to happen--they happen when they're meant to be.
9. *Why you have failed, and why you aren't scared to fail again.* Failure is the opportunity to begin again, smarter than before.
10. *The young-minded, foolish things you did.* I don't entirely approve of some of the things I've done in my life, but I am me, and I wouldn't be me if I hadn't learned along the way. *All wise old people were once young and foolish; that's how they became wise. Don't be ashamed of who you had to be to get to where you are today.*
11. *Dressing down and not looking all fixed up every second.* You don't have to apologize to someone else for not looking a certain way; you have to apologize to yourself for feeling like you had to in the first place.
12. *Your healthy eating habits.* Why do we need to stand up for ourselves when we choose to eat healthy?  Because for some reason, people tend to be skeptical that a person would actually just want to treat their body right and not be perpetually concerned with their shape and size.  Eat healthy because it's good for your health.
13. *Working extra hard on your dreams.* A lot of people dream, and that is all they do. And while they are busy dreaming, the really happy people are busy doing something with their dreams.
14. *Choosing to smile through the struggles.* Not every day will be good, but there will be something good about every day. Life doesn't get easier or more forgiving; you just get stronger and more resilient. Your positivity will help you realize that sometimes the bad things that happen in your life put you on a direct path to the best possible things that could ever happen to you.
15. *The things you hope for.* Hope isn't the belief that life will always give you what you want; it's the belief that life will gradually reveal what's right.
16. *Why you feel completely justified already.* You don't need a standing ovation or a bestseller or a promotion or a million bucks.  You are enough right now.  You have nothing to justify.  Care less about who you are to others and more about who you are to yourself.  You will have less heartaches and disappointments the minute you stop seeking from others the justification only YOU can give yourself.
