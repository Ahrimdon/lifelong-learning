- At Crew, we don't work set hours. Because we have different energy levels at different times, it would be counterproductive for them to start work at 9AM.
- Our work schedules are guided by our energy levels.
- History of the 40 hour work week: 1920s Henry Ford, he knew that if people are to buy his cars, they should have time to drive them.

- Genetics: Causes your cycle to be longer or shorter.
- If you prefer working nights, then you are stuck working at a time when your energy levels are low.
- Things that can work
  - Write a realistic to-do list for the 3-4 major tasks that you want to get done. Plan for 4-5 hours of real work per day.
  - Create cycles with your work: a creative task, an untimed break, a mundane task, an untimed break, repeat.
  - One night a week, my wife and I have a planned time where we spend time not talking about any work.
  - True metric to measure your task: what is the goal of your writing/coding/whatever? If your goal is to get your thoughts down, then maybe you should be measuring how many days in a row you are writing.
