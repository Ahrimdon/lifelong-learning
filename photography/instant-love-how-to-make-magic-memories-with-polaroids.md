## The Art of Composition

- Rule of thirds.
  - Horizon on either the upper or lower horizontal line.
  - Primary subject on the right third of the grid.
  - Center of the frame, ensuring their eyes line up with the upper horizontal line of the grid.
- Rule of odds.
  - Threes rather than twos, fives, rather than fours.
- Depth of field.
  - Landscapes: large DOF that takes in everything from the camera.
- Perspective:
  - Standing on a chair and looking down on a sleeping cat creates a sense of the distance between the viewer and the cat.
  - Lying on the floor next to that cat creates immediate intimacy and a "cat's eye view".
  - Close up = captures attention. Behind: they are looking into another's private world.
- Framing:
  - Consider including frames within your frame, lines and shapes that frame your subject and draw the eye deeper int othe photo.
- Portrait basics:
  - Model is seated, face slightly tilted, and looking up into the camera lens. Pick a spot where the sun is behind you, with a bit of cloud cover to soften the light and prevent harsh shadows on their face.
