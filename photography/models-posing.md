- Pose the hair. Hair sitting on shoulders looks terrible. You can put it in front on one or both sides, or ponytail it.
- Pull the chin/ears forward.
- Lift the arm, if they are not lifting the arm it looks weird.
- Leave visual space by the waist.
- Turn the shoulders, if they stare at the camera head-on, they look bigger.
- Show they iris of the eye, not the whites.
