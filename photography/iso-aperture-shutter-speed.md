## Photography Tutorial: ISO, Aperture, Shutter Speed
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_B8pVoANyY)

- ISO: A camera's sensitivity to light. Set this one first, then set shutter and aperture. High ISO: noisy, grainy. What you want to keep your ISO as low as possible, so richer colors and low noise.
- Aperture: The measurement of how open or close your iris is. Depth of field (an inch to infinity). Phone = high depth of field, you see everything in the background. Background = no focus. Higher F-Stop: "There happens to be someone there." Lower F-Stop, blurrier background.
- Shutter: Fast if it's sunny outside. 1/2000 or 1/4000 will stop a hummingbird, snake strike, race car. Longer exposure: if the shutter is open for a long time and the motion happening is just turning into a blur. Moving your hands around can also contribute to blur. Sometimes your shutter is too low because it is trying to compensate for the lack of light.
- F-Stop numbers: the distance of the opening to the diameter of the lens. Lower number = shallower depth of field.
- This will correctly expose a picture based on the criteria. If you set the shutter for really fast, the camera will calculate the thing.

- High aperture: more focus on the background.
- High shutter speed (1/2): blurry.
- High ISO: Grainier.

## Composition MISTAKES Every Photographer SHOULD AVOID!

- 2 subjects.
- Person looking outside the frame. If they look outside the frame, then you split the subject along the middle. At least you see the person look into the scene and you remove eyeball confusion.
- Lines that cut/divide the subject. Not forest, but bridges.
- Lazy composition. Difference between shooting a pet photo from the top as opposed to shooting from the bottom/from ground level.

- Babies, old people, interesting people, distinguishing activities (biking, smoking), people who are alone.
- Getting caught: You cannot shoot someone who is inside their home.
- Busy area with lots of foot traffic.
- Some place cool: where is a spot with cool features. Always be in scouting mode for photography. 1/25th shutter speed? 1/500 if on a bike, deeper depth of field.
- Shooting in lower-light conditions: lower aperture number for more light?
- Raw mode, white balance set to auto. You can fix this in Lightroom.

- Portraits: 1/60, 2.8, ISO 500.
- Exposure is different from focus.
