## Stunning Digital Photography

### Chapter 1: Quick Tips

- Take lots of pictures and delete most of them, better to get everything, keep on flipping through the pictures and delete all but the best shot.
- Viewpoints: for smaller subjects, meet them eye-to-eye. Flowers: lie on the ground and shoot up to get the sun. Stand on chairs, etc.
- Ditch the lens cap and camera bag? It's too time consuming. Lens hood, not lens cap.
- Learn camera: flash, continuous shooting, timer, aperture/shutter priority, histogram.
- Fill flash/bounce flash to remove shadows.
- Use your pictures: print, post, digital picture frame.
- Great thumbnail: If the thumbnail doesn't grab people's attention, they won't click on it to see the full-size portrait.
- Make a picture, don't take a picture. Figure out the photo, location, viewpoint, time, natural light, exposure/perspective/background/depth-of-field.
- Don't worry about the equipment.
  - Going at the right time, picking a decent day, if there was no wind, composing, take a lot of photos, pick the best one, and edit to level the horizon.
- Extra batteries and memory cards.

### Chapter 2: Composition

- Rule of thirds.
- Rule of space: if the subject if moving, leave room in front of where the subject is moving towards. Landscapes: if you can, have a focal point.
- Telephoto lens usually makes the background blurry.
- Showing scale: if the subject's size is important, you need to include something of a known size in the frame. This is why new babies include the dad's hand.
- Lines:
  - Converging parallel: vanishing point.
  - Horizontal: sense of quiet and peace.
  - Vertical lines: powerful, solid, and permanent.
  - Diagonal: dynamic, conveys movement and change.
  - Straight lines: formal, deliberate, man-made.
  - Curved lines: casual and sophisticated.
- Patterns leading of the frame show quantity.
- Symmetry: Geometric precision and beauty.
- Square composition: stately, formal, and professional attitude.
- Balancing/visual weight.

### Chapter 3: Lighting & Flash

- Hard light: direct sunlight/bare bulb. Soft light: reflected and diffused light.
- Photographers cherish soft lighting because cameras capture mid-tones the best. Better than purely highlights and shadows.
- Hard lighting accentuates texture because every pore has its own highlight and shadow. Unflattering for a person.
- Low contrast lighting for portraits so that pores and dimples are hidden by the lighting.

### Chapter 4: Controlling your Camera

- Single focus (AF-S, S-AF, one-shot, single): for still subjects.
- Continuous focus (AF-C, C-AF, AI Servo, Monitor, Tracking). Best for moving subjects.
- Focus/recompose: focus on the subject, recompose, so your focus is still on the subject.
- Fast lens: low minimum f/stop number. Moving targets: just assume that you will get a lot of out of focus shots, but hope that you have some in focus.
- How autofocus works: It looks for a strong contrast. If you want to focus on a solid color, the autofocus system won't be able to find any contrast, regardless of the amount of light you have. The easiest thing to do is to focus on an area of high contrast and then recompose.
- Shutter modes:
  - Single shot.
  - Continuous: camera takes pictures as fast as it can until you release the shutter.
  - Delayed/timed. When doing self-portraits, or to eliminate camera shake.
  - Continuous shooting? Just to make sure you aren't too shaky.
- Camera modes:
  - Program (auto?)
  - Aperture priority.
  - Shutter priority.
- Aperture: lower value, more light it lets in. Smaller number = wider aperture.
- Blurred background: lowest f/stop, zoom in all the way, choose a location with a distant background, move to the subject as close as possible.
- RAW: Your computer does a better job of converting raw files to JPEG files than your camera.

### Chapter 5: Problem Solving

- Ideal aperture: Sharpest at around f/5.6 if max aperture is 2.8.
- Air quality: causes soft images. Air always blends and blocks light.
- Low light: Tripod, raw, take many pictures, high ISO, noise reduction.
- Bad color: Manually set the white balance, turn off artificial lights, turn on flash.
- Flash sync.

### Chapter 6: Portraits.

- Traditional portraits: Main light, fill light, hair light, light on the background.
- Lens: 85-200mm, or 50mm for beginners.
- Telephoto lens for portraits to make people look flattering.
- Sun at your back and get below your subject to use the sky as a backdrop.
- You can also put a fill flash or have someone hold a reflector.
- Clouds = nature's diffuser.
- Shade provides nicer light than direct sun.
