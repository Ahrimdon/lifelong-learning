## Stunning Digital Photography

### Chapter 1: Quick Tips

- Take lots of pictures and delete most of them, better to get everything, keep on flipping through the pictures and delete all but the best shot.
- Viewpoints: for smaller subjects, meet them eye-to-eye. Flowers: lie on the ground and shoot up to get the sun. Stand on chairs, etc.
- Ditch the lens cap and camera bag? It's too time consuming. Lens hood, not lens cap.
- Learn camera: flash, continuous shooting, timer, aperture/shutter priority, histogram.
- Fill flash/bounce flash to remove shadows.
- Use your pictures: print, post, digital picture frame.
- Great thumbnail: If the thumbnail doesn't grab people's attention, they won't click on it to see the full-size portrait.
- Make a picture, don't take a picture. Figure out the photo, location, viewpoint, time, natural light, exposure/perspective/background/depth-of-field.
- Don't worry about the equipment.
  - Going at the right time, picking a decent day, if there was no wind, composing, take a lot of photos, pick the best one, and edit to level the horizon.
- Extra batteries and memory cards.

### Chapter 2: Composition

- Rule of thirds.
- Rule of space: if the subject if moving, leave room in front of where the subject is moving towards. Landscapes: if you can, have a focal point.
- Telephoto lens usually makes the background blurry.
- Showing scale: if the subject's size is important, you need to include something of a known size in the frame. This is why new babies include the dad's hand.
- Lines:
  - Converging parallel: vanishing point.
  - Horizontal: sense of quiet and peace.
  - Vertical lines: powerful, solid, and permanent.
  - Diagonal: dynamic, conveys movement and change.
  - Straight lines: formal, deliberate, man-made.
  - Curved lines: casual and sophisticated.
- Patterns leading of the frame show quantity.
- Symmetry: Geometric precision and beauty.
- Square composition: stately, formal, and professional attitude.
- Balancing/visual weight.

### Chapter 3: Lighting & Flash

- Hard light: direct sunlight/bare bulb. Soft light: reflected and diffused light.
- Photographers cherish soft lighting because cameras capture mid-tones the best. Better than purely highlights and shadows.
- Hard lighting accentuates texture because every pore has its own highlight and shadow. Unflattering for a person.
- Low contrast lighting for portraits so that pores and dimples are hidden by the lighting.
