## Mirrorless Cameras vs Dslrs: The Pros & Cons
[Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FELghBh_TQ)

- DSLR: Digital Single Reflex Lens: you can change the lenses. On the inside, there is a mirror system and there is a shutter. The mirror shows you what the light enters.
- Mirrorless: no mirror system. The sensor is constantly gathering light and that gets displayed on an LCD screen. They are digital viewfinders and they display the thing. No physical shutter. Since no mirrors, you just look at the digital image/screen (sometimes you have a viewfinder). You look at the screen, not at the viewfinder.
- Mirrorless pros: smaller, unobtrusive. Good for portraits and street photography. Less moving parts so no mirror. Also faster frame rate since no mirror that lifts up.
- Mirrorless cons: Limited lenses. No level of lenses than you do with DSLR. This is why this is the professional's choice. Weaker battery since smaller.

## Best First Lens for a DSLR or Mirrorless Camera

- Kit lens: 18-55, 18-105, 18-140. Okay for outside but for inside, you have trouble capturing portraits and subjects in low light. It is like sunglasses where it can't get images in low light.
- Prime lens: basically a lens that has 1 focal length--1 zoom setting/field of view. You cannot zoom in or out to get the type of shot you are after.
  - 50mm F 1.8. Slim profile, makes it easier to carry and shoot.
  - Disadvantage of kit lens: making the background nice and blurry. Had to increase the ISO/sensitivity of the camera to get the right amount of brightness so my son was well-lit.
  - Prime lens: adds bokeh to the image. When you zoom in, less image noise. So they are much more brighter and it not only allows you to blur the background, but you can lower the light.

## Understanding Camera Lenses

- Zoom lens: a lens that zooms in and out. Prime lens: no.
- Wide angle, mid-range, telephoto.
- Focal length: the magnification of image, representing mm.
- Human eyes see at 50mm lens. This 50mm is the normal focal length of 1 eye of a person. Anything at 28-70mm lens is considered mid-range.
- Below 28: wide angle lenses. The lower your focal length becomes, more of the scene. 15mm -- relatively normal looking wide-angle image. Due to the rounded glass in wide angle, if you go down, it becomes a fish-eye.
- Telephoto: 70mm to 1700mm. The big boy lens. Higher focal length, higher magnification. It doesn't just magnify the image, it alters the perspective of the image.
- Background compression: the subject stays the same but it changes the background. Subject can remain the same but as the focal length increases, then the background becomes more compressed.
- The mm (28-80) is a 28 to 80mm zoom lens. Then, the aperture (the ratio of 1 to whatever the minimum which is if 28-80 mm 1:3.5-5.6, then F 3.5 when at 28 mm and F 5.6 at 80 mm. Higher quality lenses: same aperture regardless of the range.
- Smaller aperture, more light comes in/best at low light performance?
- Filter size: The theta then number after.
- Do not put low quality filters in front on a high quality lens.
- Macro: if able to do close up photography or not.
- IF/internal focus: they use ultrasonic motors for focusing which allows high-speed focusing.
- Entry level DSLRs may require internal focus lenses.
- Focus ring: closest to the end of the lens.
- When putting a Lens inside the camera, it should be easy.
- Cleaning a lens: wipe it off with a lens cloth, not your shirt. You don't want to clean it too much and you might rub the thing if you clean it too easily.
- Image stabilization: an internal device which counteracts your hand movements.
- Locking the focus: no change in autofocus.

- Prime lens: one specific focal length. They are usually smaller and they can give you high depth of field and bokeh.
- Wide apertures for great low light performance.


- Lower length,
- Crop: what you
- Full frame, APS-C, Micro Four Thirds.
- A 50mm lens did not change its focal
- Higher focal length: tighter.
