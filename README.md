lifelong-learning
=================

All my notes from moocs, readings, internet articles,  ted talks. Trying to do 1 everyday.

Disclaimer: I just write them down. So expect a lot of typos/bad grammar. Also if you feel that I misattributed/copyright breached.. I will remove what I wrote on your stuff.

Favorite folder: `programming/philosophy`. The `psychology/nir-eyal` stuff as well.
