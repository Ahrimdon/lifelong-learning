`Gleam.io` caught our judges attention with the headline result “Split Testing This Phrase Increased Our Signups By 484%.”

The “powered by” growth hack is a potent one that can drive meaningful traffic and growth for companies that employ it. The powered by hack works by putting a link from the embedded content or widget back to your site. Gleam uses this same mechanic on their sweepstakes widgets. They include a “powered by” link on every sweepstakes that gets deployed on a site. Their standard language for the link was simple “Powered by Gleam”.

According to Stuart, one of the co-founders, the “Powered by Gleam” link is responsible for 30% of all new Gleam signups and is seen by roughly 1.3 million people each month. One of the core principles that gets discussed on GrowthHackers.com regularly is the notion of “doubling down” on what is working instead of trying to create new growth channels.

"Doubling down on a single channel/strategy is about increasing the probability of success component of this equation. Just like in Blackjack you optimize your winnings by doubling down on something that already has signs that it is working rather than spreading them across new channels and efforts that you don't have data on."

"Just as it's a mistake to think that you’ll have multiple equal revenue streams, you probably won't have a bunch of equally good distribution strategies. Engineers frequently fall victim to this because they do not understand distribution. Since they don't know what works, and haven't thought about it, they try some sales, BD, advertising, and viral marketing—everything but the kitchen sink.

"That is a really bad idea. It is very likely that one channel is optimal. Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. Poor distribution—not product—is the number one cause of failure. If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several but don't nail one, you’re finished. So it's worth thinking really hard about finding the single best distribution channel." -- Peter Thiel

Their baseline rate for clicks to views was 0.006%, meaning that for every 1 million views of the widget the Gleam team got 6,000 views to their site. In this blog post outlining the test, Gleam states that 3.88% of visitors signed up for the product after coming from the widget to the site. With those baseline metrics in hand, Stuart and his team could begin the process of optimization.

Perhaps inspired by Upworthy's 25 headline testing strategy, Gleam came up with twelve language variants to test on the powered by link, ranging from “Run a Free Contest Like This” to “Not Using Gleam Yet?” You can see all the variants in their blog post detailing the test. After letting the test run for 60 days they looked at the data. Their two main success criteria were clickthrough from the link and then conversions to actual sign up from the traffic.

*After running the tests for 60 days, there was a clear winner among the variants. “Not Using Gleam Yet” was converting at nearly five times the other variations, including the control “Powered by Gleam” link.*

According to Stuart the team recently made the change back to “Powered By Gleam” over the new variant. Why? *Stuart reports that while the new language helped drive conversions to sign up, the actual quality of the sign up dropped due to people who were curious, rather than qualified users.* This unintended consequence of diminished lead quality is one that many teams who are optimizing flows suffer. Getting more people through the funnel is not the same as getting the right people through the funnel.
