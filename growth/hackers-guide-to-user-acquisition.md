## The Hacker’s Guide to Twitter User Acquisition

#### Why Twitter?

- Twitter lets you see what people are interested and talking about right now.
- Twitter lets you search user profiles to find what tribes people align themselves to.
- Twitter lets you see lists of people who follow your competitors
- Twitter lets you interact with all of those people.

#### Tipzorz
- __Auto-favoriting and retweeting (the crappy way).__ This really works.
- __Selective following (the mediocre way).__ Twitter lets accounts with less than 2,000 followers follow up to 2,000 people. Those with over 2,000 can follow 1,000 people per day (so long as the number of people you follow isn’t more than 110% of the number of your followers). In other words, you can, by brute force, get a split second of attention from up to 1,000 Twitter accounts daily. It’s not pretty, but it works
- __Manual Following.__ This sucks but you have to do it at the start. If you're looking to make iPhone screen protectors, follow the followers of @zaggdaily because their followers probably like iPhone screen protectors. Better: Search for "need screen protector".

    These people are thinking of buying screen protectors RIGHT NOW.

    We can, in the course of 5 minutes: Follow people, watch them flow through to our landing page (the link on our Twitter profile), and track signups. If we don’t get 50 signups a day from Twitter alone, something is wrong.

- __Semi-manual following.__ TweetAdder. So if I’m looking for press, I can search ‘+technology +journalist,’  or ‘+tech +journalist’ and follow from my personal Twitter profile (that has a bio to emphasize the fact that I lived in a car to get a startup off the ground).  Spoiler alert: this, as well as some other press-hacking, got us in a half dozen major publications, and, in my opinion, deservedly so.
- __Interaction (Do this!)__ Use TweetAdder, TweetDeck. The conversion: Twitter Cards. Twitter Cards are an easy way to allow a Twitter user to perform an action without actually leaving the Twitter interface. With one click they can even create accounts on your system with one click. Or they can join an email list.
  
  Earlier I recommended tweeting “#SEO #social #socialmediamarketing #SEM #socialmedia SEO social media marketing.” I could hypothetically respond to everyone that tweets that particular tweet and give them a Twitter card to sign up for future chapters of The Hacker’s Guide to User Aquisition. Or I could just follow them, favorite the tweet, and have a cool new way to know who is actually reading what I write. I’m not doing anything with it yet, but you should.

## The Hacker’s Guide to Getting Press

Press brings in traffic, users/customers, social validation, legitimacy.

Getting press seems reasonably simple, but you have to scale it. __Even the crappiest companies should get a half dozen or so mentions in the press when doing so.__

#### Overall Strategy and Approach

__Customer Profiling:__ We are selling to the reporter, and what we're selling is that we're legitimate and interesting enough that their audience will want to hear about us.

Reporters have social proof too. So what we want is to start with personal tech blogs, "trying to make it" blogs. Then mid-tier, then industry-specific, then the big boys.

__List Building:__ Blogs that are “vaguely related” and reporters who write about things “kind of like” your company will not write about you. If I make iPad cases, a blog that writes about iPad apps isn’t even worth approaching. 

Use the [Scraper Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scraper/mbigbapnjcgaffohmbkdlecaccepngjd?hl=en), go to the blog ranking website (Alltop), export to Google Docs. Then go to BlogRank.

Basically scrape the top blog URLs in the categories and industries that would be most likely to cover you.

#### Create Your Angle

News isn’t worthy of publishing just because it exists. Part of the job of any journalist or reporter is curation — deciding what is worthy of being published in their publication, whether that be a blog or the New York Times. __Your job as someone looking for press is to show them how you meet their standards and/or would be interesting to their audience.__

Is it timely? Is it relevant? Is it interesting? Why would someone like you be interested in reading this?

Again, we’ll take my startup, Grasswire, for example. Grasswire is an Internet newsroom that lets everyone fact-check and sort social media content in real-time.

But what grasswire is is democratization of journalism and information. It’s turning over the power of governments and corporations to everyday people. It’s letting ordinary people control the information that determines how they see the world.

__Not many people want to read about yet another social media tool. People love to read about freedom.__

__So in the initial pitch we won’t go deep into detail about how the technology works, what APIs we pull from, why the UI/UX look like they do, etc. We talk about the story of grasswire. What we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and why it needs to be done. Reporters don’t like products very often, but they always love missions.__

Grasswire also had the benefit of the angle that I lived in my car for three months to get it off the ground; that’s interesting to anyone, if only to understand how I lived in a car, where I slept, where I showered, etc. That also goes in the arsenal, and should be mentioned when we’re sending our email, and kept in mind as we develop our press kit, which it is now time to do.

#### The Press Kit

I usually start working with a list of 1,000 or so URLs. We’ll create a semi-automated way of sending the emails in a minute, what we have to do now is create something to send them.

The Press Kit, basically a .zip file of all of the content for the reporter to use, will vary from startup to startup.

A press kit should include the following:

- Company Overview
- Founder Photos
- Logo(s)
- Press Mentions
- Product Screenshots (or photographs)

The Grasswire press kit included another document we called the “Grasswire Story,” because the idea that I lived in my car for a few months to get it off the ground was quite compelling. If you can think of anything else specific to your company that would make for an interesting story, include it in a separate document.

#### Company Overview

The company overview is a very simple document that explains who you are and what you do. Think of it as an elevator pitch for newspapers.

For Grasswire we included a tagline, a one-sentence description, three “how it works” paragraphs, and a bit of a call to action. An example might look something like this (note: this is a press kit for a real company we did work for, and it got them more than a little bit of press, from AllThingsD to the Wall Street Journal.

> Underwater Audio Overview

> Tagline: Waterproof iPods and headphones for swimmers

> Description: Underwater Audio has developed technology that allows us to waterproof ipods, headphones, and other electronic devices for swimmers.

> How it works: Underwater Audio music players come waterproofed from the inside out. They look, feel, and smell like any other 2GB iPod Shuffle — but they work underwater.

> Underwater Audio seals the iPod from the inside out using a proprietary process, and we have tested it at a depth of 200 feet (though we don’t recommend Underwater Audio for diving). Dunk it in water, leave it there, it still works.

> The Underwater Audio player will work with any headphones, though under the water you’ll need waterproof headphones to create a watertight seal with your ear to have good audio. Our recommended picks are available along with your iPod on UnderwaterAudio.com

> Underwater Audio iPods and bundles are available at UnderwaterAudio.com starting at $149.

- __Founder Photos:__ Interesting shots.
- __Logos__
- __Press Mentions__
- __Product Screenshots__

#### The Email

Ask 10 reporters what they would like to see in press pitches, and all 10 of them will say “keep it short.” And when they say short, they mean it – looking through our press pitches, anything that was longer than two (really short) paragraphs cut our response rates in half.

- Introduction
- One-sentence pitch
- Offer/ask (sample or press kit)

> Hey [name],

> My name is Austen from Underwater Audio. We developed a technology that makes iPods completely waterproof — it’s some pretty cool technology you (and your readers might be interested in. We’re at underwateraudio.com, and I have a [press kit/sample] I’d like to send your way to [review/check out] if you’d be interested. Let me know!

> Thanks, Austen Allred [contact info]

The most important part of that email, to wax Steve Jobs-like, is what isn’t there. No long introductions, no links, no videos, no demos, just “We’re here, are you interested?” I’ve also gone back and forth with varying levels of personalization, a la “I read your article about x and I really liked y” or “I’m a huge fan of your work” enough to make it clear that an email is really personalized, but the difference in results has been negligible, especially because you don’t know the writer or his publication.

It’s really easy for a reporter to hit reply and say “Yeah, send me what you’ve got,” and then you’re introduced and talking. It can be tempting to send 1,000 press kits out or tons of links on the initial email, but trust me; this gets much better results.

Also note that you’ll want to avoid links, especially considering you’ll be sending about emails in bulk. 1,000 similar emails with the same link will look really spammy to email providers, and you will probably start hitting spam folders.

#### Sending the Emails: Use Buzzstream.

#### Follow Up

Remember that running a company is a marathon, not a sprint (a startup is kind of a sprint then a marathon), and you may want to get coverage from these reporters again. So be cordial, don’t burn any bridges, and be grateful if anyone writes about you.
