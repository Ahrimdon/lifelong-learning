# How We Got Our First 100 Customers
[link](https://baremetrics.io/blog/first-100-customers)

What I didn't do: Collecting email addresses/blogging/landing page/private beta/free accounts/coupons/influencers/press releases. These have the potential the work, in the way that you have the potential to win the lottery.

The secret weapon was Twitter. Baremetrics has no free plan, no free trial, and the average customer pays nearly $70/month. It has nothing to do with the number of Twitter followers. Twitter is the "what" only, not the "why".

What drove word of mouth was *pain*. Pain is inefficient. We avoid it all costs. Solving a major pain for any business means direct access to their pocket book.

People spent hours every week using spreadsheets or hacking around the Stripe API. These metrics are critical to their business, so the instant a solution showed up that saved them hours of time, they jumped at it.

C*What made this particular solution conducive to sharing was the immediacy of the solution. Baremtrics has no setup process. No settings to fiddle with. No code to integrate with your app. You click ne button and you get a dashboard full of meaningful metrics.*

You don't have to wait for events to roll in so you have data to calculate days or months later. You instantly gain insight in to your entire history with Stripe, insight that many of our customers have never seen before in any capacity.

*The quickest way to make this happen, that requires the least amount of work, is changing your messaging. The way you position your product. Make it directly address the pain your potential customers are having and make the choice to use you so obvious, they can't deny it. Because remember, when people have a huge pain solved, they talk about it. They want to help other people get rid of that pain.*

Long term, this is a core-business issue. If your product is just a "nice to have", you'll perpetually struggle to get customers. Getting customers at any price-point higher than $20 is borderline impossible.

At the core of your business, you need to do at least one of the following in a major way:

- Save time
- Save money
- Create value (print money)

*Baremetrics does all three. We save businesses the time of manually entering data in their spreadsheets, we save them money from having to develop their own solution, and we create value by giving them financial insight in to their business that they didn't have before. The combination of doing all three is what's a big win for us and why getting those first customers (at a "premium" price point) was relatively easy and done all via word-of-mouth.*

How did I know Baremetrics would solve a major pain? *The most efficient way I've found is talking to real, live humans. Not blogging, not tweeting, not shooting a mass email out to a list asking what problem they want solved.*

Then, launch something as quick as humanly possible. Baremetrics was built in 8 days and the first $2000 in monthly recurring revenue came from that.

Then iterate based on feedback you get from *paying* customers. If you can't get anyone to pay, then it's possible you haven't solved a legitimate pain. Money is only validation at this stage.

# How Hacker News Generate $1,500 in Monthly Recurring Revenue

Anyone who's ever had anything on the front page of Hacker News will likely tell you that, with the exception of an influx of traffic, it has no noticeable impact on business. What made this instance so different?

*I think it has to do with the article focusing on businesses and people that actually have money.* Most startup/entrepreneurial content on Hacker News evolves around doing things any startup can take a stab at regardless of the stage of their business. This article was useless to most people. *Businesses with real money pay for solutions to real problems.* It's not that Hacker News doesn't have any legitimate business owners that can convert to paying customers, it's that most of the content that gets posted there targets the wrong people (the "early stage startups" and "wantrepreneurs" with no money who argue about inconsequential things) while the real business owners are out building real businesses.

Write for businesses with real money. There are all sorts of reasons for writing and not everything you write needs to have the goal of converting people to paying customers. But writing without some specific goal can also be a waste of your time.

*If Hacker News is part of your content marketing game plan, then you should be intentional about it. Write and focus on providing value for people who actually have money to spend.*

# How Retargeting Gets our SaaS $650 for $
[link](https://baremetrics.io/blog/saas-retargeting)

Retargeting is a type of online advertising that resurfaces your brand/product around the web after a user has visited your site. After you've visited Baremetrics, you'll start seeing Baremetrics ads on other sites around the web, such as Facebook.

The idea is that once you've expressed some level of interest in Baremetrics, you're much more likely to become a paying customer.

Most people don't really notice or pay much attention to ads. To make people take notice and take action, you need to make it clear it's worth their while. *You need a strong value proposition.* If the value you're bringing to the table isn't immediately obvious, you'll need to do a lot more work and you're at risk of blowing a large amount of cash if you're not careful.

Better to sell value and not the product itself.

Retargeting has worked for Baremetrics because it is immediately recognized as a much needed solution to a big problem. Stripe offers little on the metrics side, so pretty much and SaaS Stripe user has a need for Baremetrics. They've also though about adding metrics, and have failed. *They are aware taht the problem Baremetrics is solvign is a major pain point. They've felt the pain and the solution to that pain is immediately obvious.*

Someone finds their way to the Baremetrics site, reads about the product, loves the idea, but gets distracted or isn't convinced the premium price is worth it. But because they are constantly reminded of that pain, it takes relatively little work to get them to convert. They just need to be reminded of their pain. *Their pain is blatant and Baremetrics is a no-hassle fix.*
