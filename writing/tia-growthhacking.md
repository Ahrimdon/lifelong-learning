## Growth Hacking 101: Grow Your Startup with Tech and Hustle

Hi! I'm Daryll, a software developer for [iCPA: I Can Pass Accounting!](https://icpa.ph) iCPA is an online reviewer for the accounting board exam in the Philippines. Over the past month, we've tripled our user base with very minimal effort using growth hacking.

Growth hacking is a familiar buzzword  in the startup scene. [It's about using a combination of technology, creativity, and social metrics to sell products and gain exposure.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking) Familiar names include [Andrew Chen](http://andrewchen.co/) and [Sean Ellis](http://www.startup-marketing.com/).

Let's start!

#### Ride on existing networks.

Find out where the majority of your users hang out, whether it's a forum, an open Facebook group, or a real-life community. Get to those channels! A classic growth hacking example is the story of how [AirBnb leveraged Craigslist to spread itself](http://davegooden.com/2011/05/how-airbnb-became-a-billion-dollar-company/). People who posted apartment rental ads would receive emails advertising AirBnb as another way of promotion.

Was it shady? I'll leave it to you for discussion. But it did play a role in increasing AirBnB's user base.

In iCPA, we are fortunate to have an existing distribution network already (the schools). We also looked for Facebook groups and Twitter accounts with a huge amount of accounting students. We not only followed their accounts, we followed their followers too. We also posted on Internet forums where we knew accounting students hung out on.

#### Use network effects.

Once you've found your users via distribution networks, find a way to get your users to do your marketing for you via [network effects](http://www.startupdefinition.com/network-effect). What good would the user get from sharing your product?

In the early days of social gaming, Zynga not only rode on Facebook's platform, but they also leveraged Facebook notifications as a way of spreading its product. Its users were encouraged to send friend notifications in exchange for free in-game items.

Dropbox makes sure you spread the word by giving you free storage space per referral. They do give away something for, but the person might share it to someone else who is willing to pay for the product.

How can you get your users to share the news for you?

#### Add shareable content.

This is where great content writers and designers help. Users love sharing helpful content and infographics. Give your users multiple excuses to share your product. Leverage this!

You can ask them to [tweet about your product](http://www.paywithatweet.com/) or answer a short customer validation survey. To supercharge sharing, you can create paid content such as a helpful eBook (it doesn't need to be too long) and incentivize the user for sharing by offering the eBook for free.

A positive side effect of this is that you'll get to hit long-tail queries for SEO purposes.

This also gives you an excuse to promote yourself on your channels via "New blog post!" notifications.

In iCPA, our students can share their quiz results if they get a high grade. It's pleasantly surprising for them, and free marketing for us.

#### It requires coordination with the different departments.

Growth hacking is an engineering + marketing + design job. AirBnb Engineers had to figure out how to spam Craigslist because Craigslist didn't have an API. Content writers have to deliver on the content because it's getting harder to get people to share nowadays. As for design, the UX guys have to find the sweet spot so users can share the content but not get too overwhelmed with the share buttons.

It's a group effort, but it's fun! One last thing though, you have to measure your metrics. Growth hacking means a lot of experiments: many fail, but we want to learn something from our efforts. In a way, it's one of the fun things about startups: you get to test stuff a lot and see what works and what doesn't!
