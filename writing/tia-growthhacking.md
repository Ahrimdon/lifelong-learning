## 5 minute dive into growth hacking



1. Levereage existing networks.

Your cx has to be SOMEWHERE. and peleasze, dont say Fb because it has to be somewhere more specific. Honeslty, wo browses fan pages of companies they liked? If you'regoing with an FB strategy, tyou have  to make it somehting like a specifc group, or a specific time. Otherwise you're just wasting thime.

We were fortunate that accounting students were already close knit. so we simply build on existing infrasttuetutre taht was created .in this case it was: the twitter account @accountancypbroblems, aaccounting oganiations, and schools. instead of acquirine one cx at a time, we get by the hundreds.

2. shareable content. 

hotmail thing, the very nature of email is to share stuff. in paypal, they were literally sharing money, you can get money but you need to sign up for account. who the heck doesn't need money?

content doubles as a fork for keywords and seo. :)

3. network effects

think groupon and shit. you're incentivized to share a product with another person if you get an additional benefit when multiple people are joined. ex: dropbox grwoth thing. 

ideally you should offer somethign for free. dropbox: storage space. codeschool/atlassian, it was free days on the platform. it should be something that isn't a big-ass investment on them, but at least has a 

4. don't be afraid to push things out there

guy kawasaki thing. you've probably watched that add a billion times and you hate it every time. but you still sort of remember it years later even if you've never used the product. this is because good 

5. every little thing adds up...

just understand taht each of the methods used in gh probably won't add people that much. a guest post on a famous person's blog might bring a 1% increase, a "tweet since you liked this content" might bring a 1%, a global email, 2%, . for example moz had this thing called "the guide on SEO", which probably cost a ton of time to produce, 





Hiring 101 for Tech Startups: How to Craft A Careers Page That Attracts The Right People


 2 2  0
Searching for top talent for your tech startup takes more than just slapping on a job ad with HIRING on all caps.

The tables have turned as companies now focus on boosting their employer brand to attract the best talent. In a survey conducted on the value and importance of employer branding, LinkedIn discovered that 83% agree that this is essential to hiring the best talent with 69% making it their top priority as an organization.

This is because today’s professionals are much more inclined to work for a company with an attractive and engaging employer brand. They want to be a part of a team that cares for their members, shares their values and ideals, and possesses a company culture that allows everyone to grow and thrive.

With this in mind, you as a startup should focus your efforts on building an ideal employer brand as well—not just to find the qualified and the skilled, but the people who will believe in your product and your company.

It isn’t enough to just hire a UX guy and expect him to stick around and work on your product. You need to be clear about who you are, who you are looking for, the skills you are after, and how you intend to make the working experience worthwhile for everyone.

Crafting The Best Careers Page
One of the best places to start is your own careers page. More than just to check in on available positions, this is where interested applicants learn about you as an employer.

Let’s take a look at what tech companies around the world have done to inform and attract potential hires.

1. Define your company culture.
Culture, in the most basic sense, is about your employees and the values and practices each person shares within the company. It’s not about religion, geography, or socio-cultural tradition. It’s how you’d like your team to feel and perform when sitting down to work.

And so culture that sustains employee enthusiasm and happiness promotes high productivity, prevent low turnover rates and mediocre results in the long run.

Defining and exemplifying your company culture tells job seekers upfront how you run your ship.

When you put a focus on culture, you’ll have guiding principles. People will know you for this. Employees will live by it. It’ll help get you through difficult times. You’ll base hiring and firing decisions on the principles. It’ll help get all employees working on the same company mission. In some sense, it’s the glue that keeps the company together. — Zach Bulygo, “The 4 Elements That Make Great Company Culture” (

On their careers page, you’ll find HubSpot’s culture code seated in a prominent place for job seekers to read and evaluate.

It clearly defines who they are as a company—”We strive to be different.“—and their most important values. They believe in transparency, that customers are their main priority, and that they have full trust in their ability to make good decisions that lead to good results.

Any qualified job seeker who relates and believes in the same principles would be inclined to work for them. If accepted, they’d walk through the HubSpot doors knowing that their job, above all else, is to help organizations “get more customers and grow.” This reduces friction from the get go.

2. An engaging job description.
Gone are the days when a robotic job description is all it takes to attract potential hires. If you want job seekers to even pay attention to your job ad, you’ll need to speak to them as human beings do.

Take a look at ooomf’s job description on AngelList. Under Why Us?, you can instantly pick up on their friendly, enthusiastic, and flexible company personality based on the description’s tone and style.

The call to action at the end works just as well to encourage talent to apply as their true selves:

“If you’d like to apply, get out your resume, throw it away, and talk to us like we’re human. Send us something cool you made or a long rant on how terrible the freelancing process is right now and how, if you ruled the world, everything would be better.“

In short, speak to your potential hires. Let your personality as a startup shine through your job description, instead of just blaring through an invisible megaphone calling out for resumes.

To bump things up even more, you can talk about the benefits and perks of working for your startup. The benefits don’t have to be extravagant, but write it in such a way that it excites the candidate.

Take cues from Dropbox’s jobs page where you’ll find their Benefits & Perks list. It’s creative, it speaks human language, and it makes you want to drool over your screen.

3. Write clear-cut roles and responsibilities.
Along with a great job description is a list of roles and job requirements.

This is the most crucial section of your careers page because it clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of the candidate and sets the proper expectations. Knowing exactly where your potential candidate stands within the startup prevents tasks and responsibilities from overlapping, which can cause serious delay in production.

You can take on different approaches. For 6Wunderkinder, it’s a two-column description of who they are looking for and what the chosen applicant will be doing (check out their job post for a Senior Javascript Developer) . For Uber, it’s a full list of what the candidate will do, what they will need to get hired, and the perks that go with the package (see what their next Executive Assistant is expected to do).

4. Give your careers page the complete make-over.
A careers page is more than just your online job bulletin board. More than anything, it creates an impression on potential applicants that either encourages them to apply or drives them away.

With that said, don’t slack off on your careers page’s look and feel. Create a careers page that best represents your company and the culture you adhere to. This means investing time and resources in design and user experience.

Carrot Creative, known for its all-time low turnover rate of 3%, shows its future hires exactly what it means to be a world-class digital media agency through their careers page. Scroll down to see jet-powered rockets hovering over New York, each labeled with a department and job badges to indicate the number of open job vacancies.

And as you click on a particular job description, you’re sent flying into outer space where you’ll find a well-crafted job role description and criteria. If you’d like to head back down to earth, just click on that cool astronaut to your left.

5. Make it dead simple to contact you.
A careers page is useless if it takes an applicant forever to contact you. They’ll simply give up, leave your website, and move on to the next company.

Guide your potential hires to your intended line of communication and make it crazy easy to contact you. You want these people to be on your team right away before they decide to take their expertise elsewhere.

On Buffer’s job page for their next Content Crafter, all you had to do is send an email with links to your best works. Just click the “Get in touch” button or email Leo directly.

If you need much more information about the person, you can do what Twitter’s doing. Resumes must be uploaded, but candidates have the option to link their LinkedIn profiles and upload/paste their cover letters and attachments before sending in their application.

The Right Hires = Startup Success
The success of any tech startup depends on the people behind your product and brand. If you have plans of bringing someone new to the team, take these extra steps to ensure that your careers page attracts the best people both for the job and the company.
