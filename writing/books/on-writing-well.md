# On Writing Well

# 8: Unity

- *If you went to work for a newspaper that required you to write two or three articles every day, you would be a better writer after six months. You wouldn't necessarily be writing well, but you would be exercising your power of putting the English language on paper, gaining confidence and identifying the most common problems.*
- ***All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. It may be a problem of where to obtain the facts or how to organize the material. Whatever it is, it has to be confronted and solved.***
- Unity: keeps the reader from straggling off in all directions; it satisfies your readers' subconscious need for order and reassures them that all is well at the helm.
  - Unity of pronoun.
  - Unity of tense.
  - Unity of mood.
  - Ex: Reminiscing into travel brochure presentation into fun shit into being a guidebook.
- What kind of article are you writing?
  - In what capacity am I going to address the reader?
  - What pronoun and tense am I going to use?
  - What style?
  - What attitude am I going to take toward the material?
  - How much do I want to cover?
  - What point do I want to make?
- *Decide on one point you want to leave in the reader's mind.*
  - You can use earnestness, understatement, or humor.
- Don't become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprints.

# 9: The Lead and the Ending

- Lead: Tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read it. But don't dwell on the reason, coax the reader a little more keep him inquisitive.
- "I've often wondered what goes into a hot dog. Now I know and I wish I didn't."
- "By any reasonable standard, nobody would want to look twice-or even once-at the piece of slippery elm bark from..."
- *Collect more material than you will use. Every article is strong in proportion to the surplus of details from which you can choose the few that will serve you best.*
- "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
- "In the summer of the Roman year 699, now described as the year 55 before the birth of Christ, the Proconsul of Gaul, Gaius Julius Caesar, turned his gaze upon Britain."
- "Put this puzzle together and you will find milk, cheese and eggs, meat, fish, beans and cereals, greens, fruits and root vegetables-foods that contain our essential daily needs."
- "To the Manus native the world is a great platter, curving upwards on all sides, from his flat lagoon village where the pile-houses stand up like long-legged birds, placid and unstirred by the changing tides."
- "You know more than you think you do."
- Failure to know where that sentence should occur can wreck an article that until its final stage has been tightly constructed.
- ***If you're ready to stop, stop. If you've presented all the facts and made the point you want to make, look for the nearest exit.***
- Ending: What usually works is a quotation.

# 10: Bits & Pieces

- ***Verbs***
  - Use active words unless there is no comfortable way to get around a passive verb.
    - "He was seen by Joe." â†’ How often was he seen by Joe? Lol.
  - Verbs push the sentence forward and give it momentum. Active words also enable us to visualize an activity because they require a noun to put it in motion.
  - Use precise verbs. Did he step down, or did he resign/retire/get fired?
- ***Adverbs.***
  - Usually unnecessary. Don't "blare loudly", don't "clench tightly". Strong verbs are usually weakened by redundant adverbs. "Effortlessly easy", "slightly spartan", "totally flabbergasted".
  - What does "arguably" mean? Lol.
- ***Adjectives.***
  - No "yellow daffodils" please.
  - Make your adjectives do work that needs to be done. "He looked at the gray sky and the black clouds and decided to sail back to the harbor."
- ***Little qualifiers.***
  - "A bit", "a little", "sort of", "kind of", "rather", "quite", "very", "too", "pretty much", "in a sense", and dozens more.
  - Don't say you were a bit confused and sort of tired and a little depressed and somewhat annoyed. Be confused. Be tired. Be depressed. Be annoyed. Don't hedge your prose with little timidities. Good writing is lean and confident.
- ***Mood changers.***
  - Learnt to alert the reader as soon as possible to any change in mood from the previous sentence. "But", "yet", "however", "nevertheless", "still", "instead", "thus", "therefore", "meanwhile", "now", "later", "today", "subsequently".
- ***That and which.***
  - Whatever.








































# 14: Writing About Yourself: The Memoir

- "No teacher wants twenty-five copies of the same person, writing about the same topic. We look for individuality."
- *If you consciously write for a teacher or for an editor, you'll end up not writing for anybody. If you write for yourself, you'll reach the people you want to write for.*
- The problem with students who "have to write what the teacher wants", what they mean is they don't have anything to say because their after-school existence is bound by television and the mall.
- *Make sure every component in your memoir is doing useful work. Write about yourself, but see that all the details (people, places, events, anecdotes, ideas, emotions) are moving your story steadily alone.*
- Memoirs: the narrowness of their focus. Unlike the autobiography, which spans an entire life, a memoir assumes the life and ignores most of it.
- Crucial ingredient: describing people.
- *The best gift you have to offer when you write personal history is the gift of yourself. Give yourself permission to write about yourself, and have a good time doing it.*
