- "I didn't get my wine, but at least I crashed a wedding."
- Step out of the comfort zone, do something outre.

- Faulkner: "A writer needs three things--experience, observation, and imagination."
- Hemingway = World War I, skied the Alps, hunted lions in Africa, ran with bulls in Pamplona...
- Writers take chances.

- Know thyself. What makes you mad, what does your wild side look like, what do you do for fun? Fears are only thoughts, but the world is thrillingly real.

- Do something that makes y our palms sweat. Go to a busy street corner and start orating about something. Express a strong opinion. Ex: busking for money in a street corner.
- Eavesdrop. Ex: she eavesdropped near a Starbucks, with young men and older women, it turns out this is in front of an armed forces recruitment center.
- Do something repugnant to you. Strip club, stadium-sized churches, mediums, nursing homes, whatever.
