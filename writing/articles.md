## The Day You Became A Better Writer
[Reference](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)

- I went from being a bad writer to a good writer after taking a one-day course in “business writing.”
- Simple means getting rid of extra words. Don’t write, "He was very happy" when you can write "He was happy." You think the word “very” adds something. It doesn't. Prune your sentences.
- Humor writing is a lot like business writing. It needs to be simple. The main difference is in the choice of words. For humor, don’t say “drink” when you can say “swill.”
- **Your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Go back and read my first sentence to this post. I rewrote it a dozen times. It makes you curious. That’s the key.**
- Learn how brains organize ideas. Readers comprehend “the boy hit the ball” quicker than “the ball was hit by the boy.” Both sentences mean the same, but it’s easier to imagine the object (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way. (Notice I didn't say, “That is the way all brains work”?)

- `natha105`:
  - Once you have written, then you edit.
  - When I edit, I ask myself about every word in every sentence. What is this word doing? Is it needed? Could it be doing more than one thing at a time?
  - Biggest red flags: the word "quickly".
  - Editing is an active process and being self aware about your issues is important.
  - Rewrite and revise things.
- `rrauwl`
  - Shakespeare: When you read the sentence structure of those who intentionally impose limitations upon themselves, you can learn an awful lot.
  - Imagine for a moment that you had to tell the same story, but in a different pentameter.

  - How to Write a Sentence. Save great sentences you find.
  - "If a man walks in dressed like a hick and acting as if he owned the place, he's a spaceman." → "If a cat paces in tail up and battle scared, it's a tom."
  - By studying sentences, you can start to recognize the types. Additive: "In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels." - A Farewell to Arms, Hemingway.
  - Subordinated: "When the porter's wife announced, "A gentleman--with a lady, sir", I had, as I often had in those days, for the wish was father to the though, an immediate vision of sitter."
- `nastyjman`:
  - Copywork. Copy a chapter or page from your favorite book.
- `theballa_`:
  - You could just change the subject of the sentence.
  - "Breakfast was good." "I bought some shoes." "My wallet cried out as I spent another $100 on some sneakers."
- `Xatres17`:
  - Sentence structure drill: 1 paragraph starting with a noun, one starting with a verb, one starting with a preposition, one compound sentence, one short sentence, one long sentence.

# A style guide for writing on Medium
[Reference](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-style-guide-for-writing-on-medium-fcbad27492ea)

- Headlines: Don't use clickbait, listicles, but do tell the truth. Don't do "Part 1". If the headline is too long, Medium will truncate it.
- Images: stick to column width.
- High-resolution image at the top of a story under your headline.
  - When people share your story on Facebook and Twitter, it will be more prominent in news feeds.
- Attribution:
  - "Image credit", and link the text to its original source. You can tell Google to only show images which have been labeled for reuse.
  - Always attribute quotes to the people who said them. If multi-line quote, use Medium's pull quotes.
- Code: Use Github Gist.
- Bold to emphasize. Italics are harder to read.
- "For example" vs "e.g.", "that is" vs "i.e.", "note that" instead of "N.B", "like" instead of "etc.".
- Use a period instead of semicolons.
- Style: Hemingway app. Err on the side of breaking long sentences. Use contractions. Keep your tense consistent. Refer to the reader as "you". Front-end development means you're working on the front end.
- Notes like: "published at my blog", put on the bottom.
