- Prepare an outline of the content you are going to write as a series of questions.
- Once I defined the questions, I wrote in sprints without correcting grammar or spelling to answer each of the questions. Sprints were a few minutes, not more than 5.
- When I answered all of the questions I would go back and remove the questions and edit for flow and add references and supporting facts. Last would be a grammar check, but I relied on my editor to review that given that I was often writing on deadline.
- The author was really all about hacking an expert-looking book in the shortest time possible - without calling it hacking. The process started by reading the top 10 books in your field, then develop 25 core questions, fill each question with 5 sub questions, use a timer of 5 minutes to write against the clock the answer to that question. The idea was to get into a writing flow and stop reflecting while putting out as much text as possible. He sold the idea by the good old pareto logic, suggesting that by reading the top 10 books you already know more than 80% of the people interested in the topic, making the book good enough to be seen as the expert. In the end he suggested threwing out 10% of the worst paragraphs, then editing it all together and done is the book.
- In my own experiences, the key to writing essays quickly and expertly is just writing a lot of essays and consciously trying to hone your craft. Writing is a complex skill that takes lots of time and attention in little incremental steps, and the further you go the faster/better you get.
- Certainly there's real technique to writing quickly, but I've always found that my own biggest barrier was having something meaningful to say, and the fastest way to get into a rhythm of actually coming up with meaningful things to say was to just start putting words down in the first place. Which leads to the paradox: you become prolific by trying to be prolific.
- Essay structure:
  - Introduce a problem/concept.
  - Define/explain what it is.
  - Give several examples or studies.
  - Add an intro that grabs attention and promises value.
- Just like coding:
  - Read and write a lot.
  - Have models to emulate.
  - Learn the rules.
  - Clearly structure your sentences, paragraphs, and larger semantic units.
  - Vary word use, sentence length, phrase structure, rhythm.
  - Don't be a pompous ass.
