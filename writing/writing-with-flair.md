## Writing With Flair

- Simplicity, clarity (no one rereads your stuff), and elegance (pacing sentences and putting ideas together).
- Capture interest, clear expression, and the writing flows. Bad writing: boring, full of ambiguities and clunky.
- Reasons
  - To inform.
  - To entertain.
  - To persuade.
  - To inspire.
- Attention to detail: every word.
- Intention to connect: who they are and who they represent.
- Keep things real. Don't use words which are too fancy. The aim is to communicate, not to impress.
- Presentation is slick.
- The "Never repeat" principle should be dropped when you need to repeat things lol.

## Simplicity

- Shorter words: "use" vs "utilize", "show" vs "demonstrate", "commence" vs "start". Though you don't want to repeat words too much.
- Use as few words as possible to expose an idea. "investigate" vs "conducting an investigation", "tends to" vs "has a tendency to", "many" vs "a large number of", "unexpected surprise (?)", "joint collaboration", "future plans", "new record", "continues to maintain" doesn't need "maintain".
- Any word that can go, must go.
- "companies like `ASX`, which is Australia's" -> "like `ASX`, Australia's"
- "you know good writing the moment you see it because you find you can connect with it instantly" -> "you connect instantly with good writing".
- Repetition: "1 in 3, or 33%".
- Double negatives = unnecessary strain.
- "revenues" vs "revenue" or "profits vs "profit". Remove the s if you don't really need them. Always think of the shortest, fastest form.
- Plainer, don't bullshit.
- TMI?
