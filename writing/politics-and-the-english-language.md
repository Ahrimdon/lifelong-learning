## Politics and the English Language, Written by George Orwell
[Reference](https://biblio.wiki/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language)

- Stale imagery, lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not.
- This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of prose and writing.
- **As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract. Prose becomes less of words chosen for the sake of meaning, and more of phrases tacked together.**
- Dying metaphors: these are metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves.  RING THE CHANGES ON, TAKE UP THE CUDGELS FOR, TOE THE LINE, RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH, PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF, AN AXE TO GRIND, GRIST TO THE MILL, FISHING IN TROUBLED WATERS, ON THE ORDER OF THE DAY, ACHILLES' HEEL, SWAN SONG, HOTBED.
- Operators/verbal false limbs: redundant. RENDER INOPERATIVE, MILITATE AGAINST, PROVE UNACCEPTABLE, MAKE CONTACT WITH, BE SUBJECTED TO, GIVE RISE TO, GIVE GROUNDS FOR, HAVING THE EFFECT OF, PLAY A LEADING PART (RÃ”LE) IN, MAKE ITSELF FELT, TAKE EFFECT, EXHIBIT A TENDENCY TO, SERVE THE PURPOSE OF.
- Pretentious diction. PHENOMENON, ELEMENT, INDIVIDUAL (as noun), OBJECTIVE, CATEGORICAL, EFFECTIVE, VIRTUAL, BASIS, PRIMARY, PROMOTE, CONSTITUTE, EXHIBIT, EXPLOIT, UTILIZE, ELIMINATE, LIQUIDATE.
- Meaningless words. Words like ROMANTIC, PLASTIC, VALUES, HUMAN, DEAD, SENTIMENTAL, NATURAL, VITALITY, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader.
- As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. IN MY OPINION IT IS A NOT UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSUMPTION THAT than over I THINK.
- **The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.** When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns, as it were instinctively, to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as "keeping out of politics." When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer.
- A NOT UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSUMPTION, LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED, WOULD SERVE NO GOOD PURPOSE, A CONSIDERATION WHICH WE SHOULD DO WELL TO BEAR IN MIND. These suck.
- **What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about.** In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is to surrender them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualizing, you probably hunt about till you find the exact words that seem to fit it.
- Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism. Since you don't know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism?
-  If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.

- Rules:
  - Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
  -  Never use a long word where a short one will do.
  - If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
  - Never use the passive where you can use the active.
  - Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
  - Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.

- A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus:
  - What am I trying to say?
  - What words will express it?
  - What image or idiom will make it clearer?
  - Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?
  - Could I put it more shortly?
  - Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?
