## The Day You Became A Better Writer
[Reference](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)

- I went from being a bad writer to a good writer after taking a one-day course in “business writing.”
- Simple means getting rid of extra words. Don’t write, "He was very happy" when you can write "He was happy." You think the word “very” adds something. It doesn't. Prune your sentences.
- Humor writing is a lot like business writing. It needs to be simple. The main difference is in the choice of words. For humor, don’t say “drink” when you can say “swill.”
- **Your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Go back and read my first sentence to this post. I rewrote it a dozen times. It makes you curious. That’s the key.**
- Learn how brains organize ideas. Readers comprehend “the boy hit the ball” quicker than “the ball was hit by the boy.” Both sentences mean the same, but it’s easier to imagine the object (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way. (Notice I didn't say, “That is the way all brains work”?)

  - Once you have written, then you edit.
  - When I edit, I ask myself about every word in every sentence. What is this word doing? Is it needed? Could it be doing more than one thing at a time?
  - Biggest red flags: the word "quickly".
  - Editing is an active process and being self aware about your issues is important.
  - Rewrite and revise things.

  - "If a man walks in dressed like a hick and acting as if he owned the place, he's a spaceman." → "If a cat paces in tail up and battle scared, it's a tom."
  - By studying sentences, you can start to recognize the types. Additive: "In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels." - A Farewell to Arms, Hemingway.
  - Subordinated: "When the porter's wife announced, "A gentleman--with a lady, sir", I had, as I often had in those days, for the wish was father to the though, an immediate vision of sitter."

  - Copywork. Copy a chapter or page from your favorite book.

  - You could just change the subject of the sentence.
  - "Breakfast was good." "I bought some shoes." "My wallet cried out as I spent another $100 on some sneakers."

  - Sentence structure drill: 1 paragraph starting with a noun, one starting with a verb, one starting with a preposition, one compound sentence, one short sentence, one long sentence.
