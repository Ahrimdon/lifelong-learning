## How To Blog For Profit (Without Selling Your Soul)

- Blogging: I can do what I like (cooking, cleaning, crafting, organizing, writing)--and still give me the flexibility to stay at home with my kids or to literally work from anywhere.
- Blogging is incredibly personal. Your readers don't just come to read what you have to write, they come for you, for your unique voice, perspective, and ideas.
- *The secret to successfully blogging for profit is learning how to maintain authenticity with your readers while at the same time navigating the behind-the-scenes waters of running a business and building a brand.*
- I wrote about the things I was most passionate about, not carrying whether I was saying the "right" things, the "popular" things, or even the "profitable" things.

### Content is King

- Editorial calendar: a simple document with a list of posts and other writing assignments due that day.
- Posts are written 3-4 weeks in advance. It is sometimes necessary to shuffle things around, depending on circumstances, but I have found that having a clear plan for what is coming up allows me to be more efficient with my time.
- Once or twice a month, I will set aside an hour to brainstorm as many post ideas as possible.
- The Discipline of Writing: LOTS of practice.
- Each morning, force yourself to write a certain number of words and don't stop until you've met your goal.
- Writing group so you can get honest feedback and constructive criticism.
- Killer blog post:

  - Evokes an emotional response.
  - Is easy to read.

  - Not overly complicated.
  - Makes you say, "wow".
  - Empowers the reader.

- Pillar content: the blog posts that draw traffic, popular posts.
- Brainstorming at least once a month.

### Presentation is Everything

- Is some aspect of your design holding you back? Is it too cluttered, too garish, or too confusing?
- Does your design tell newcomers what your blog is about?
- Make sure your best content is highlighted in a way that stands out to people, and make it available to them in as many ways as you can.
- Have pinnable photos enhancing every single blog post.
- Photography, staging, and photo editing.
- Images:
  - Colorful images over monochromatic.
  - Bright images over dark.

  - Pins without faces. And the pins can have the name of the thing or some text.
