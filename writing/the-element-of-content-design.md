## Basic Principles

* Good content is appropriate: Publish content that is right for the user and for the business.
* It helps users accomplish their goals.
* It makes them feel like geniuses on critically important missions.
* Context specific
* Helps goals: Increases sales, improves tech support service, reduces printing costs for educational materials.
* Ex: Instead of “sell stuff”, how about “show how this product helps nurse practitioners”.
* Good content is user-centered: Use the clients’ internal mental methods and vocabulary.

## The Craft of Content Strategy

* Stories matter: Humans are compulsive storytellers. The thinkers who change opinions can tell a great story.
* Important information at the start.
* What happened, who is involved, when and where, why, how.
* Show, don’t tell.
* Rhetoric (Aristotle)
* Rational argument: We will produce these benefits.
* Emotional appeal: Happy memories are the most precious things in our brief, sad, lives. Won’t you buy this widget to make you some happy memories?
* Speaker’s reputation: As a thought leader, I tell you: buy this.
