## Which words stand out?
- *You and Your*: Content's No.1 goal is to help other people. Make content about the reader, not about the writer. Ex: "What would you buy with an extra $12,000?, A Chart About Silence That Will Leave You Speechless, 6 Things You Need to Know Today".
- *This*: The power of "this" is its specificity. When you use "this" in a headline, the reader's mind switches to a concrete view of whatever you are talking about. Ex: "This Guy Sticks Household Objects in His Beard and It's Weirdly Mesmerizing"
- *What*, *Which*, *When*: They are all about questions. Phrasing headlines in the form of a question more than doubles them. Ex: "Which Countries Pay Its Teachers What They're Worth?, Which Old-School Pro Wrestling Legend are You?"
- *Why*: "Why" promises and explanation. Finding out "why" is satisfying to us because of a phenomenon called the curiosity gap. We have an itch in our brain regarding what we know and what we want to know. Ex: "Why Your Brand Shouldn't Fear Assigning Authorship, Why So Many Creatives Love Working on Trains"
- *People*: This is the number 1 uncommon word in the study. Ex: "The most successful people, the happiest people". The superlatives in these headlines make promises that the reader finds intriguing. We want to know what the most successful people are doing, how the happiest people live, and what makes the most interesting people interesting. Readers enjoy discovering, learning, and challenging the details behind blanket assertions like this.
- *Video*: Being up front that your post contains video is a good tactic to use when writing your headline. Ex: "Why You Should Listen First, Market Later (Video)".

## The most common viral headline phases
- "this is", "in the", "how to", "is the", "of the", "the most", "on the", "when you", "you see", "in a", "what happened", "this guy", "that will", "at the", "to be", "to the", "the best", "make you"
- *The most*: There is a certain level of authority. You also tap into a reader's argumentative side, giving them an opportunity to challenge you.
