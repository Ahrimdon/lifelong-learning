# How to Write a Great Headline: The Top Words Used in Viral Headlines
[Link](http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-most-popular-words-in-most-viral-headlines?)

## Which words stand out?
- *You and Your*: Content's No.1 goal is to help other people. Make content about the reader, not about the writer. Ex: "What would you buy with an extra $12,000?, A Chart About Silence That Will Leave You Speechless, 6 Things You Need to Know Today".
- *This*: The power of "this" is its specificity. When you use "this" in a headline, the reader's mind switches to a concrete view of whatever you are talking about. Ex: "This Guy Sticks Household Objects in His Beard and It's Weirdly Mesmerizing"
- *What*, *Which*, *When*: They are all about questions. Phrasing headlines in the form of a question more than doubles them. Ex: "Which Countries Pay Its Teachers What They're Worth?, Which Old-School Pro Wrestling Legend are You?"
- *Why*: "Why" promises and explanation. Finding out "why" is satisfying to us because of a phenomenon called the curiosity gap. We have an itch in our brain regarding what we know and what we want to know. Ex: "Why Your Brand Shouldn't Fear Assigning Authorship, Why So Many Creatives Love Working on Trains"
- *People*: This is the number 1 uncommon word in the study. Ex: "The most successful people, the happiest people". The superlatives in these headlines make promises that the reader finds intriguing. We want to know what the most successful people are doing, how the happiest people live, and what makes the most interesting people interesting. Readers enjoy discovering, learning, and challenging the details behind blanket assertions like this.
- *Video*: Being up front that your post contains video is a good tactic to use when writing your headline. Ex: "Why You Should Listen First, Market Later (Video)".

## The most common viral headline phases
- "this is", "in the", "how to", "is the", "of the", "the most", "on the", "when you", "you see", "in a", "what happened", "this guy", "that will", "at the", "to be", "to the", "the best", "make you"
- *The most*: There is a certain level of authority. You also tap into a reader's argumentative side, giving them an opportunity to challenge you. Other post titles: smart, surprising, science, history, hacks (hacking, hacker), huge/big, critical.
- *How to*: How to is popular because it's effective. They promise a certain level of education. Other: "beginner's guide", "introductory", "in 5 minutes", showing the blog reading audience loves to learn how to as quickly as possible.
- Three-word phrases: "What happens when", "this is what". They are both explanatory and promise a certain level of discovery.

Average length of a viral headline: 62 characters.

The guys at Upworthy write 25 versions of each title. Then they chose two to A/B test. It takes discipline and a lot of practice.

## They are masters at finding common ground.

_Olympic Ice Dancing Routine Matches Up Flawlessly with Beyonce's Drunk in Love_

Olympics: Leverages a current event. Beyonce: Pop star. Drunk in Love: Top song.

*Marketing Takeaway*: Link your content to popular people or anything else that is easily recognizable by your audience. Don't force it.

## They know that curiosity is the crack rock of the Internet

_This Guy's Wife Got Cancer, So He Did Something Unforgettable. The Last 3 Photos Destroyed Me._

Got cancer: Cancer sucks. We can relate to it. Something unforgettable: What could the husband do that is so unforgettable?

*Marketing Takeaway*: Inject your titles with a high does of curiosity and back it up with great content.

## They aren't afraid of getting emotional

Humans crave the opportunity to release their emotions. Crying is beneficial (health-wise). Ex: "The Last 3 Photos Destroyed Me".

*Marketing Takeaway*: Emotion is what fuels people to click and share. Just because you have an un-emotional product or service doesn't mean that you can't leverage it in your content strategy.

1. Nobody Knows Anything: We don't know how to make your video go totally viral.
2. Virality Can Be Complex: Viral needs shares/view, and clicks/share. To get clicks, you MUST focus on headlines.
3. This Headline is More Important Than This Talk:

  - Onion: "Obama Blasts Obama's Evasive Stance on Gay Marriage". Now I know what it is.
  - Google: "Obama Says Same-Sex Marriage Should be Legal". Boring.
  - Facebook: "Now THIS Is Why I Voted for Barack Obama". WHAT IS THIS??? Click... Click...

4. Make It Easy to Share: Categor,y Headline, Lead, Content.

  Twitter likes facts.
  FB share text: "Like and share if you think..."
  Share image: Make this something human or curiosity inducing.
  Headline: 100 Character limit.
  URL: Long ones click more.
  FB description: Don't give it all away.

  Share image: Show a person saying a secret, close-up humans, put "WTF" stuff, add a hero/villain...

6. Your website is the gateway drug to sharing. Make sure it shared properly. Floating overlay links + links when highlighting = 398% increase.
7. Prioritize for where people are: Pinterest = ladies, Twitter = they like facts, Facebook = king. Need photo posts (10-30% increase in clicks, 3-4x engagement).
