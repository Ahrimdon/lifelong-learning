## 10 years of professional blogging â€“ what I've learned
[Reference](http://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/)

- Hard part: finding your voice, figuring out topics that are interesting for other folks to read, and building a long-term habit.
- Titles are 80% of the work. It has to be a compelling opinion or important learning.
- There is always room for high-quality thoughts/opinions.
- Writing is really scalable relative to events. Speaking at conferences is a huge time suck.
- Write based on a multi-decade timeframe. This is why you don't write on Medium on Quora, you write on your own thing.
- Calendar reminder: because initially, no one will read your work, the key is to just get started.
- Email subscriber = real channel. Annoying pop-ups are unfortunately effective.
- Publishing ideas/learnings is a great way to give.

## Tips for new bloggers

- Carpet bomb a key area and stake out mindshare
- Stay consistent on your blog format and topic
- Just show up
- Go deep on your topic of expertise
- Come up with new topics with brainstorms, news headlines, and note-to-self
