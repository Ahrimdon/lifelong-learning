## [What makes content spread: The anatomy of a post that got over 500,000 likes](http://blog.bufferapp.com/what-makes-content-go-viral-the-anatomy-of-a-post-that-got-over-500000-likes)

“30 Things to Stop Doing to Yourself”. Why did this post go so viral?, is what I asked Marc and Angel. We discussed a lot of different things they learnt from writing it and hundreds of other articles over the past 7 years.

1. __The science of persuasion: Nailing the fear of “missing out”.__ In my chat with Marc and Angel, one key thing they mentioned to me is that they wrote two posts. One was titled “30 Things to Start Doing for Yourself” and “30 Things to Stop Doing to Yourself”. Interestingly, the second one, using a negative “stop” or “avoid”, “don’t” and similar in other posts always performed better.
	
	If you are writing something that’s unique and people might have a feeling of otherwise missing out on, then this is a fantastic trigger to get people interested in your content.

2. __We only read 20% of web pages – make your content easy to skim read.__ we all love bite-sized information on the web. Now, a list article is the perfect format for this. A post that gives you “30 Things” is very powerful. On the one hand, you know that you can just pick out a few of the 30 things, so it is easy to skim. On the other, if all of those individual 30 points are very interesting and useful, just reading one of the 30, can be all it takes to share it with a friend.

3. __We all want to learn something and get smarter – it’s science!__ Practical utility trumps "interesting" and "surprising" when determining what is most likely to be shared.
4. __Sharing buttons make content 7 times more likely to spread.__ Prominently feature sharing buttons both before and after each post.
5. __Length of content and virality go hand in hand.__ Make sure that if you write a “30 things” list post, that your 1st point provides as much value to the reader as your 30th.
6. __Consistency and Authority – Marc and Angel have been blogging since 2006.__ This strict consistency of writing more than 1000 articles is also deeply routed in our human understanding of how we build trust. The fact that their readers can expect a high quality article every few days, makes all the difference, says science.

Especially the comment section is extremely insightful to see what people have taken away from the article.


## [10 Years of Silence: How long it took Mozart, Picasso and Kobe Bryant to be Successful](http://blog.bufferapp.com/lessons-on-success-and-deliberate-practice-from-mozart-picasso-and-kobe-bryant)

What he discovered was that virtually every single “masterwork” was written after year ten of the composer’s career. (Out of 500 pieces there were only three exceptions, which were written in years eight and nine.) Not a single person produced incredible work without putting in a decade of practice first. Even a genius like Mozart had to work for at least ten years before he produced something that became popular. Professor Hayes began to refer to this period, which was filled with hard work and little recognition, as the “ten years of silence.”

Kobe isn’t merely showing up and practicing a lot. He is practicing with purpose. When most people talk about working hard, they use the amount of time they worked as an indicator of how hard they worked. (i.e. “I worked 60 hours this week!”) The best artists, musicians, athletes, CEOs, and entrepreneurs don’t merely work a lot, they work a lot on developing specific skills.

I don’t have the natural talent of Kobe Bryant or the sheer brilliance of Mozart, but I’m willing to put in my “10 years of silence.” I’ve only been writing on this site for 9 months, but I see this as the beginning of a 30–year project for me. And because I’m in this for good, I can win with commitment, grit, and unwavering consistency.

4. __Make it scarce.__ Using negative, dark, and aggressive words in titles lead to more shares.  Including the words no, without, and stop lead to more shares that more positively framed titles using words like do or start. Another part of this finding was that aggressive or violent-sounding words encouraged more social shares, as well. For instance, words like kill, dead and fear seem to be more shareable.

## [A scientific guide to posting Tweets, Facebook posts, Emails and Blog posts at the best time](http://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-post-to-facebook-send-emails-publish-blogposts)

#### Email – find the best time to send for the right content

- 10pm–6am: This is the dead zone, when hardly any emails get opened.
- 6am–10am: Consumer-based marketing emails are best sent early in the morning.
- 10am-noon: Most people are working, and probably won’t open your email.
- Noon–2pm: News and magazine updates are popular during lunch breaks.
- 2–3pm: After lunch lots of people buckle down and ignore their inbox.
- 3–5pm: Property and financial-related offers are best sent in the early afternoon.
- 5–7pm: Holiday promotions & B2B promotions get opened mostly in the early evening.
- 7–10pm: Consumer promotions are popular again after dinner.

From 3–5pm, for instance, the reason people open financial and property-related emails is that they’re more likely to be thinking about their life situation and how to improve it. Understanding how these time blocks work can be a good start to sending your emails at just the right time.

And since 23.63% of emails are opened within an hour of being received, this is something we definitely want to get right.

For more general emails, open rates, click-through rates and abuse reports were all found to be highest during early mornings and on weekends.

In a different study by MailChimp open rates were shown to be noticeably lower on weekends.

They also found that open rates increased after 12pm, and were highest between 2pm and 5pm.

GetResponse found that Thursday is the best day for both open rates and click-throughs.

####  Blog posts – what time should you hit publish on your posts?

- 70% of users say they read blogs in the morning
- More men read blogs at night than women
- Mondays are the highest traffic days for an average blog
- 11am is usually the highest traffic hour for an average blog
- Comments are usually highest on Saturdays and around 9am on most days
- Blogs that post more than once per day have a higher chance of inbound links and more unique views

By analyzing the behavior of each individual user, eBags sent out emails to users at the same time of day they had signed up for the email list.

This actually worked incredibly well: click-through rates rose by 20% and conversion rates rose by 65%.
