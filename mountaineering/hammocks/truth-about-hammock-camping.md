## The Truth About Hammock Camping: Claim #1 – Hammocks Are Lighter Than Tents
[link](http://theultimatehang.com/2012/04/the-truth-about-hammock-camping-claim-1-hammocks-are-lighter-than-tents/)

A simple hammock is light, but to be compared with a tent, you've got to add bug net, rain fly, suspension, tree-saving straps. If you're looking for something lightweight, I recommend putting together your own kit. Smaller tarp, get a separate bug net.

Advantage over tents: modular components. Get a smaller tarp, or get a tarp with space-age Cuben Fiber, bugnet, Whoopie Sling suspension lines.

#### Hammock Comfort

Hammock comfort is a learned behavior. Unlike sleeping on a flat bed, hammocks have a way of moving, especially if you're hanging it in different places every night. Differences in hang height, distances between anchor points, and the angle of the hang can all influence the shape and lay of the hammock bed.

Problems:

- Cold butt syndrome.
- Shoulder squeeze--the sides of the hammock wrap too tightly around your shoulders, causing discomfort through the night.
- Calf pressure--some hammocks create a stiff ridge of fabric right in the center that puts pressure on your legs.
- Ankle strain--in some positions, the hammock will provide a lot of support directly under your feet, putting pressure on your heels and ankles, and can lead to leg hyperextension.
- Leg hyperextension--when you have great support under your feet, but not under your legs, you'll feel pain in your knees and legs.
- Fear of falling out.
- Motion sickness.
- Claustrophobia.
- Multiple people in one hammock.

I've experienced almost all of these discomforts while hammock camping, yet I still prefer hammocks over sleeping on the ground. *When hung correctly, hammocks offer superior comfort over a range of conditions. Comfort is the main reason people pick hammocks in the first place.* I won't deny that practice helps perfect hammock hanging, and having a mentor can really help. More often than not, the universal solution is proper hanging technique. As I mentioned before, hammocks can be finicky, and for some there is a learning curve that makes it difficult to consistently get a good hang.

Solutions:

- Cold butt syndrome: compress insulation under you. Either a sleeping bag or a fleece bag liner.
- Shoulder squeeze: change the angle of the hang (try sleeping diagonally).
- Calf pressure: sleep with your legs crossed. This creates a space for that hammock ridge to run without hitting my calf. Side sleeping also cures the calf pressure problem.
- Ankle strain/leg hyperextension: you can place a pillow under your knees.
- Fear of falling out: hang with a deep sag. To avoid sitting and falling, make sure you spread the hammock fabric WIDE and sit in the center of the hammock. Swing your legs in and lay on the diagonal.
- Motion sickness: there is evidence that the gentle swaying of a hammock is beneficial and contributes to a deeper sleep.
- Claustrophobia: use a larger bug net.
- Multiple people in one hammock.

#### Hammock Setup

Main shelter for hammocks=tarp.  At the end of the day, don't pick a hammock (or a tent) just because one side claims to pitch faster than the other. With either a tent or hammock, practice helps with proficiency, so when you have a skilled hammock hanger next to a skilled tent pitcher—both who have fine-tuned their kit—the results may be a stand-off.

Suspensions: climbing carabiners, daisy-chained tree straps, whoopie sling, Marlinespike hitch, cinch buckles, descender rings.

Pack for speed: Tarp and hammock are stowed at the top of my pack for easy access, and apart from my insulation and clothing that is stored in a waterproof bag in case I have to open my pack when it's raining. If my tarp is already wet, I store it in an outside pocket.

Tarp is last to pack so it ends up on the top of my gear, followed by my hammock. I keep my suspension packed separate from my hammock, usually in an outside pocket. The main reason is to keep the straps away from my hammock as the straps often pick up gummy tree sap or get soaked when in the rain. Keeping the straps in an outside pocket also lets me access them quickly when it's time to hang.

#### Do hammocks make you pee more at night?

Fluid buildup in the legs can be a cause, since this fluid settles once you lay down and is then processed. For those who do much hiking and backpacking, edema, or fluid buildup in the legs is quite common. In fact, hikers are often encouraged to rest and raise their legs to the level of the heart to help reduce the swelling, improve muscle recovery, and help the body process fluid buildup. Hammocks provide a recumbent-style la
