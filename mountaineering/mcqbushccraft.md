- Foam as a cushion/fanning flames.
- First aid kit: Mirror for checking yourself for bruises.
- Nalgene steel bottle. Mug should wrap around the bottle base.
- Water bottle, put a hanger so you can hang it over a pot and sterilize.
- Cotton handkerchief for filtering water.
- Do you really need a ton of cookware? Maybe you just need one cooking container. You just need water as a liquid (not caffeine). Porridge every morning and about 2-3 bananas. Some unrefined sugar, and that's my breakfast. Throughout the day, I eat trail mix. I start the day with slow-release carbohydrates. I avoid meat. I don't buy meat from the shop. The digestion time of meat is just so long that your energy levels will be sapped, especially when you're doing this sort of thing. The things that I opt for are the things that give me energy. Oats, lots of oats. Flapjack. Problem with tea and chocolate is they keep you up and down, not constant.
- For lunch, I generally roll with similar things like this. Oats, brown rice, basically foods that give you high energy levels. Same with dinner. Nuts for proteins.
- Journal. For me it is important since it is all about learning things. The field journal, I have field notes. Edible plants, medicinals. I have a notes section and a sketch section. I remember things better when I write things down.
- Gloves. For cooking, for cold weather.
- A buff. Slow filtration.
- Hatchet, got a new sheath. Put a leather over the shoulder. I baton logs, not chop them. It speeds up a lot of construction jobs. It's just a heavy cutting tool.
- Knives: "A big knife can do what a small knife does but a small knife can't do what a big knife does" might not be true occasionally. Small knife: 4 inch blade.
- Leather pouch contents
  - Pan scrubber. Valuable for cleaning pots in the river. After cleaning in a river, whisk the moisture away and then put it in the embers of the fire. You can use it to remove stains on your axe.
  - Vegetable oil/fat. You can use it for cooking, for the axe head, for leather.
  - Ferrocerium rod.
  - Beeswax for natural cordage.
  - Needle/thread.
  - Sharpening stone. (Smurf poop)

- Eddy, a bit deep, not the shallow/fast moving waters
- When raining, I don't go out, visibility is bad and your chances go down
- Clear the patches so when you throw a line, there won't be much snags
- Head of the worm on the hook
