## Al-Al/Tabayoc: September 26-27 2015

- Cooked: Garlic chicken.
- Always check your stuff, you lost your expensive cap. It's okay though--for small, easy to lose things, better to just get inexpensive options (such as buffs).
- Not having a backpack cover sucks. Now you have to clean your bag.
- First aid is really important, I'm considering moving it to pocket status.
- Once again, extra contact lens fluid? Or better if you have an extra contact lens holder, just in case the first one's lens fluid gets spilled.
- Losing the contact lens sucks, because you were forced to use eyeglasses, which made it harder to see (especially with moisture), so it was easier to get lost.
- First time to legitimately get lost. Check trail signs, stop, ALWAYS bring a whistle.
- Need to practice packing with the insulator mat you bought, it folds differently/takes up a lot of volume. Consider getting a rubber foam (much thinner).
- Levelled up in terms of instinct when going down. More practice is needed.
- No need to bring the assault pack up Al-Al, you could have just left it. As a result it was harder to pack stuff :(
- Don't bring too much food :(

## Purgatory (UPM Induction): August 29-31 2015

- Cooked: Chicken Salpicao, Sausage Surprise.
- Easier if 2 small tents than 1 big tent to distribute weight.
- 1 2-3 person cookset is enough for 4 people. But the problem with a small cookset is that the food inside is hard to cook if there are big cuts since the cookset is so small, so the spices don't mix.
- Check the ultralight containers to ensure they don't spill since your Salpicao sauce got spilled.
- When preparing a meal, always have a head chef for a specific meal and defer to their decisions so we don't have a "too many cooks" situation.
- If you bring petroleum jelly, actually use it.
- Check everyone's gear just to make sure you don't miss that people actually have this gear bought (you forgot a stove).
- Check knife sharpness before leaving the house. Good thing you bought a sharpening stone.
- Don't let emergency blankets get wet, though they are waterproof,
- Get better emergency blankets: SOL or NDUR.
- Bring extra Ziplock bags, for trash, or for when you need separate waterproofing (these things condense).
- Put bus clothes in their own Ziplock bag so they won't take up all the space in the dry bag.
- Just get a rubber mat since your "earth pad" sucks in terms of waterproofing.
- Bent pole: Needs a splint to reconnect it, you can't just use duct tape (esp. since duct tape sucks when it's wet).
- Tent pitching: The rainfly must be separated from the body. Double check this by going inside the tent and checking that it is separated, and that the fabric sew lines are aligned.
- Tent pitching: Figure out how bathtub construction works. When pitched correctly, the tent body's sides will lift up, protecting the center portion from water.
- Tent pitching: Ground sheets must be smaller than the tent. Cut the ground sheet if you have to.
- Tent pitching: You only guy out the side of the tent where the wind will heat.
- Tempo shelter leaks. Figure out where the leak is.
- Don't get crappy trekking poles. Their locking mechanisms usually suck.
- Body heat is imbalanced. Don't be afraid to footsie someone for the sake of body heat.
- People have their own pace and as a GL you have to let them go at their own pace.
- Dogs will go into flysheets to get food.
- While you were disciplined in keeping the fleece/thermal pants dry, the inner lining of your jacket got wet, rendering it useless.
- In case the tent floor gets wet, you need a way to remove the water. While it was good that you had a cotton shirt, you could have had a more absorbent material.
- Bring contact lens solution in an ultralight container. Your solution spilled.
- After the first day, a 3 day 2 night hike is just like a normal overnight climb, so compensate with your water accordingly.
- GL is responsible for all group members. Make decisions for people who are cold, tired, and can't think clearly.
- Ensure that iPod touch is on Airplane mode.
- The Lenovo phone batter actually lasts a long time.
- DO NOT EVER URINATE NEAR A FREAKING WATER SOURCE, even if it was a lapse of judgment.
- When whistling for a rest stop, be decisive. Where you whistle is when you will stop.
- You are a UPM member now, and everything you do will be judged accordingly. Keep your physical fitness and skills sharp.

## Random talk

- A lot of SAR operations deal with subjects out on dayhikes. If you're in full backpacking mode you probably have a ton of gear and can handle getting twisted up a bit. Day hikers generally don't have a way to stay warm and dry as the elements shift.
- People with decent wilderness experience tend to walk far and long when lost.
- The more lost you get trying to find your way out, the harder it is for SAR to find you. Just leave an itinerary with an exact route with a family member or friend and tell them that if something seems wrong, to contact the police.

## Balingkilat: August 15-16 2015

- Cooked: Chicken BBQ, Java rice, Grilled Hotdog, Onion omelette.
- Climbing is really really fun if you go with your UPM batchmates.
- Hotdog takes a long time to grill.
- Onion takes a long time to grill and what you made sucked.
- No need to preheat the pan if it is made of aluminum (it will melt).
- You need to practice doing stuff outside while it's hot.
- It's hard to refill your hydration pack when you have an earth pad in the pack as well.
- When renting a van, rent a van with space in the back for the bags.
- Always wear two layers of socks (or one thick layer) so you don't hurt your feet while walking on stones.
- Double check hygienics bag before leaving, so you don't leave important stuff at home. Even if you bought it, you might have forgotten to put it in your pack.
- Be wary of spilling hot soup over your legs.
- Double check kneepads if yours are too tight. Or maybe you don't need them anymore. :)
- Double check the logistics of putting ice in the hydration pack and covering with the windbreaker.
- Convertible pants gave way :(
- Figure out alternate tying methods of string for hammocks.
- Cut your nails, really.
- You can consider wet wipes and tissue paper as group equipment.
- Butane dissipates if you don't have the cover.
- RubyConf flipflops are around 200g lighter than your Sandugo sandals--they suck for walking but they are lighter/take up less space.
- Instead of Gatorade, just take up water with Hydrite.

## Tarak Ridge: August 8-9 2015

- Cooked: Tacos on Pita Bread, Banana Oatmeal, Chicken Salpicao
- Tarak Ridge has parking/shower facilities at the jump-off. Parking: 100, shower: 20.
- Before leaving, ensure that everyone has headlamps and enough water.
- It's a good idea to practice overnight hikes with a fully loaded pack, so you don't get surprised with the weight of the pack when you do hike fully loaded.
- Tempo shelter (lean-to) drainage, once you have the four corners up, one of the midpoints of the sides should be anchored to a lower spot so there is drainage.
- Tempo shelter taut line, do the taut line first on a loose string then just tension it later (easier to do the turns around the rope this way).
- Bring extra plastics for garbage disposal. They weigh nearly nothing and you can just bring them again to the next climb.
- It was a bad idea to bring non-trekking shorts (they were made of cotton so it doesn't dry easily).
- Marks & Spencer thermal underpants worked, problem is no pockets.
- It seems okay to not bring the malong if you have thermal underpants already. Plus, waterproof the malong!
- Don't forget a trowel, or you can just use a bolo or a can of Maling for digging.
- Be wary of your cap. It can easily get lost, especially once you're wearing your headgear.
- Put your clothes in the dry bag, and your electronics in the zip lock. Electronics = earphones, iPod, no need for Powerbank because the iPod lasta a long time especially on airplane mode.
- Turn off the Happymobile phone when you're not using it!
- The small bottles are awesome, you can season the meat while it is being cooked.
- Chop chicken/beef when frying, plus close the lid, for maximum flavor.
- It's okay to have excess garlic/onion/tomato, you can saute them and put them anywhere.
- When precooking chicken, some "latak" or small bits might float to the top, remove them, those are bad.
- It's a good idea to bring a true pan scrubber (metal) if you know there is a river.
- When adding salt or pepper to a dish, don't shake it onto the cookset, shake it onto the spoon, so even if it spills, it's not a big deal.
- Toothbrush must be accessible (top of pack not inside of top of pack).
- Eat before leaving the jump-off point, or you'll get hungry on the way home.
- Just be prepared for every FA emergency, you got burned and didn't bring ointment.
- Thinking of getting lighter sandals, but that would make the walks to/from the jump-off point harder.

## Batulao: August 1 2015

- Need a smaller trash bag so your shit doesn't spill when you just put it in a pocket. This time, pork and beans spilt.
- Bring FA even if you have a designated FA already.
- Good thing you brought a lot of painkiller.
- The Pork and Beans they sell in the market do not have a lot of calories in them. Not really good trail food.
- All boys = not that many pictures.
- Figure out a way to keep cooler during hot climbs especially in the Batangas mountains.
- If you have a sort of physically unfit member in the team, compensate accordingly. You could have brought a stove for cooking/eating lunch easily.

## Purgatory: July 25-26 2015

- Cooked: Tacos, Bacon, Rosemary/Basil Chicken
- Take Bonamine before every mountain wherein you go through a zigzag road trail.
- Everyone needs at least 30L pack, having a smaller pack will force you to make hasty decisions and possibly underpack.
- Always bring tying strings/pegs even if you may not need them because you never know when you need a tempo shelter.
- Precooking works, but bring spices so you can continue seasoning while cooking.
- When putting pots and pans over the spider stove, add an allowance for the weight of the handle.
- When transferring fluids, take care to think of which surfaces the liquid will land on if it spills (ex: THE STOVE).
- It seems like a good idea to invest in a multifuel stove (butane is hard to control).
- Everyone needs a malong, extra socks (wool), either sleeping bag or emergency blanket for the campsite.
- 2 takal of rice for 2 meals for 2 people is correct ratio.
- Get an egg holder. 60 from Brown Trekker.
- Bring multivitamins next time.
- Hiking is better with contact lens on.
- Tacos break, try getting pita bread next time for taco-style dishes. Also need more than 2 tomatoes.
- No more cooking oil, they sleep, just use olive oil.
- Small containers for food coloring can be bought at Savemore, just remove the contents. You can put olive oil inside. This can also be used for soap.
- Trekking pole on stone steps--place it in the center of the step, you tripped here.
- Possibly get a shoe bag stuff sack so your dirty shoes won't float at the outside of the pack.
- Level up in rice cooking. Try stirring the rice after it boils.
- Nips is imba trail food. 2 Nips per day per person seems to be a good ratio.
- Even on a major climb, I just consumed 1L of water the first day. (I think I also consumed 500ml Gatorade.
- Need a more compact first aid kit.
- Get a sleeping bag for lining the hammock, you will die outside if you don't.
- Good Taste in Baguio = good food value, 90 for most meals and there are group options.
- Good thing that I was able to sleep on the journey home. :)

## Talamitam/Tagaytay: July 17 2015

- Cooked: Some weird Pancit Canton dish
- Get used to sleeping in a hammock, also you have to master slip knot since all the other hitches are hard to untie with
- Early morning hikes (starting at around 4-5am) are awesome. I actually think we woke the guides up.
- Egg holder if you plan on bringing noodles when you go up
- Fire building, you can only put wet wood on the fire if you are confident that the flame is powerful enough to cause the water vapor to evaporate before burning the wood itself
- It is possible to create a tempo shelter out of cogon grass, there just has to be the right way of cording it
- #squadgoals are awesome, good way to motivate everyone to finish the climb.
- Still need to increase core/back strength, you lean forward when you climb.
- Skyway toll is around +30 to +50.
- Tagaytay Mahogany Market costs: 2 Bulalo, 1 Tawilis, 16 cups of rice, 7 soft drinks: 1325.
- Nasugbu is about 30 minutes from Tagaytay.
- Possibly add facial wash to your soap kit.
- Don't forget trekking polo and jogging pants.
- Machete grip: put lanyard on the wrist
- Ferrocerium and knife: Use the spine, not the blade
- Next time take a lot of pictures.

## Maculot: July 4 2015

- FUCK IT IS STILL HARD FOR YOU TO SLEEP BEFORE THE CLIMB.
- Get a repair kit for torn packs and torn shorts, learn how to use it.
- Packed lunch--double check itinerary to ensure that you don't buy overpriced lunches. Maculot has a lot of areas where you can cook lunch in.
- Really, really, avoid overpopulated mountains during the weekends because your itinerary will be delayed.
- Save itinerary and times on your phone or print it out, don't be lazy about this.
- Literally any place in Lipa is good for Lomi..
- First trip to Batangas on Jam Liner is 4am, next is 5am.
- Maculot can be climbed at any time, even at night.
- Last trips out of Batangas are around 8pm, some 9pm.
- Heavy traffic from Cuenca to Lipa at night.
- Just do not drink soft drinks.
- Put ice in the hydration pack as it will last for the first x hours.
- Better to just pool everyone's money and accounting after.
- Pen and paper may be needed to write stuff down.

## Random talk

- Gap between bottle and fire because the bottle cools the fire
- Pillowcase
- UV Rashguard is needed. Need to apply sunscreen every 2 hours.
- Try to get a Columbia Silver Ridge for your trekking polo top to prevent UV.
- If you're hiking uphill, lace your shoes more loosely to allow for blood flow. If going downhill, lace your shoes more tightly to keep your feet in place and not rubbing the toes of your shoes.
- Longer hikes: When resting every hour, elevate your feet for 5-10 minutes.
- Snacks: Dried fruit? :)

## Pico de Loro: June 27 2015

- It is still nearly impossible for you to sleep for an early morning trip so better to sleep before super
- Go for long-sleeved shirt rather than short-sleeved shirt + rash guard combo (you might lose the rash guard, more parts, aesthetically better in photos)
- The Mountainsmith trekking poles are not so good, they jam frequently :(
- Need a new carabiner for the Camelbak on the daypack
- Try just bringing sandwiches for trail food as opposed to buying expensive foods. Rebisco works
- Near impossible to do 2 dayhikes on Sat/Sun because of sleep deprivation. Try Fri-Sun next time.
- Fire vs mosquitoes

## Ugo: June 13-14 2015

- Bring toothpaste
- Compartmentalize kikay kit
- Your cotton socks suck
- Prioritize sun protection--get a long sleeved trekking shirt
- Reflectors on tent pegs are legit
- Improvised VSS using staff: no need to spin it to stake it down
- Don't forget you can use random branches as improvised stakes/pegs
- Do not under any circumstance use cow shit as "weight"
- Look for melon-sized rocks ASAP as possible pegs
- You can use peg to remove the other peg that is dug so deep
- Cooking rice: Full blast until boiling, then weaken a bit and let the boiling water escape
- Costing: Estimate what the true cost of the climb is
- Better to have too much trail food than too little. Jerky is okay but super expensive. Prunes are not that of much use. Tuna sandwich perhaps next time?
- Get a Smart sim card most Internet in the province is via Smart
- The fucking cord/iPod is hard to charge so get a better setup
- I think ziplocking each day of clothes is easier than putting them in a compression bag
- Lolo's windbreaker is too large and tbh not that effective
- Flash the cow in case it comes too near to your tent
- Check load lifter angle because your pack might not be fitted correctly
- Try not to drink too much soft drinks, just drink normal water
- Ugo--no need to have much water, but before going to the camp site you really need a lot
- Delirium in campsite: take a nap
- Important: Some people don't want your help, they are doing the climb to prove something to themselves, as a social person recognize it
- Don't forget extra batteries for your homies
- When splitting a tent, you have to be near the person you are splitting the tent with, so when you reach the campsite, you can pitch easily

## Tibig: June 6-7 2015

- Gain knowledge of how to cook sinigang: Meat first then tomato/onion then string beans then eggplant
- If you properly precook the meat will last for a week
- Better knowledge of how to cook rice: Whatever the height of the rice is, that should be the height of the water, and you can put plastic on the end
- Clove hitch to the pegs because you can move the pegs around. Or do a taut line on the pegs
- When you don't have a corner grommet you can put a one peso coin or small stone, and then put a clove hitch under the resulting knot
- To form the center of the VSS on a trekking pole, clove hitch a small tying string on it
- Label your cookset with some string or something
- Dont forget pandan for rice
- Blowtorch can be helpful on a marshmallow, then melt all chocolates to make "fondue"
- No black tying strings it is easy to lose
- Check tent campsite for stones/rocks so it is nicer for you to sleep
- Since the tent is freestanding clean out debris before you dismantle it
- Knick knacks as trail food is not that good since the chocolate melts

## Tagapo: June 5 2015

- Notify your contact person
- Charge phone before leaving

## Binacayan/Pamitinan: May 28 2015

- Bring a tarp at the back of the vehicle always

- Practice going on top of stones to conquer your fear of heights
- Sometimes no trail food needed if maikli lang talaga yung distance

## Pinatubo via 4x4: May 23 2015

- Do not leave trek pole in the car

## Sembrano: May 21 2015

- Navigation
- Trail sign seeing
- The ability to fashion tungkods from nowhere
- Use gatorade cover as spoon if there is no spoon

## Binacayan/Pamitinan: May 16-17 2015

- You can cover hydration with malong or insulators to still keep it cold

## Banahaw de Liliw

- Be super praning sa rain, possibly bring more waterproofing than usual
- Shorten trek poles when ascending ala vertical limit
- Refill hydration pack before start of a trek because it is hard to check
- Additional pair of clothes or at least
- Try tent peg reflector baka mawala yung pegs ulit huhu
- Be disciplined sa tent pitching
- This is where you have to be super good at knots because the tempo shelter will not be pogi if knots are bad
- Actually just be good at tempo shelter
- Earthpad, better if yung earthpad na insulator kasi di talaga nababasa yun
- Always wear hipbelt sobrang mabilis mapagod ang shoulder, better talaga if back na lang
- Crossing logs, sit if you have to, low center of gravity
- Mandatory to have gloves
- Rash guards are really for rashes.
- When climbing do not wear windbreaker or jacket. Just go with baselayer... You will produce heat anyway. Just wear your windbreaker when you are at the camp site.
- Survival blanket will save your frigging ass so DO NOT RUIN IT.
- Know where the damned trowel is at all times.

## Makiling

- Bring a lot of trail food, you can just eat them anyway. If there really is still excess trail food, then give it to mountain kids.
- Do not bring a big ass 5L. Easily accessible hydration. Proper way of hydration
- Finishing a 10K in the alloted time doesn't really mean that you can just climb randomly.
- Practice cooking at home so you can actually contribute to the cooking.
- Hydrite is your friend.
- Bring 3 shirts (one for trekking, one for the camp, and one for going home), and 2 pairs of pants (1 for trekking, 1 for camp/going home).

## Bungkol Baka

- Put the windbreaker near the top of the pack, consider it something that you need in an instant.
- Precook, not cook. If you cook the Beef Broccoli it will rot faster. Vegetables rot easily.
- Really listen to the UPM peeps when they are discussing BMC skills. You'll regret it later.
- We do not wear sandals when trekking because of the risk of ankle sprains.
