## Mountaineering The Freedom of the Hills

#### Fibers

- *Cotton.* Good in hot weather. Breathes well. Comfortable when dry. Highly absorbent; dries slowly. Loses insulating qualities when wet. Inappropriate for cool or wet conditions. Used for sun protection, bandannas, hats, and T-shirts.
- *Wool.* More abrasion and wind-resistant than many synthetics. Retains insulating qualities when wet. High friction on snow, ice. Does not melt with high heat. Heavier; absorbs more water and dries less quickly than most synthetics. Can be bulky. Used for skin layers, insulating, and outer layers.
- *Polyester or polypropylene.* Most types absorb little water. Retains insulating qualities when wet. Lightweight.  Some types retain odors. Not wind resistant. Can be bulky. Melts with high heat. Uses: Skin layers (underwear, T-shirts), insulating layers, hats, gloves, socks.
- *Nylon.* Strong, durable, lightweight. Good wind and abrasion resistance. Dries slowly, slippery, melts with high heat. Uses: Outer layers, rain pants, hats, vapor-barrier socks.
- *Stretch or woven nylon blend.* Some types dry slowly. May snag. May be expensive. Skin layers, light outer or mid-layer (pants, shirts).

#### Insulating Fills

- *Down.* Warmest, lightest, most luxurious insulating fill available. Packs small yet regains loft/warmth when unpacked. Problem: It loses its insulating value when wet, and is almost impossible to dry in damp conditions.
- *Synthetic fill.* Do not collapse when wet. Less expensive and more easily cleaned. (Not as many compression cycles.)
