## Saving Your Knees While Hiking Downhill
[Reference](http://blog.outdoorherbivore.com/life/saving-knees-hiking-downhill/)

- The knees bear the most weight of your body. 3-6 times your body weight is exerted on your knee with each level step you take. Lower your weight.
- Don't hike knee-locked during a steep decline. Traverse zigzag, sideways, or s-shaped by making your own mini-switchbacks. Try to dump supplies before heading downhill to make things easier.
- The knee joint is mobile but low stability. Take care and protect your knees over your lifetime so they can serve you for an entire lifetime.
- Soft soil vs concrete surfaces, feet vs pavement means your knees absorb the maximum rebound.
- Cushioned/proper fitting shoes. Your hiking shoes must be tied tightly so they fit snug around your feet.
- Knee brace to offer additional support when hiking. Open patella to prevent join compression.
- Hiking pole redistributes weight to the arms and shoulders.
- Foods:
  - Omega-3 foods such as walnuts/olive oil.
  - Dried pineapple: bromelain (pineapple) is a natural anti-inflammatory.
  - Glucosamine/chondroitin, substances that can reduce pain and rebuild cartilage.
- Daily stretching.
- Strong leg muscles with weight training.

## Knee pain when descending a mountain
[Reference](https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6610/knee-pain-when-descending-a-mountain)

- Don't hike knee-locked.
- Don't jump or take long strides, it kills the knee.
- You can pre-dose with ibuprofens.
- Descending: put your weight on the back foot for as long as you can while moving the front foot forward. Then when the foot touches the ground, shift your weight on it. The above force won't be absorbed by the skeletal structure, but by the muscles.
