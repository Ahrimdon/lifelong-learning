## Tents for Camping: How to Choose

- Capacity: When evaluating, assume a close fit. Upsize if you are large, claustrophobic, toss and turn at night, sleep better with more elbow room, and are bringing a dob.

#### Tent features

- Peak height. Cabin-style tents have near vertical walls, dome-style tents offer superior strength and wind-shedding abilities.
- Tent floor length.
- Tent doors (how many).
- Tent poles. Virtually all family tents these days are freestanding. Fewer poles allow faster setups. Aluminum poles are stronger and more durable than fiberglass.
- Rainfly.

## Tent Care

#### Tent Care in the Field

- Look for an established campsite on a smooth level surface with no vegetation. Clear debris that can jab the tent floor.
- Use a footprint--this discourages rain water from collecting under the tent floor. Tuck excess material under the tent floor.
- Some wetness may be the result of condensation (this occurs when the ground and footprint are cold and the tent floor is slightly warmer. You can't prevent this, so just dry out wet items before long-term storage.
- Leave boots or camp footwear outside the or in the vestibule.
- The sun's UV rays cause nylon to degrade. If your campsite offers little or no shade, cover your tent with its rain fly.
- If your tent is freestanding, pick it up and shake out debris in the morning before you pack it away.
- If you forget your stakes, use big rocks to serve as stakes. Place a second rock on top of the cord to push the cord to ground level and adds weight and friction for security.
- Do not whip the poles around to cause the sections to "snap" together. This can chip the fittings and weaken the poles. Better to fit the sections together one at a time by hand.
- When disassembling a tent, first separate a shockcorded pole in the middle rather than starting at the end of the pole.
- When packing a tent, avoid folding the tent or rainfly fabric on the same crease lines (the creases can become permanent and grow brittle).

#### Tent Care at Home

- Set up the tent first at home.
- Make sure a tent is dry before storing it. *Wet tents invite mildew.*
- To clean a tent, use a non-abrasive sponge, cold water, and a non-detergent soap. Gently scrub soiled areas by hand. Avoid household cleaners (these are perfumed and will attract bugs, mice, and other critters).
- Do not machine-wash a tent.
