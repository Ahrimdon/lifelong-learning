## Mountaineering The Freedom of the Hills Food

- Energy expenditure on a climb can go as high as 6000 calories per day, possibly even higher for larger folks. In comparison, most people require only about 1500 to 2500 calories per day when living a sedentary life.
- Never engage in dieting during a mountaineering trip.
- Carbohydrates: The easiest food for the body to convert into energy. Sugar can be supplied not only by honey or sugar but also by fruits, jam, hot cocoa, sport gels, and drink mixes.
- Proteins: The daily requirement is nearly constant regardless of type or level of activity. *The body cannot store proteins, so once the protein requirement is met, the excess is either converted to energy or stored as fat.*
- Fats: Because fats pack more than twice as many calories per gram as proteins/carbohydrates, they are an important energy source. Fats are digested more slowly than carbohydrates or proteins, so they help keep you satisfied longer. Fats occur naturally in small amounts in vegetables/grains/beans.
- Many people find that foods high in fat are more difficult to digest during strenuous exercise. Eat mainly carbohydrates during the day and replenish calorie stores by adding fats and proteins to the evening meal. Cold-weather mountaineers stay warmer at night if they have a bedtime snack high in slower-burning food fuel.
- Food planning: 2 pounds of food per person per day.
- Use firm bread, rolls, or bagels for sandwich so it won't get squished. Leave out mayonnaise and other ingredients that spoil readily.
- High altitude: Water boils at lower temperatures, and cooking takes longer at higher altitudes. *For every decrease of 5 degrees Celsius in boiling temperature, cooking time doubles.*
- Mountain sickness: Sometimes, food becomes more difficult to digest because the stomach and lungs are competing for the same blood supply. Climbers must continue to eat and drink because the loss of energy from a lack of food or water will only reinforce the debilitating effects of reduced oxygen.
- Breakfast: Oatmeal, bakery items, instant cocoa/coffee/milk, hash browns, omelets, scrambled eggs, bacon bits.
- Lunch: GORP during the trail, or mix a flavored beverage such as lemonade or fruit punch.
- Dinner: Soup + pasta/rice/beans/potatoes. Margarine keeps better than butter on long trips.
