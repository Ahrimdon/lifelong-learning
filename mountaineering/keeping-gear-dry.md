## Keeping Your Critical Gear Dry

- Possible to get wet not by snow, but by walking through wet vegetation, river crossing.
- Concern over lightweight hiking as this has prompted manufacturers to overstate the capabilities of their ultralight waterproof product offerings.
- *Pack covers.* It can keep a pack from absorbing a lot of water, but that's about the extend of its value. Do not depend on a pack cover alone to keep critical items dry. Covers can't protect gear from submersion, or from perspiration that can soak through the back of a pack. In camp, they can't protect items that have been removed from the pack.
- *Ponchos.* Similar to backpack covers.
- *Waterproof packs.* "Silnylon"'s water resistance is very limited, especially when subjected to the stresses of gear stuffing. This water resistance also deteriorates significantly with use.
- *Pack liner.* The problem with trash compactor bags is that they don't hold up very well on extended trips. Punctures from sharp objects, as well as the wear that results from the movement of its contents against the walls of the liners, tend to produce leaks fairly quickly.
- *Gear sacks.* Best IMO.

#### Gear Sack Criteria

- *Fabric.* Must be waterproof enough to provide an adequate level of protection for its contents. Sleeping bags and insulated clothing are usually the most important survival items to keep dry, but cameras/electronics/maps also need the same level of protection. Utility/first aid/personal/kitchen need less protection. Stuffing a sleeping bag into a gear sack can put a fair amount of stress on the fabric--both on its sides and on its bottom.
- *Seam construction.* Either sewn, glued, or welded, but they need to be at least as strong as the fabric itself.
- *Closure mechanism.* Should allow easy access to gear even when wearing gloves or mittens. Draw-string closure is useless for sealing water. Better to twist then fold over.
- Roll tops are probably the best approach for dry sack closures.

#### Perspiration and Humidity

- When hiking in cold weather, don't overdress. If you're perspiring heavily into a jacket, take it off and replace it with a lighter piece if possible. Damp clothing should be stored in such a way that it doesn't get even wetter.
- A down sleeping bag can absorb up to a pint of moisture during a single night, so it's important to air your sleeping bag every morning if possible. If the bag is opened so that the inside is exposed to the maximum airflow, much of the accumulated moisture will evaporate fairly quickly, even under chilly or cloudy conditions.
- High humidity levels can sometimes induce insulated gear to absorb moisture, though rarely with notable consequences. While affected gear might feel clammy, even down garments and sleeping bags usually won't lose a substantial amount of loft from humidity absorption alone.
