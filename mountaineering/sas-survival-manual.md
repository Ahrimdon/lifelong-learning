## SAS Survival Manual

- Think of survival skills as a pyramid, built on the foundation of the will to survive. The next pyramid is knowledge. The third layer is training: mastering skills and maintaining them. To cap the pyramid, add your kit. Combine the instinct for survival with knowledge, training, and kit and you will be ready for anything.

- Be prepared: How long will I be away? How much food and water do I need to carry? Have I the right clothing/footwear for the climb? Should I take standbys? What special equipment do I need for the terrain? What medical kit is appropriate?

#### Survival Kit

- Matches. Preferably waterproof, but non-safety matches can be 'sower proofed' by dipping heads in melted candle fat. Snap off half to save space.
- Candle. Shave square for packing.
- Flint. Processed flint with saw striker.
- Magnifying glass. To start fire in sunlight.
- Needles and thread. Several needles, including at least one with a very large eye to take sinew and coarse thread.
- Fish hooks and line. Selection of hooks and split lead weights, plus as much line as possible.
- Compass. Liquid-filled type with luminous button is best. Make sure it is in working order and you know how to use it.
- Beta light. A light-emitting crystal for map-reading at night and as fishing lure.
- Snare wire. Preferably brass. 60-90 cm.
- Flexible saw. Remove handles and grease before storing.
- Medical kit. Pack medicines in airtight controllers with cotton wool. Label carefully with full dosage instructions and expiry date. Do not exceed recommended dosages or take with alcohol.
  - Analgesic: Pain reliever for mild/moderate pain.
  - Intestinal sedative: For acute/chronic diarrhea.
  - Antihistamine: For allergies, insect bites/stings.
  - Water sterilizing tablets: When you cannot boil suspect water.
  - Anti-malaria tablets.
  - Potassium permanganate: Add to water and mix until pink to sterilize, deeper pink to make antiseptic, full red to treat fungal diseases.
  - Surgical blades: At least 2 scalpel blades of different sizes.
  - Butterfly sutures: to hold edges of wounds together.
  - Plasters.
- Condom.

#### Survival Pouch

- Pouch. Must be waterproof, large enough to take a mess tin, with a positive fastening that will not come undone and a strong loop to hold it on your belt.
- Fuel. Solid fuel tablets in their own stove container.
- Signal flares. To attract attention.
- Mess tin. Aluminum cooking utensil.
- Pencil-sized torch. Keep long-lasting batteries reversed inside so they won't run down if accidentally switched on.
- Marker panel (fluorescent strip for signaling).
- Matches.
- Brew kit.
- Food. Tube of butter, dehydrated meat, chocolate, salt tablets or electrolite powder which contains vitamins, salt, and other minerals.
- Survival bag. Heat-insulated bag of reflective material that keeps you warm and free of condensation.

### Knives

- A multi-bladed penknife is useful, but if you can carry only one knife, take something stronger, a general-purpose blade that will do all likely tasks efficiently and comfortably, from cutting trees to skinning animals and preparing food.
- Folding knives: Should have a good locked position. A wooden handle is more comfortable to use.
- Parang/bolo/machete. Too large for everyday use, it is ideal in the wilds for cutting down trees and building shelters and rafts.
- Sharpening: sandstone, quartz, and granite will sharpen tools. Rub two pieces together to make them smooth. A double-faced stone with a rough and smooth surface is ideal. Use the rough surface first to remove burrs, then the smooth one to get a fine edge.

#### Water

- An adult can survive for three weeks without food but only three days without water.
- The human body loses 2-3 liters of water each day. Loss of liquids through respiration and perspiration increases with work rate and temperature. Vomiting and diarrhea increase loss further. This must be replaced either by actual water or water contained in food.

- To keep fluid loss to the minimum:
  - Avoid exertion. Just rest. Don't smoke.
  - Keep cool. Stay in shade. If there is none, erect a cover to provide it.
  - Do not lie on hot ground or heated surfaces.
  - Don't eat, eat as little as possible--digestion uses up liquids, increasing dehydration. Fat is especially hard to digest.
  - Never drink alcohol. This takes fluid from vital organs to break it down.
  - Don't talk. Breathe through the nose, not the mouth.

- Finding Water:
  - Dig in gullies and dry stream beds.
  - In mountains, look for water trapped in crevices.
  - On the coast, dig above the high water line, or look for lush vegetation in faults in cliffs: you might find a spring.

- Animals as Signs of Water:
  - Mammals: Grazing animals are usually never far from water as they need to drink at dawn and dusk. Converging game trails often lead to water; follow them downhill. Meat eaters are not good indicators--they get moisture from their prey.
  - Birds: Grain eaters (finches and pigeons) are never far from water and drink at dawn and dusk. When they fly straight and low, they are heading for water. When returning from water, they fly from tree to tree, resting frequently. Water birds and birds of prey do not drink frequently and are therefore not good indicators.
  - Insects: Bees are good indicators. Ants are dependent on water. A column of ants marching up a tree is going to a small reservoir of trapped water. Such reservoirs are found even in arid areas. Most flies keep within 90 meters of water.
  - Reptiles: They collect what little moisture they need from their prey. Not good indicators.
  - Humans: Tracks usually lead to a well, bore hole or soak.

- Condensation: Trees can draw moisture from a water table 15 meters or more below ground. Let the tree pump it up for you by tying a plastic bag around a healthy, leafy branch or placing a polythene tent over vegetation. *Evaporation from the leaves will produce condensation in the bag.*
- Solar still.
- Distillation: Pass a tube into the top of a water-filled covered container, placed over a fire, and the other end into a sealed collecting tin which should be set inside another container providing a jacket of cold water to cool the vapor as it passes out of the tube. Or, you can take a tube from a covered vessel in which polluted or salt water is to boil. Set the other end under a solar still. A sheet of metal, bark, or leaf weighted down will cover the vessel and help direct the steam into the tube.
