## Home Cures and Popular Beliefs

*The healing power of belief can be very strong.* Many home remedies work in this way. They help largely because people have faith in them. For this reason, they are especially useful to cure illnesses that are partly in people's minds, or those caused in part by a person's beliefs, worry, or fears.

For all of these problems, the manner or 'touch' of the healer can be very important. What it often comes down to is showing you care, helping the sick person believe he will get well, or simply helping him relax.

The power of belief can help heal people. But it can also harm them. If a person believes strongly enough that something will hurt him, his own fear can make him sick.  Once I was called to see a woman who had just had a miscarriage and was still bleeding a little. There was an orange tree near her house. So I suggested she drink a glass of orange juice. (Oranges have vitamin C which helps strengthen blood vessels.) She drank it—even though she was afraid it would harm her.  Her fear was so great that soon she became very ill. I examined her, but could find nothing physically wrong.  I tried to comfort her, telling her she was not in danger. But she said she was going to die. At last I gave her an injection of distilled (completely pure) water. Distilled water has no medical effect. *But since she had great faith in injections, she quickly got better.*

*Actually, the juice did not harm her. What harmed her was her belief that it would make her sick. And what made her well was her faith in injections!*

By understanding the truth about the orange, the injection, and the tricks of her own mind, perhaps this woman and her family will become freer from fear and better able to care for their health in the future. For health is closely related to understanding and freedom from fear.
