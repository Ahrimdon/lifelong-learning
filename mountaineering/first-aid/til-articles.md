## Heat or Cold Compress
[Reference](https://www.marshfieldclinic.org/sports-wrap/ice-or-heat)

- Acute injury: occurred within the last 48 hours. Could be because of trauma. Ice, to reduce swelling and control pain.
- Chronic injuries: they develop slowly, because a body part is being overused or because an acute injury has healed improperly. Heat to increase circulation/joint pain. You can apply the heat before exercise to increase flexibility and stimulate blood flow to the area.
- After exercise, ice is the best choice because it discourages the onset of swelling and pain.

## Eliminate Leg Cramps While Hiking
[Reference](http://blog.outdoorherbivore.com/life/eliminate-leg-cramps-while-hiking/)

- Overusing the muscles, inadequate eccentric contraction strength, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance from sweating, and insufficient carbohydrate intake.
- Concentric muscle contraction (shortening when tense) and eccentric muscle contraction (lengthening under tension, when you are going downhill you try to reduce your speed).
- Research shows that most leg cramps, soreness, injury, are from eccentric contraction (downhill). Most of our daily activity does not involve enough eccentric motion. Ex, treadmills have an incline setting, but no decline setting. So you need to train these muscles.
- Dehydration: when the body becomes dehydrated, the your nerve endings flatten, hyper excite, and discharge, which feels like a muscle spasm.
- Electrolyte imbalance: add salt to your water. Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium.
- Inadequate carbs? Depleted glycogen, leading to muscle cramps.
