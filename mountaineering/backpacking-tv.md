- Bringing rain gear is a must! It loses it water repelling over time.
- No cotton, when it gets wet, it takes a long time to dry. It will also make you colder because it will sap heat from your body.
- Quick-drying synthetic shirts and underwear. For natural materials, wool.
- Feet: Wool or synthetic socks, not cotton. Try waterproofing your socks.
- Rain cover + dry bags for sleeping bag and extra clothes.
- Dig trenches on the high side of your tent.
- When using a ground sheet, make sure it doesn't extend beyond your tent since it will catch the rain.
