## 30 Things you should have in your Medical First Aid Kits
[link](http://offgridsurvival.com/30-things-you-should-have-in-your-medical-kits/)

- *A way to stop bleeding and close wounds.* Duct tape, butterfly sutures. When using duct tape or butterfly sutures, carefully clean the wound and wash out any foreign materials or debris. If you have antiseptic, apply it to the wound and dry the area. Start in the middle of the wound and apply strips to close the edges. Work your way towards the edges, gently bringing the two sides together and taping them shut.
- *Ways to prevent infection.* During a survival situation, where sanitation issues may become a problem, keeping your wounds clean and covered is extremely important. Infection can set in quickly, so you need to stop on top of any open wounds.
