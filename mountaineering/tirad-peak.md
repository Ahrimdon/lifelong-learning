## Tirad Peak
- Major jumpoff: Poblacion, Gregorio del Pilar
- LLA: 1388 MASL
- 5/9, Trail class 1-4, Historical trail

- Campsite can accomodate a large group
- Early morning assault to summit, 4-5 hours to reach Peak on light packs. You will follow the route the Americans used to catch the Philippine Army.

- Rocky trail, bouldering needed to reach peak
- Steep, 150 meter assault
- Summit is barely enough for five persons
- Parts of trail covered with bamboo trees/foliage so dense that the setting sun is not enough to shed light on it
- Water source 2km from jumpoff, water source in the shrine
- once a day lang silang bumiyahe back to candon city P80 each person...morning po sila bumibyahe around 7am-8am. kasi if mag-rerent talaga kyo ng jeep aabutin ang fare ng P1500-P1800.ganun din po pabalik P80 pesos each..

- To Tirad Pass monument marker (Gen GDP seated on his horse monument): 1.5 hours to 3 hours. Open trail, similar to Makiling National park.
- 1 hour after starting, you will see papag and hut which signifies you are halfway to the monument.
- Cave after.

- Marker to summit: 2.5 hours to 4 hours.
- 10 minutes, you pass through pine trees.
- Class 1-2 from jump-off to market, 3 on upper portion of forest to small grass, going to summit class 4.
- Better to climb during summer when river is not yet high.
- For hikers doing 2D/1N climb, chartering a jeep is a must.
- Candon to GDP departs at 1pm.
- GDP to Candon departs at 7am.
- Possible to not bring tent during summer because there are open cottages below the monument and hut near the comfort room where you can take a shower.
