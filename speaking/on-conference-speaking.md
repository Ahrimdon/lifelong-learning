## On Conference Speaking
[Reference](https://hynek.me/articles/speaking/)

- The secret: an irrational fear of embarrassment and a vicious grind spanning multiple months.
- If you see a great talk, it most likely means they put endless hours into preparations.

### Phase 1: Idea.

- Over a year, I run into at least one topic I know something about that appears to be interesting to the wider public.
- In the final stretch of the (5 week) trip, people started wondering how I could be that long away from work and whether I'm ever gonna work again.
- That's when I knew it would be a popular topic to talk about.
- Since I've been doing this professionally for more than a decade, experiences and wisdom tend to pile up in the subconscious mind.
- The requirement of ordering your thoughts and spelling them out is a very useful side effect of giving talks on topics that seem obvious to you.

### Phase 2: Call for Proposals.

- Mind map to order my thoughts. Need: mobile companion app to work on the go or on the couch using the phone.
- Need to come up with a good pitch that speaks to as many people as possible.
- Submitted it after I've let multiple friends proof-read it.

### Phase 3: Waiting for the CFP Result

- No starting on the talk until I have a confirmation. Passive research: If I see something relevant, I add it to my mind map.
- At this point the mind map has just a lot of unordered root nodes.
- Just throw everything that looks interesting

### Phase 4: The Road to an Outline

- At this point, I know what I want to say, but I don't know how to say it, yet.
- Second critical point: *I have to come up with a compelling story using the material I've collected.*
- Molding a heap of information into a coherent outline is one of the hardest big-picture tasks.
- I do not subscribe though to the notion that you have to write out your talk first.
- It is difficult to write prose that works as well as talk.
- Too verbose notes will seduce you to read much more from the script.

### Phase 5: Slides

- Use few, big words. Don't make people read your slides unless it's code samples. Otherwise, they'll be distracted from what you say.
- Up to 3 bullet points (5 possible but not recommended). *You're there to explain concepts and inspire, not to read your laundry list.*
- Dark on light.
- Important stuff on the top.
- Don't rely on colors (color vision deficiencies).
- Slides support the work, not carry it.
- Slides give context, not content.
- OmniGraffle for diagrams.
- Unsplash for photos.
- Icon packages from Symbolicons.
- Final slide; Short link to the talk page with material, Twitter handle, a link to the employer.

### Speaker Notes

- Talk through a set structure. Nowadays, my notes are nothing more than just a list of bullet points and catchphrases.
- The blackout is not an issue at all as long as you have comprehensive speaker notes. You may blank over words but that can happen to anyone at any time.

### Phase 6: Polishing

- Practice out loud.
- Take notes while practicing.
- Fix slides/notes.
- Repeat.
- Only by practicing again and again you'll notice rough spots, weak transitions, and redundancies. Each iteration makes the talk a bit better both with the slides and my ability to present it.
- This is when I prepare the talk page with all the material I talk about, including continuative topics.

### Phase 7: Sneak Preview

### Phase 8: Refinement and More Polishing

- If you have a good talk ready early, your mind keeps working on it and you'll keep having insights and ideas. Watching a movie, blog posts, walking in the park, these are inspirations on how to improve the talk and make it even better.

### Phase 9: Travel

- Presentation remote.
- Display adapters with my email there.
- Presentation on a USB key.
- Proper clothes: light shirts without any patterns.
- Immunity boosters.
- One day buffer to account for jet lag.

### Phase 10: Showtime

- I get nervous, and my hands start shaking like anyone else's, but I accept and enjoy it which makes the symptoms taper off.
- Get up early, do a quick workout, pick clothes, shave, brush/floss, shower, do my hair.
- The close my talk comes, the more I isolate myself, the less caffeine I consume, and the less I drink (full bladder is bad).
- No Q&As: It's okay to do this in the hallway, not in the public where I have no time to think my answers through.

### Conclusion

- It's okay to make mistakes, no one cares. You can start over a sentence if you need to.
- Speaking to 500 well-meaning people is easier than speaking to 5 that might be antagonistic.
- Choose the proper conference.
