# Crafting a Conference Talk

*Wait for an idea.* If I don't have something worth getting excited about, I don't want to waste an audience's time talking about it. To see if the talk is worth it, I imagine the size of a typical conference audience, multiply it by $200/hour and ask myself if the talk will provide value to overcome $20,000 in lost economic activity.

Finally, I pitch the idea to my friends. If I can't get my close colleagues excited about expounding on a topic, then I'm probably not going to be able to convince strangers to give me a spot in their lineup.

*Prepare to prepare.* I struggle to fill more than 3 hours per day with good ideas when developing a talk. Most of my planning is an exercise in service of these two objectives: To persuade the audience that the thing I'm excited about is worth giving a try, and to convey the requisite information they'll need to get started on the right foot.

*Arrive at a rhetorical structure.* If a talk's title is "Top 10 Angular Tips", then it is probably better to have a rapid-fire series of "problem-solution" couplets. If creative, then use storytelling. If personal experiences, do "three simple stories". Anecdotes will do the heavy lifting.

Introductory talks have different challenges. Speaker must convince the audience that it has a problem in need of a solution. Next, convey all persuasive aspects of the solution,but leave the audience to traverse it on their own.

Better to not write content straight into Keynote. Once text is in Keynote, I tend to distract myself trying to condense and tweak it.

*Search for visual metaphors.* Audience needs a visual anchor for understanding the context of what they're looking at.

*Set up the presentation.* Keynote, 4:3 because conference projectors. Apple color palette. Code: No color, just bold what needs to get bold.

*Embed screencasts instead of live coding.* Rather than expend thirty seconds in context switching between my code and my slide deck, I use Screenflow to record/edit screencasts.

*Use a remote.* I use a Logitech R400 presenter, bring extra AAA batteries.
