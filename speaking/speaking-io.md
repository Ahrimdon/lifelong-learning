- Abstract: keep it abstract. I try not to include too many specific details to give me some leeway.
- Repetition: virtually every single Steve Jobs keynote finished with a recap.
- Most talks are best served if you can deliver them in three sections.
- Most speakers have: done this particular something a lot, and they want to talk about it.
- Talks are entertainment. Dry, academic knowledge transfer can be more easily done with blog posts, tweets, or emails. Oral = storytelling tradition that humans have been using for thousands of years.
- Do not talk about things, talk about experiences.
- Recording yourself: QuickTime.
- Practicing: A "finished" slide deck only happens if you go through the talk two or three times. Probably better to do it more, like five or seven. I'm constantly talking to myself about the talk over the week or so that I'm building it.
- Voice: How they sound. Pace, pitch, volume.
- The room isn't your audience. I sometimes do a screen recording of my talks using QuickTime.
- Presenter display: Show your slide, next slide, timer, notes, anything else.
- Be excited about your talk.
- After: share your talk online. Post your slides, post your talk, expand on your talk.
- Improving on your talk: what are people asking you about?
