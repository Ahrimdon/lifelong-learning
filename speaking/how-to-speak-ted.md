# How to speak so that people want to listen

Bad habits:

1. Gossip. Speaking ill of someone who is not present.
2. Judging. It's hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged.
3. Negativity.
4. Complaining.
5. Excuses. Don't pass stuff to everybody else. Take responsibility for your actions.
6. Exaggeration. We don't want lying.
7. Dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind.

Four cornerstones to make our speech powerful

1. Honesty.
2. Authenticity.
3. Integrity. Actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust.
4. Love. Wishing people well. *Tempered with love, honesty is a great thing. If you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time.*

Register: you can locate your voice. It's different to talk in the nose and to talk in the throat. If you want weight, you need to go down to the chest. *We vote for politicians with lower voices, because we associate depth with power and authority.* Timbre: We prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm. You can train. There are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice.
