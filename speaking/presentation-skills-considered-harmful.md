# Presentation Skills Considered Harmful
[link](http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/10/4/presentation-skills-considered-harmful)

Nothing cuts stage fright like focusing on the million ways you're doing it wrong. *If you have severe stage fright, the worse way to improve your presentation is to focus on your presentation skills.*

Presentation skills are all about YOU. What YOU do. What YOU say. How YOU say it. Stage fright is all about YOU. What they think about YOU. What they tweet about YOU. What they tell everyone in the professional community about YOU. The Big Problem is... YOU.

*The problem is thinking that what matters in your presentation is you. Unless you're a paid performer, you are not the reason they came to the conference. People sit in your session because of themselves. They are there for their own experiences, and watching you present is not one of those experiences.*

If the presentation is a user experience, then you are just a UI.

A good UI disappears and doesn't draw attention to itself. Your job is to provide a context in which something happens for them.

When you design for a user experience, you quit focusing on your skills and start focusing on their skills. Can you give them a more powerful perspective? Can you give them a new idea with immediate implementation steps? Can you give them a clear way to explain something to others that they've been feeling but could not articulate?

What matters most is that the presentation is an enabler for something bigger. *What happens after and as a result of the user experience? It is always about the post-UX-UX. Otherwise, we have wasted their precious time and cognitive resources.*

## Open with a question they would very much like an answer for.

Pose a question. You don't have to announce that you're going to answer it. If you're looking for an opening phrase, try *"Imagine you want to..."* and then go. And whatever you do, do NOT try to "establish your credibility".

When I give a presentation, nobody is allowed to introduce me. If they insist, it must only be your name. And I do not introduce myself. In that way, you go to the podium as a UI rather than The Presenter.
