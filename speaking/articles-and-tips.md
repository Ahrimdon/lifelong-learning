- Speak slowly.
- Try to just have an outline of what you want to say and wing the rest. Keep on rehearsing.
- If you're speaking to inform, research and understand your topic.
- Water.
- Think that you're just speaking to one person. If it makes sense to that one person, it probably makes sense.
- Toastmasters.
- Practice and fake your confidence.
- End your sentences.
- Focus on four people in the crowd and only make eye contact with them or around their area. It makes it easier if you treat it like a one on one conversation, then switch the person.
- Once you have the speech written, the best thing you can do is practice. This gives you an idea of the pacing and allows you to edit your speech if you fall short or run long. Practicing is the single most important thing after you've written your speech.
- Repeating a phrase: oral tradition/children's stories did this.
- Speak slowly and allow there to be pauses.

- Storytelling:
  - Start with the end with mind. "Imagine if we start in a meeting, and everyone is just hanging on your every word."
  - The spirit of giving, if it's like a sale, then people are off-put. People are more receptive if it's a giving spirit.
  - No: not to start with credentials and to start with fact. Capture their attention with an "Imagine if". Set up or start with a sort of story.
  - Show the image.
  - Understanding: understanding the people who will buy the car.
- Story does the heavy lifting.
