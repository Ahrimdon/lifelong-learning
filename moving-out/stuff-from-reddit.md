## FAQ

- College degree
- Organized programs if you don't have ties in another country yet. (Working Holiday, JET, WOOF, Fulbright, exchange)
- Do NOT mess around with laws, visas, taxes, etc. Don't try to game the system.
- Keep a US address, bank account, and drivers license if at all possible, because it really comes in handy sometimes, and they are very hard to get back once you let them go if you're not physically there.
- Don't be attached to your stuff! Multiple times in my life I have sold everything until my life fit in a suitcase (or even just a backpack) and it is the most freeing feeling.

## [How to Experience Living in a Foreign Country](http://brokenluggage.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/how-to-experience-living-in-a-foreign-country-without-getting-citizenship/)

You can live in a foreign country for 1-3 years pretty easily. All you have to do is get a working holiday visa.  If you can move from one city to another city in your home country you’d be surprised how capable you are of moving to a city in another country. The general public just doesn’t seem to grasp how realistic an option working temporarily in another country is.

Step 0: Get a passport 

Step 1: Fill out and submit the paperwork to get a working holiday visa. 

Step 2: Buy a plane ticket. 

4. Get a place to stay. Tell the taxi driver to take you to the 3rd cheapest hostel in town. 

5. Get a job. If you stay at a hostel you might find fliers for people looking for backpackers to do seasonal work.

$120 for the visa.
$200 for the medical physical
$300 for backpack and travel gear
$1000 for a plane ticket
$400 per month rent
$100 per week for food
$300 for things you’re going to ignorantly pay too much for before you learn the ropes in the new city you’re in
$100 per week for having fun

Get a big box to hold paper copies of everything, and start filling it:

- Paystubs (all of them - this is the most important thing to track)
- Tax returns (you should have them anyway, but still)
- Monthly bank statements (show actual average balance over time, not just a snapshot of when you're applying)
- Utility bills (clear proof of address)
- Silly little award certificates and training-fulfillment acknowledgements










Go scope out the place before you commit. Smell around your neighbors doors. Smelly neighbors are easy to find.

Talking from experience....be ready to be poor. Save your money as best as you can but know that a bowl of cereal can be a meal for more than just breakfast. Get a job, find a place to live and keep your chin up.
