## [Independent Redditors, what is the best tip you could give to someone who is about to move out on their own for the first time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1u2cfg/independent_redditors_what_is_the_best_tip_you/)

#### When deciding to buy nonessentials, if you can't afford to buy it twice, you can't afford it.

Do a budget and live by it. Seriously. Will save you a lot of heartache. And put a little into savings each paycheck for emergencies.

#### Buy a toilet plunger.

If you ever have to use the plunger, always keep your mouth closed and your eyes half shut. Don't.... don't ask how I know this. The first time I had a plugged toilet, I became frustrated at the progress I was making. Through gritted teeth, I gave a downward plunge and the water kinda farted up the sides of the bowl and into my mouth. The worst part though was that in my surprise, I kinda gasped and choked on a bit of it.

Take a plastic trash bag, cut a hole in the center and insert the plunger handle through it as if the bag was a dress covering the plunger itself. Whilst plunging keep the seat down to hold the bag over the bowl. You won't have that problem again.

How about "solids don't go in the sink"? 10 years on my own, not one clogged sink.

#### Learn how to cook.

My advice for bachelors is to buy a cheap rice cooker and a big bag of rice. When I'm really broke I alternate between rice & canned beans (or chili) and fried rice (add frozen mixed veggies and an egg).

I would actually recommend a nice rice cooker if you eat it somewhat regularly. I've found that a good cooker results in better rice, is easier to clean, and can be used for a variety of foods. Besides, when you're eating rice 4+ days a week like I do, you're saving enough money to splurge on a quality cooker.

Keto isn't exactly healthy... It's designed to make you look good, not feel good.

#### Actually make a conscious effort to clean up your trash. You probably don't notice as much when you have someone to clean up after you, but those empty soda bottles and Domino's boxes pile up quick without you noticing. And everyone will totally judge you for it.

And stay on top of the dirty dishes. This is my bane.

Dishes! A good habit I've picked up is washing dishes you've used while whatever meal you're making is cooking. Also, if dishes do pile up in the sink, make sure they're soaked so when you do get around to washing them, you don't have to work so hard. I've found that when I've got a lot of dishes, it's faster for me to soap and sponge them all first, putting them on the counter space next to the sink (if there's space to accommodate it). Then I rinse everything afterwards.

Everytime you leave a room, pick up after yourself rather than just leaving it for later. Makes it so much more manageable.

And truthfully it feels nice to live in a clean place. Plus cleaning your own place improves self-esteem and makes a nice study break when brain full.

#### Lower your standards. Chances are it took your parents a long time to afford a certain quality of life that you are no longer taking part of.

I have some friends that went $15,000 into debt so they could furnish their place like their parent's house. My wife and I slept on a mattress topper that we stole from the dorms for first two years of our marriage because we couldn't afford a bed. Couldn't afford a box spring either so we just put it on the floor, Japanese futon style.

A good bed is important. You spend around a third of your life in it. I'm curious if they couldn't afford anything or if the bed was just low on their priorities.

#### Make sure you have cold medicine and a thermometer. One day you'll wake up feeling like you've been hit by a truck and you really won't want to have to go to the store for NyQuil. Same goes for band-aids & condoms. Own before you need.

Don't take any cold medicine unless you absolutely need it to function (at work etc). Taking it usually prolongs the symptoms a few more days. Easiest way to explain this is that acetaminophen works as an anti-inflammatory, and reducing inflammation leads to a reduced immune response to pathogens and viruses.

#### Everything is way more expensive than you think. All the things you might take for granted, like towels, toilet paper, even soap adds up quickly.

The first time I bought razors after moving out of my parents' house was mind blowing. I now put those at the top of my Christmas list every year.
 
STOCK THE FUCK UP DURING SALES. Two for one packages of toilet paper? Buy ten.

#### buy a bucket. seriously multi use mother fucker.

Also, eventually you might need to puke from bed. God bless the bucket.

#### When you need something, always check THRIFT stores first. You'd be surprised how many "like new" items you will find. Takes some time to fish through it all but saving $10 here and there adds up. You don't need brand new stuff when you're starting out....or ever actually.

With the exception of 2 bookshelves that were $15 each at IKEA because I couldn't find anything decent at local thrift stores, all of my furniture is secondhand. Tables are from rummage sales last summer, my dresser is from Craigslist, my TV is from St Vincent DePaul, etc. Just took a little cleaning and paint, but I saved a hell of a lot of money.

Craigslist and freecycle are fantastic ways to get cheap or free furniture. Yeah, IKEA is nice, but if you can get some well made furniture for free it might last you a whole hell of a lot longer.

And if you're picky about style, just shop around for a while and you'll find something at least close to what you want. Thrift stores arent always full of 70's floral and paisley.

I moved out of my parent's house a few years ago and was amazed how little furniture I had do fill up the tiny house I rented. Now almost all of the furniture I have I either bought second hand or picked up from friends who moved away (great benefit of living in a college town!)

Side post on a random throwaway, but if you can get access to a drill, you can build a lot of furniture. Seriously, forget IKEA.
I do serious carpentry on the side, but a lot of my personal furniture comes from when i didnt have much time or money, and I would go buy a piece of pine from lowes, make them cut it to length (I think like 75C a cut, worth it at the time), and put it all together (tables, bookshelves, etc.).
A drill, two drill bits, and about 20 bucks gets you any piece of non upholstered furniture you want, and it can look good if you want it to.

#### Don't live with more than 3 other people. More than that and it gets real messy. With two other people its hard for someone to hide their messiness but 3 or more others and it starts to get out of hand and before you know it everyone is messy as hell because they think "why bother being tidy when someone else is just going to fuck it up?"

#### Lock your doors. Also consider buying a small safe for important papers, valuables, etc. If anyone comes to the door from the gas, electric or some other company, don't be afraid to ask for ID.

#### The great thing about living on your own is that you have a lot of freedom to do whatever you want (such as browse Reddit in your undies). However, the drawback to having so much freedom is that there's a lot of responsibility as well, and your parents aren't there anymore to stay on top of you. Thus, learning to be self-disciplined and responsible is critical. You need to learn how to balance a budget, pay bills on time, cook your own meals, and perform basic maintenance of your living space

Also: make a lot of lists, and stick to them.
In terms of grocery shopping: Always check your inventory before you go grocery shopping, and make a list of everything you need before you leave. Nothing sucks more than getting home and realizing you forgot to buy sugar, lightbulbs or whatever.
In terms of everything else: to-do lists help you to wrap your head around everything that still needs doing. (Plus you remember everything you've already done more clearly, because you've crossed it off the list already)
Lists save you a lot of time and money.

#### Lots

- Get a vacuum cleaner ASAP. If you manage to track in mud, you'll spend a lot of time scrubbing it without one
- I buy cheap bathroom mats because it can be cheaper to replace the mat than to wash it at the apartment laundry
- Even though buying long-lasting items usually pays off in the long-run, sometimes buying a low-end item to hold you out can save you from financial problems. Definitely consider the former if you absolutely know the item will last or the premium isn't that high
- Have a savings strategy. If you cannot manage to budget, try something simpler. For example, at every pay day, transfer x amount of your pay into savings. Someone suggested depositing your paycheck straight into savings.
- If you need to stay at a hotel for 5 or more days, the hotel probably has a special rate. If traveling between states, get a hotel coupon book, usually at the state information centers!
- Have a huge load of color laundry but a small load of whites? Consider white, bleachable towels if your color load is too much
- Never, and I repeat, NEVER pass up a good deal on quality toilet paper.
- If you have roommates, be honest and vocal about things that bother you as soon as it happens. Letting passive aggressive animosity brew is the worst of living situations when it could all be cleared with one small conversation. It may be uncomfortable but it's worth living in a house without being pissed off all the time. But don't forget to be willing to compromise as well.
- Stay light weighted. Be it college, moving out of your parents, or finding a home, have only the essential things you need or else they will just clutter as trash. Im about to move out from my college place, and I realized how much junk and clothes I horded that had no uses or I felt I spent money on wastefully.
- Make a list of things you want or need by room and cross the items off as you go. I categorized mine by living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and miscellaneous. Writing it down will make you feel much more accomplished than keeping it in a spreadsheet or a word document. One of my proudest moments was crossing 'level' off my list because it was the last item!
- Everything and I mean everything will cost more than your budget. You do have a budget right?
- Buy only the essentials until you have a firm grasp of how much you need to hold on to every month. Try not to dip into savings unless it is critical. You do have savings and a savings plan right???
- There are tons of startup costs. If your mom and/or dad want to loan or give you starter sheets, towels, pots, pans, etc good for them and take what they offer. It will save you money that you WILL need later.
- Don't procrastinate when the sink is dripping. Every drop is costing you money. I had a $250 water bill one month from a leaky toilet. It was a very expensive lesson. Likewise for any other repair whether it is on your car or elsewhere. You can't afford to pay a cab to shuttle you around and friends are only going to go so far out of their way to help.
- Have emergency plans. What will you do if you get the flu for a week? What happens if the car craps up and won't run? Where can I get food within walking distance? How will I pay for the parking ticket?
- Don't mistake any surplus as disposable income, you'll need that later for when you get that big electricity bill or your car breaks down. Get a savings account separate to your main accounts and put money in it weekly even if it's a small amount. Do this like clockwork for a year or so and you'll start to have a good idea of how personal finances will work now that you're on your own.
- Make sure you know how to change a lightbulb[1] properly.
- If ou are going to have roommates, go visit their current bedroom. If it is a mess, consider what the new place will look like. Get a place close to your work...make sure you plan on hanging onto that job awhile. Try to pay less than you can afford, even if it is shitty, you'll be able to save quicker, and build up better credit by having more to spend elsewhere. Good credit is like gold as you get older. Make sure you budget for all bills. Cell, insurance, water/garbage, electric, wi fi etc. The electric and water companies can probably tell you what the bills averaged for the last resident to give you a clue. I could go on...sorry, dad mode kicked in.
- Do your chores immediately. Washing dishes immediately after cooking/eating is a hell of a lot easier than if they've been sitting around for a week. Taking out trash as soon as it's full will keep your place from smelling like crap. Stuff like that - it sounds obvious, but damn if it wasn't in every person I knew who had just gone out on their own.
- Cracker barrel and a jar of peanut butter. No matter how good of a cook you are, or how many meals you already bought, at some point there's going to be a day where you're walking around the place opening the pantry and fridge doors every 2 minutes wondering what the hell to eat.
- And don't be ashamed to be an adult with chocolate milk. You need calcium all your life and if it encourages you to drink a glass a day over plain, go for it.
- Keep a record of everything. All your rent slips, bill payments, etc. With any sort of landlord dispute or problem try to send them an email or written letter of complaint/concern etc. and try not to lose your cool. Sometimes the landlords are trying to con you but othertimes it's a mistake or something that could be fixed with some communication.
- You probably will be living with someone(s) in the beginning or at some time. Respect people's space and lock your shit up.
- Best piece of advice I can give is take HEAPS of photos before you move into a place. Landlords, and especially property management firms, can be really big ass holes when it comes to trying to get you to pay for "your" damage.
- Get spice jars (I like magnetic ones with clear lids, I stick them on my fridge) and then buy bulk spices. Even with the jars it'll be much cheaper than regularly packaged spices.
- Cook in bulk, freeze leftovers for later usage. From stew or soup to chili and casserole, they all are all easy to make, last for awhile, and tastes amazing when reheated. There are sites such as
- Keep your physical and mental health in check. Assuming you have a daytime job, eat breakfast and do a short exercise routine before you go to work. It will make you more alert throughout the day and you will feel great. See a movie, go out with friends, go out on a date, etc. You do not have to go and spend 100 dollars at the bar each week. A 10 dollar movie every couple of weeks with someone significant or by yourself will help relax you. Maybe go hiking or hang out at the Walmart parking lot with your friends or something.
- Don't poison your body with chemicals and processed foods. Buy a bunch of meat up front, season it and stick it in the fridge for a few days. After than cook all of it and bag it into individual portions. toss your ready to go chicken beef etc with some veggies and rice and save your body years of bullshit.
- Don't buy stupid shit you can't afford, take out loans or loan out money. Pay the necessities, save your money and learn about securing an actual future financially. So many people live above their means and complain how, at 40, they are drowning in financial slavery (debt) and miserable. If you save roughly 25 a week at a modest interest bearing account, you could have a mil saved up by the time you're ready to retire. Of course, a million by then might be 25 bucks today.
