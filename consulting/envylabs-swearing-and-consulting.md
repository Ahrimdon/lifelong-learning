# Swearing and Consulting
[link](http://blog.envylabs.com/post/68783089387/swearing-and-consulting)

1. Put phone number on website, people want to call.
2. Make yourself look human. People hate corporatey thing.
3. Steal a good Services Agreement (New Leaders).
4. Always get money up front. Get a deposit, or prepayment. Prepay = you can offer discount.
5. Never do fixed bid contracts, because things change.
6. Always be able to walk away. If we don't agree, let's work it out.
7. Strive to be transparent. Show them where the hours get spent.
8. Put systems in place to force yourself to communicate (status calls).
9. Don't be afraid to apologize to your clients.
10. It's okay to eat hours, but let your clients know about it. "Sorry we estimated..."
11. Disqualify leads as soon as possible.
12. Follow up. You can go back a month later and ask them.
13. Surround yourself with people you can hire.
14. Don't try to manage your friends. Nobody is salaried, everyone is hourly billed. It doesn't matter if you work 20 hours per week, you just want to meet the client expectation.
15. Learn how to delegate. Figure out how to have systems in place so developers work on stuff and PMs work on project.
16. Don't be afraid to take on more work than you can handle. Hire?
17. Never pass up on work, maybe someone is building a consultancy, just ask for 10%.
