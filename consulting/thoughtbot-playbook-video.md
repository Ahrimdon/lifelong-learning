# Planning

Each project has one visionary: one person only and he protects the concept of the idea. Over weeks, the original idea is going to be compromised. People come up with ideas but if you don't believe the core, the idea will be broken.

Customers are good at describing their problems and are terrible at describing their solutions. It is almost good to blantantly disregard their solution.

Get out of the building. Talk to the customers where they live.

Too often the first thing that people do is to put a landing page. We believe that that's wrong. If you're going to spend PR effort to drive people towards a landing page that collects email addresses, that's wasted effort. Just ask them to sign up to working software. You don't need to build an audience via a landing page. Build a landing page via reputation.

Start blogging about the area of your solution. When you're finally ready to launch, you can sign up the audience. We've developed this through our own experiences. The people who put their email addresses are the same people who'd sign up on day 1 anyway.

A landing page sets an expectation that you are going to launch. But how if you aren't going to launch lol. That effort is wasted. Just build great software and build reputation.

First step, sketching. Written specifications are wasted effort. Put your pen to use actually sketching what the UI is going to look like. The majority of what happens in the software is manifested in the UI anyway. As the UI moves form sketch to screen, you are working in the same medium, the UI.

It's harder for us to look both a picture and think we are misunderstanding each other. It is important that everyone has to be together in the user sketches. You'll end up building software that not everyone understands. 

Sketches are not an artifact which are going to serve beyond that initial process. Everyone just needs something as a starting point. Because sketches are rudimentary, we can discard things easier. 

Whenever there is a question, we try to answer things as soon as possible but we can say that "okay we will worry about this in a bit". Relax a bit. Instead of fighting the change, embrace it. Keep your process as lightweight and as flexible as possible, because things will change based on feedback.
