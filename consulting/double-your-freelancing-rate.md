[link](http://nimblegecko.com/notes-on-double-your-freelancing-rate-book/)

Company wants to hire you so you help them save or earn more money than they spend on you, and they don't care about your best technical practices.

Two types of clients: Pragmatic and Dreamer. *Pragmatic* clients have clear objectives in terms of what will happen in terms of visitors, sales, conversion etc. *Dreamer* is more of an idea man that asks for revisions as things go along.

*Questions*
- Why are some clients pragmatic, and why some clients dreamers?
- What problems have pragmatic, and what problems have dreamers caused you?

*Approach*
- "Bob, tell me more about your website": Respond with a description problem, namely a website.
- "If your website was an employee, what would his job description be like?": Business goal.
- "And how does your current site achieve that?": It doesn't.

Brendan has a desire to uncover the business objective, need, or a problem. _Not the solution immediately, like the competitor did._

Be value-driven vs. cost-driven. The positioning is how your *client will allow them to achieve their business goals*, revenue targets, and how they are going to miss out on those by not implementing them.

*Experiential factor.* Client's experience matters - it is the most important component of the received value. The way you communicate with a client (quickness and professionalism) and a clear plan of action.

*Economic factor* Need to make sure that your implementation will allow the client to *achieve their business goals*, and not lose money on you. The conversations around their business, their needs and your abilities to fulfill those needs as a solutions provider form the basis for your premium rate.

*Questions*
- What things about working with you have your clients loved/hated?
- What satisfies you the most about working on client projects?
- What could you cahnge or remove that would improve the experience your clients have working with you?

*Client's budget*
- Based on the money in the bank, how much is allocated to that project $Y and risk margin $Z
- Arbitrary number is based on their interaction with other freelancers, off the Internet etc.
- Determine what their budget is and at least a range.

*Quantifying value*
- What is the client looking for in a vendor?
- Instead of focusing on technicalities such as color, CMS, Maps, ask biz questions and understand answers. Solve the biz problem, not the tech problem.
- Experiential: _Notion of capitalization on the ego of the client_ - Biz owner is jealous of competitor's website, so suggest the line of "We're in this together, soon you'll be bragging to your friend about the results you're getting online".
- Economic value: You need to measure how the client measures his success: hits, FB, sales, clients, etc.

## Your Offer
- Segmentation: Is client pragmatic or dreamer? Do you want to work with that sort of client?
- Values: What does the client vaue most?
- Potential/Risk: Can you deliver this premium project to a client, will you have enough motivation and technical capabilities?

## Be Direct
- Why do you want this built?
- What are the economic implications to it not being built?
- What is the economic potential of successful completion?
- What reserach did you do?
- Why can't you do this internally?
- Time constraints
- What is success?

 Next: Have a roadmap for success.. *The goal is to disconnect the relationship between a buget and scope of work, so you can figure out the business motivations between a budget and scope of work.* When the roadmap is ready, estimate the complexity and put up the premium price against items.

 The framing is: _Here's what we can do for you. It' prioritized to get you the maximum return for your investment. Please have a look at how much each part of the project would cost so you could fit this within your budget and refine it further (if required) to align with your business goals._

# Sales Strategy

1. *PROPOSAL.* No timelines, deal details, costs. Confidence is important -- acting like there's no doubt whether he'll get a contract or not. What are the client's motivations for the project? Then he can verbally offer ideas and experiments to get client closer to the goal. Important concept: *Open-ended roadmap:* Something that they are going to produce together.

2. *CLOSING THE DEAL.* Focus on economic value. What's it like working with you, your rate, estimated time and total cost, client requirements. Client will most likely focus on the budget side. Tell them you can limit the scope to fit the budget. When client is happy, request 2 week deposit.

3. *CONTACTS VIA YOUR SALES WEBSITE.* When getting contacted, send short reply: "Thanks, got the email, out at the moment".

Qualify client.

- Can they afford you?
- When do they start?
- Is this a direct client?
- Are they responsible for paying?
- Custom software?

## Ask them questions.
- Why this project?
- Budget?
- Start date?
- Are they the project owner?
- New type of project or have they done this before?

## Negotiation
- Don't be afraid to turn the client down.
- *Don't not negotiate.*
  - Holding strong and not negotiating will RARELY cost you a project.
  - People are afraid to lose projects and are happy to work for a little less.
  - Realize the value you are delivering to your client.
  - Let clients know they can fire you if they feel you are not worth the cost.
  - YOU ARE A BIZ, not just some technical web guy.
