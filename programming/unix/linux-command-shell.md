## What is the Shell
[Reference](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php)

- On most Linux systems, a program called `bash` (Bourne Again Shell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program) acts as the shell program, though these can also be things like `zsh`.
- Terminal: A terminal emulator. This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell (ex: iTerm).
- If the last character of your shell is `#` rather than `$`, you are operating as the superuser.

## Navigation

- Absolute: Begins with the root directory.
