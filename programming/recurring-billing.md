1. *Your product or service needs to work with recurring billing, and with some creativity, it probably can.* Amazon Prime is a great deal because the products and services lend themselves naturally to a subscription model. It's easy to monetize an annual or monthly plan to get your streaming videos, music, and quick shipping.

Other examples: shaving products, flying service (for frequent travelers), clothing/accessories, counseling (preferred appointments, greater level of access to counselors, unlimited coaching questions.

Regarding a proposal for a sock-of-the-month service, he said, “How many pairs of socks does a guy really need? Once I get a few months’ worth, I’ll cancel, and that's not a good subscription model.”

2. *Setting up subscription billing is easier said than done. It will cost time and money.*

Until recently, it's been a challenge to set up a custom approach for a subscription service that works, especially one that has customer options and is designed to match the unique needs of a product or service. You need an engineer for this :)

3. *Provide an experience, not just a plain vanilla service.*

The most successful recurring billing services get a lot of things right. They are a good deal (Amazon Prime), they have unique products (Standard Cocoa), they’re convenient (Manpacks), and they are often sort of necessary (PetFlow).

NatureBox: Though there are many food delivery services, the founders focused on experience. Focus on the customer journey.

Subscription services take it to a deeper level. The customer is prepared to make a purchase that could keep repeating itself for months, maybe years. The experience leading up to and following from that point are extremely significant for that customer's retention.

KiwiCrate: Provides a monthly craft for children to work on. The website itself gives you a sense of the kind of experience that children and parents can expect.

4. *You need to worry about dunning.*

When you start your subscription service, you can't merely expect for the money to freely flow into your coffers. Credit cards expire about every three years. Credit cards get canceled for the darndest reasons. Credit cards hit spend limits. Credit cards get separated from their owners.

If you manage dunning yourself, you’ll have to create systems and processes for counter checking cards, sending email reminders, anticipating expiration dates, suspending accounts, communicating with suspended accounts, discontinuing product delivery for nonpaying accounts, retrying declined cards, and investigating the causes for declined payments.

Inc. calls subscription businesses “pure genius” which is precisely John Warrillow’s perspective: “It’s the perfect business model because it provides the greatest value to both the entrepreneur and the customer.”
