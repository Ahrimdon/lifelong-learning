# Marshmallow test

- Bias towards action and prototyping.
- Note not just what the users need, but what the biz needs and what the tech constraints are.
- Design doesn't just happen on a poster or picture frame, everything can be designed.
- Creative process: Beginning with a lot of confusion, you just make mistakes, eventually we get something that does work and we can make it a little better.
- Fuzzy Front-end: We start from an uncertain start and we go through a point of certainty. To manage the hack, we can do it deliberately.
- Divergent vs. Convergent thinking. Divergent thinking means you have more possibilities because of the crazy ideas.
- Convergent thinking - Keeping things realistic, pairing what could be possible to do given all the constraints. What is the real objective?
- Most things in the biz is in convergent, so that is why there are a lot of industries which are ripe for disruption. So it matters what kind of thinking you use.

Needs of people + technology + needs of business.

Reward users with free load time to fill out things etc. Mobile usage is characterized by text, so turn that into insight.

There is usually a few observations. A lot of companies just jump right into the field. They are about getting the insights.

Chernobyl user interface, sucky. Example of design from the technology point of view, not from the human point of view. UX is not just about screens, they are the current most popular interfaces, the phone is the most popular interfaces in the Philippines.

Something being usable is implied whenever a product is fantastic. UX is about the slam dunk, this guy bought shoes because he wanted to be up in the air. Put technology to serve around people's needs, not making the users learn the technology.

Paper, prototyping (actual thing), is the concept even solving the right problem in the first place? Sketching/doing prototype, we are able to test with real users faster and very cheaply. It should be a lot more obvious to do this. Biz people don't like prototyping that much.

Personas: Better to have a "real life person" to avoid the opinion thing, when we have a design tool it is better. If the problem is not a problem on the screen, you can't fix it.  Product in the slam dunk: shoe. Experience: Feeling awesome while dunking. Businesses sell shoes. People buy "the dunk".

*Product + Service = Experience*

UX transforms products into experience (it sits in the service layer). You can't design an experience, but you can design for an experience. UX is the language of service innovation/service improvement. You are just transforming the product you have into the experience you want.

Users are a fiction. User is a person. User is just like you. Think of users as people. User = technology-centric, "this uses our technology". Understanding how people think is key.

Mental models: A tool for understanding how a person sees the world.

User interfaces to influence behavior: Cialdini stuff, reciprocity. Surprising service thingie. Book authors - first chapter is free. By giving the first chapter for free, we are encouraging to buy the second thing.

Scarcity: People love more the things they can't have. Manufacture scarcity, even if digitally you aren't really limited XD

Authority: Prime sales redirect on "We're an expert on..." Best example is Amazon, people just look for the review, rather than establishing authority.

Small, easy commitments: Best example is dentists, you can leave a appointment, the customer wrote down the appointment instead of the receptionist. +meeting rates of 20%. Digitally, we can let them customize the thing.

Optimizely, you get to use the product at every point until you sign up. When you've done everything, the next step is a bit easier.

Liking: Look for similarities between users, and find rapport. Black Milk: They show the fashion thingies people put on Instagram.

Testimonial = nuclear weapon of marketing. Qwerty, company who wants to make a new product. The people who come up with the idea get % of the revenue.

Company: YoYo, winner of Echelon 2014...

Good thing about the conference:

- Tin led me to my seat. That's pretty awesome.
- Forced seating. I think this is awesome because you have to interact with other people. And you can't have the thing
