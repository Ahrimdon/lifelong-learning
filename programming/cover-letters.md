- Write like you speak, as if told over coffee or beer.
- Informal, but not too casual.
- Right to the point, the first sentence is your summary.
- No BS. If it sounds like BS, it probably is.
- Short, tightly targeted to them. Highlight what's important to them.
- Perfect spelling and grammar.
- Have friends read it, get feedback.
- Does it sound like a good, quick description of you?
- Have at least one differentiator. What makes you so special?
- Strong finish with a call to action.

- These relate to saving the time of the reader. IF something can be said in less and clearer words, do so.
- For some bigger companies, some buzzwords will be needed.
- Small and medium-size companies - "does this person sound like the kind of person I'd like to work with".
- Find unique and recent news about the company to discuss in your cover letter, and why it interests you.
