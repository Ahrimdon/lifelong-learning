## How to respond when you are asked for an estimate?

- Determine the accuracy that you need. Based on the duration, you can quote the estimate in different precision. Saying "5 to 6 months" is different than saying "150 days". If you slip a little into the 7th month, you're still pretty accurate. But if you slip into the 180th or 210th day, not so much.
- Model the system. A model might be a mental model, diagrams, or existing data records. Decompose this model and build estimates from the components. Assign values and error ranges (+/-) to each value.
- Never off-the-cuff it.
- "I do not have enough information right now. It would be a disservice to us both for me to make something up on the spot."
- Bottom up is best. Get a detailed work breakdown, estimate each component then roll it up into a larger number. I find planning poker to be a great technique here.
- State your assumptions. Validate as many as possible given the time frame.
- State explicitly what is included and excluded in the estimate. For example, is review included? Are technical delays included?
- Confidently. I can't tell you how many times I botched up an initial meeting with a client by not putting on professionalism when giving an estimate. Even if you're blowing numbers out of thin air - make sure you always keep some estimate around. That said, be careful not to estimate yourself into a hole.
