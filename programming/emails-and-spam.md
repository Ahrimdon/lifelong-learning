# Mailchimp: About Spam Filters
[link](http://kb.mailchimp.com/delivery/spam-filters/about-spam-filters)

Filters weigh each factor, add them up to a spam score, which determines whether a campaign will pass through the filter.

- *Formatting.* ALL CAPS, crazy colors, extra exclamation points!!!
- *Content.* Anything about getting money/paying less money/money-back guarantee.
- *Code.*
- *Images.* Either too many or one single image.

Spam filters check:

- *Subject line.* Avoid words like free, mortgage, insurance, act now, casino, limited time, coupons, click now, and open immediately. Don't use too much punctuation or special characters.
- *To: field.* Better to send to a Name rather than an email address.
- *Message content.* Since your subscribers have opted-in to your list, they should already know who you are, which means you can avoid any kind of introductions about you or your company.
- *Your IP address.* Some spam filters have blacklisted IP ranges.
- *The From: name and email address.* They verify the sender against the recipient's address book. Spam filters often judge anonymous free email addresses more harshly than verified domains. Higher chance if you have Yahoo/Gmail/etc. Ask your subscribers to add your email address to their address books.
- *Advice from other spam filters.*
