- Commenting/documenting your code properly.
- Scalable/maintainable.
- Integrity--don't push bad code.
- Soft skills--CRM, team management, communication across several management layers.
- Packaging/deployment: CI, CD.
- Testing: Unit, integration, performance, smoke.
- Security: At least, how to prevent SQL attacks.
- Learn to teach and collaborate.
- I bring live demos with me to the interview, so I have a real solution instead of shoe-horned examples in order to test some of the skills.
