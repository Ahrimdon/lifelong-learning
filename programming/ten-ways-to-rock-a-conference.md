## 10 Ways to Rock a Conference
[Reference](http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/03/10-ways-to-rock-a-conference/)

- Conferences pros: look forward to their event because they know they will get new business from it, they know how to work a room and walk up to a stranger, they aren't sleazy, schmoozer types, and they can manage the schedule, land VIP coffees, and kill it at after-parties.

### Your Assets

- *Your badge.* This is your first impression/conversation starter. It is your key to interaction. Make sure your name/company is spelled right. Add conversation starters--vacation spot, music you listened to, interesting fact.
- Business card--I suggest to add your picture to the business card. Bring a ton of cards.

### Pitch Perfect

- Make your pitch niched and specific for conference attendees: "My name is Vanessa and I run a human behavior research lab that looks for patterns on how people use technology."
- Reference the conference: "I'm at so-and-so looking for ideas for my human behavior research lab.
- Reference them if you know what they do from their badge or their introduction--"I help journalists like you find interesting human behavior research to write about."
- Offer: I was invited a trend conference as a blogger, my goal was to find interesting people to cover. I went around offering coverage, there was no real benefit to me, I was just looking for cool people to feature and drive traffic to.
- When thinking about your event, don't think about what you need or what you want to ask for, focus only on what you can offer. How can you help people at the conference? What can you give them? What do you have to offer this conference?
- *When we are in the ask mentality, we are in scarcity and we are in need. When we are in the offer mentality, we are in abundance and we are at ease.*

### The Context Come On

- I never approach someone cold at an event.
- Master the context. Use your location or surroundings to make an opening line and conversation easy.
- Look for lines at conferences because it is the easiest way to meet the person in front and behind you.
- I never pass up the opportunity to get to a session 5 minutes early and sit at a partially full table or block of seats with people.
- Contexts:
  - Lunch table: "Enjoying the conference so far?"
  - Coffee line: "Juicing up for the big keynote?"
  - Bathroom line: "How are you liking today's sessions?"
  - Seat mate: "What brings you to this session?"
  - Badge line: "Come to a lot of conferences like this?"
  - Elevator: "Been to this conference before?"
- **The best pick up line ever: "Hello, how are you?"**

### In Like Flynn

- Starters: "What did you think of the keynote?", "Have you learned anything interesting so far?", "Which break-out session are you going to?", "Any booths I should stop by in the Exhibition Hall?"
- Killer conversation starters
  - "Working on any personal passion projects?"
  - "What are you looking forward to for the rest of the day?"
  - "Working on interesting projects these days?"
  - "Tell me about you."
  - "What's your story?"
  - "What personal passion project are you working on right now?"
  - "Working on anything exciting lately?"
  - "How do you know the host?"
  - "How do you know the host?"
  - "Have you been to an event like this before?"
  - "What was the highlight of your day today?"
  - "What was the highlight of your week?"
  - "What was the high-point and low-point of your day so far?"

### Out Like Scout

- Graceful exit: Genuine Compliment + Follow-up Item + Handshake = Graceful Exit.
- "It's been a pleasure talking to you.", "I loved hearing about your business idea".
- "I'll follow-up with you on email", "Hope to see you at the after-party tonight", "Pass me your business card and I'll find you on LinkedIn".
- Handshake: clear cue that you want to exit.

### Tricks of the Trade

- Look at the agenda to see which sessions you want to prioritize. Get a map if it is a big conference so you aren't relying on slow wifi connections to figure out where you are going.
- Beware of conference buddies--it is hard to network well when you are with someone else.
- Use the event hashtag.
- Thank the organizers and conference planning committee.
