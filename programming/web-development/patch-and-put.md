# What is the main difference between PATCH and PUT request?
[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21660791/what-is-the-main-difference-between-patch-and-put-request)

- `PUT`: If I want to change my first name and send put request for update, I would need to send everything because I want to replace.
- `PATCH`: Only send the data about which one you want to update and it won't affect or change other data.
