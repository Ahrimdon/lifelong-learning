Features are written from the end users.

Collection of user stories: A product backlog which users want.

Product owner: We make sure the right features are owned by this person.
Scrum master: Makes sure that the team has everything that they need to get things working.
Developer and testers.

Release planning: Based on project backlog. Then put them on the release backlog. To estimates stuff, do story points. What we can do is to work in terms of hours. Either 1, 2, 4, or 8 hour buckets. Days are in 2, 3, 5, 10 days.

Release backlog: Needs sprints, short day milestone.

Let's plan release cycles. We can split things up and at the end of the sprint, we are able to make sure the product works. We have to make sure we can monitor the sprint. Burndown chart: Day by day measure to know the amount of work remaining. We can use the slope of the release time to rush the dev time or not.
