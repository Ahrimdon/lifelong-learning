# How To Not Be Stumped By Trees

- Linear data structures (arrays/linked lists): the data is ordered, that order matters, the way you traverse a linear data structure is directly related to its order.
- N nodes always means n-1 links and edges.
- Trees are recursive data structures because a tree is usually composed of smaller trees inside of it.
- Depth: How far away is the node from the root of the tree?
- Height: how far is the node from its farthest leaf?
- Balanced tree: if the two sibling subtrees do not differ in height by more than one sub-level.
- Practical application: file systems.
