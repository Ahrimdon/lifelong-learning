# What is Turing Complete?
[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete)

- A TC system means a system in which a program can be written that will find an answer (no guarantees regarding runtime or memory).
- A TC language is one that can perform any computation. The Church-Turing thesis states that any performable computation can be done by a Turing machine (a machine with infinite RAM and a finite 'program' that dictates when it should read, write, and move across that memory.

- In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules is said to be Turing complete or computationally universal it it can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine.
- Calculator: not a Turing machine, because it can only perform a small, pre-defined subset of calculations.
- PowerPoint: A Turing machine (you can use auto-shapes and the click thing).
