- Bitcoin transfers are not free (contrast to Venmo).
- Blockchain: a linear log, replicated by computers whose owners (miners) are rewarded for logging new transactions.
  - Historical record and each participant has an incentive to go with the consensus.
- Instead of relying on trust or regulation, in the blockchain world, individuals are on-purpose responsible for their own security precautions: they need to make sure the software isn't malicious or buggy.
- Ex of trust: buying an e-book, what trust do you rely on?
  - You know/trust who wrote the smart contract.
  - Seller has a reputation to uphold.
  - Friends have bought from the seller in the past.
  - Hoping the seller deals fairly.
- Making an actual system?
  - Of the bitcoins (93% of all) mined by managed consortiums, none of them use smart contracts to managed payouts.
  - Trusted is better than trustless?
  - Projects based on the elimination of trust have failed to capture customersâ€™ interest because trust is actually so damn valuable.
  - Why not just create an actual computer system than rely on blockchain?

## Comments:

- It is useful but only when you're trying to circumvent an authority.
- Some rich traders would like to do anonymous trading and avoid pesky laws on paying taxes on trading profits/not doing insider trading.
- The problems that blockchain can solve are problems where you don't want to be seen.
- *Blockchain hinders the effort to make institutions more trustworthy by empowering even-more-untrustworthy institutions, by distracting motivated people from real solutions, and, when it collapses, by discouraging society as a whole from believing a better world is possible or that technology can be a force for good.*
