# Smart Contract
[Reference]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)

- "I call these contracts smart, because they are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of AI. It is a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises."
- Implementations:
  - Bitcoin. Allows the creation of custom smart contracts on top of BTC like multi-signature accounts, payment channels, escrows, time locks, atomic cross-chain trading, oracles, or multi-party lottery with no operator.
  - Ethereum: Implements a nearly Turing-complete language on its blockchain.
  - Ripple.
  - Rootstock: Connected to the BTC blockchain through sidechain technology.

# Smart Contracts: The Blockchain Technology That Will Replace Lawyers
[Reference](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/)

- Because a blockchain is decentralized, there's no need to pay intermediaries and it saves you time and conflict.
- A decentralized ledger could be used for smart contracts. The computers would store, replicate, and supervise those contracts.
- Instead of paying a lawyer for a notary, you can theoretically drop a bitcoin into the vending machine.
- Vitalik: In a smart contract approach, an asset or currency is transferred into a program, the program runs this code and at some point it automatically validates ta condition, then determines whether the asset should go to one person or back to the other person.
- Ex: Renting an apartment with cryptocurrency, this would be enforced with the blockchain. The system would have an If-Then promise that is witnessed by hundreds of people, and so you can expect a faultless delivery.

- Government: voting.
- Management: one process that is seen by many people.
- Supply chain: a smart contact can theoretically ensure that something was bought. Not like the system right now that has many paper processes.

- On why smart contracts are awesome:
  - Autonomy: You're the one making the agreement.
  - Trust: The document is encrypted on a shared ledger.
  - Backup: On the blockchain, the documents are duplicated many times over.
  - Savings: No intermediary.
