# This 90-Day Plan Turns Engineers into Remarkable Managers
[Reference](http://firstround.com/review/this-90-day-plan-turns-engineers-into-remarkable-managers/)

- Which methods have been helpful for learning to manage effectively: "trial and error", feedback, observing peers.
- You need to have relationships with: your team (can you lead engineers), your peers (can you work well with your fellow managers), and your manager (can you give clear snapshots).
- This is an entirely new job. You now have people whose happiness and effectiveness at work rests largely on your shoulders. You're responsible for the results but can't do it all yourself.
- Look out for this:
  - *Don't manage in order to please the boss.*
  - *Don't manage only to advance your career.*
  - *Manage if growth for you involves others.* You can view interns as a time-suck or as an opportunity to groom a better engineer.
  - *Manage if you channel empathy.*
  - *Manage if you can give the trust you ask of others.* Most important tip: don't lie. Don't share sensitive information from a one-on-one meeting.
- Trust, but verify.
- Continuous career conversations: what are your career goals? Keep being an engineer, be a manager, do a startup, be a recognized technical expert.

- ***Education:*** Peopleware, The Mythical Man-Month, First, Break All the Rules. Don't hide your study sessions: when you block time for your education, own it. Find a management mentor. Get guidance from your boss.
- ***Find your rhythm.*** Cancel meetings: honor and defend their judgment re: meetings. Build an event loop: Did I do the things I need to do for the day, week, and month?

- ***Assessment.***
  - What is unique about each team member and your plan to capitalize on it?
  - Good debugger vs good software designer, self-awareness.
  - Evaluating performance:
    - How is the quality of the software been?
    - How have they been doing with their milestones?
    - How's the morale?

# On Code Review
[Reference](https://medium.com/@9len/on-code-review-16ea85f7c585)

- Make it a top priority, and figure out the best way to work it into your event loop.
- Make the requests a pleasure to read.
- *Pending code reviews represent blocked threads of execution.*
- Don't put code review off for more than a few hours.
- Prioritize code review above most work.
- Expect to spend time on CR every day, throughout the day. Carefully review the diff before publishing.
- Keep review requests as small as possible.
- Acknowledge comments quickly.

# The Outrageous Cost of Skipping TDD & Code Reviews
[Reference](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-outrageous-cost-of-skipping-tdd-code-reviews-57887064c412)

- 30% longer with TDD, but reduce production bug density by 40-80%.
- Fixing a production bug costs 100x more than fixing a bug at design time, and over 15x more than fixing a bug at implementation time.

# How to get a Team Lead job
[Reference](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-get-a-team-lead-job-2c47d8fee618)

- Tech lead: tech agenda, coding. Gets work done and networks only when needed.
- Team lead: middle of tech lead and engineering lead, sometimes coding.
- Engineering manager: long-term team success, managing direct reports, almost no coding.
- Team lead: negative communication and process changes go to you first, then you filter them and take actions accordingly. Enjoy growing people, identifying personal agendas, and helping them achieve it by crushing obstacles.
- Developing soft skills: organizing people to achieve big goals together.
- Micromanagement stalls work, and you must promote ownership and autonomy.
- Prerequisite: being senior. A popular blog, project, and mentoring practice.
- Hard skills: software development. Soft skills: self-management, strategy, working with people, resource management, analysis/decisions making.

# Seniority
[Reference](http://merowing.info/2017/01/seniority/)

- Tech skills come to you naturally with years.
- Reliable: being able to gauge when your pieces of the puzzle are ready. Seniors are proactive and do not sit on their hands until they are assigned new tasks.
- Accountable: making mistakes and hitting roadblocks is normal. More experienced people know that when it happens, they should let other people know.
- Flexible: Languages and frameworks will always change per career.
- Pragmatic: delivering things matters. The business side matters.
- Working with others.
  - Leading by example.
  - Listening and learning from others. Do not leverage your power or seniority. Use factual arguments. Avoid being reactive. Discussions can get heated, but a professional understands that a critique of an idea is not the same as the critique of a person.
  - Mentoring: everyone should be comfortable asking me questions, whether it's learning how to do something or questioning my decisions. Awful managers make people afraid to ask questions. The mythical 10x engineer helps other people grow.
  - Wanting to fight for a healthy team culture: if someone is misbehaving, do not be afraid to speak up.
