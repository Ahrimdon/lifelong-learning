## Operating at Staff

- Much of the work you're doing has a slower feedback cycle.

## Work on What Matters
[Reference](https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters)

- Only through pacing your career to your life can you sustain yourself for the long-term.
- Snacking: Easy and low impact tasks. Psychologically rewarding, but other people can do this, too.
  - Psychologically rewarding - self-determine your work, don't do low-effort low-impact quality work.
- Preening:
  - High visibility but not high impact. These are work that is of dubious value, but is recognized in company meetings.
  - This is why you have to be in a company that aligns with your intended personal growth.
  - You do not want to be a vanity hire of a senior leader or to present yourself in the way that a company believes leaders look and act.
- Ghosts:
  - Low impact, high effort.
  - "Fixing something broken" because you're a new hire when it really probably isn't.
- ***Work where there's room and attention.***
  - Swarm to existential problems, but if a problem isn't existential, then you should be skeptical of adding your efforts where everyone's already focused.
  - Effective places to work at: Those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work.
  - At some point, work will need support - you'll want to teach a company to value something that it doesn't care about so that things will be faster.
- Foster growth:
  - Hiring funnel.
- Edit
  - With your organisational privilege, relationships, and the ability to see around corners, you can often shift a project's outcomes by investing the smallest ounce of effort, and this is some of the most valuable work you can do.
- Finishing things - Sometimes just a few tweaks can be done to change a six-month slog into a two-week sprint with almost identical impact.
- What you can accomplish:
  - An intersection of what you're good at and what you genuinely care about.
  - Writing company strategy, convincing a great candidate to join, tackling tech debt, or crafting an API.
- ***Why this matters: Suppose you're interviewing for a new role twenty years into your career. Will the folks interviewing you understand your real impact on any of your previous projects or companies? No, I guarantee they won't. Instead, you'll find yourself judged by a series of surprisingly subjective measures: your accumulated prestige, the titles you've had and companies you've worked at, your backchannel reputation, and how you present in your interview process.***

## Writing engineering strategy
[Reference](https://staffeng.com/guides/engineering-strategy)

- To write an engineering strategy, write five design documents, and pull the similarities out. That's your engineering strategy. To write an engineering vision, write five engineering strategies, and forecast their implications two years into the future. That's your engineering vision.
- Durably useful engineering strategy and vision are the output of iterative, bottom-up organizational learning. As such, all learning contributes to your organization's strategy and vision, but your contribution doesn't have to be so abstract. Even if you're not directly responsible for that work, there are practical steps that you can take to advance your organization's strategy and vision, starting right now.
- You should write design documents for any project whose capabilities will be used by numerous future projects. You should also write design documents for projects that meaningfully impact your users. You should write a design document for any work taking more than a month of engineering time.
- Simple template, gather and review together but write alone.
- ***Good strategies guide tradeoffs and explain the rationale behind that guidance. Bad strategies state a policy without explanation, which decouples them from the context they were made. Without context, your strategy rapidly becomes incomprehensible--why did they decide this?--and difficult to adapt as the underlying context shifts.***
- Writing a strategy document
  - Start where you are.
  - Write the specifics.
  - Be opinionated.
  - Show your work.
- Extrapolate into a vision;
  - Write two to three years out.
  - Ground in your business and your users.
  - Be optimistic rather than audacious.

## Manage technical quality
[Reference](https://staffeng.com/guides/manage-technical-quality)

- If there's one thing that engineers, engineering managers, and technology executives are likely to agree on, it's that there's a crisis of technical quality. One diagnosis and cure is easy to identify: our engineers aren't prioritizing quality, and we need to hire better engineers or retrain the ones we have.
- **In most cases, low technical quality isn't a crisis; it's the expected, normal state. Engineers generally make reasonable quality decisions when they make them, and successful companies raise their quality bar over time as they scale, pivot, or shift up-market towards enterprise users. At a well-run and successful company, most of your previous technical decisions won't meet your current quality threshold. Rather than a failure, closing the gap between your current and target technical quality is a routine, essential part of effective engineering leadership.**
- The problem:
  - **You must balance quality across multiple timeframes, and those timeframes generally have conflicting needs. For example, you'll do very different work getting that critical partnership out the door for next week's deadline versus building a platform that supports launching ten times faster next quarter.**
- **Process rollout requires humans to change how they work, which you shouldn't undertake lightly. Rather than reaching for process improvement, start by donning the performance engineer's mindset. Measure the problem at hand, identify where the bulk of the issue occurs, and focus on precisely that area.**
- Sure, you can roll out a new training program to teach your team how to write better tests, but alternatively, maybe you can just delete the one test file where 98% of test failures happen. That's the unreasonable effectiveness of prioritizing hot spots and why it should be the first technique you use to improve technical quality.
