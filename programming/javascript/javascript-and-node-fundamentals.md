# Javascript Fundamentals

Expressiveness: Easy to write code that's easy to understand, both for the compiler and for a human reader. Two factors: intuitively readable constructs, and the lack of boilerplate code.

Neil Gafter: "In my mind, a language construct is expressive if it enables you to write and use an API that can't be written and used without the construct. Programmers who have become accustomed to programming with closures find them very useful for factoring out common code in ways that are not currently possible in Java.

Loose typing: String, Number (integer/real), Boolean, Undefined, Null.

## Prototypal Nature

No classes in JS because objects inherit directly from other objects which is called prototypal inheritance.
