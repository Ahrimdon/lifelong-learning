# Understanding TypeScriptâ€™s type notation
[Reference](https://2ality.com/2018/04/type-notation-typescript.html)

- Typescript `--strict` setting
  - `--noImplicitAny`: If TS can't infer a type, you must specify it
  - `--noImplicitThis`
  - Use JS strict mode.
  - ``null` must be explicitly mentioned.
  - `--strictFunctionTypes`: really checks for function types.
- JS language has 7 types:
  - `undefined`
  - `null`
  - Boolean
  - Number
  - String
  - Symbol
  - Object (includes functions and arrays)
- Type annotation: `let x: number`
- Type inference: `let x = 123`.
- `undefined` as a value and `undefined` as a type are both written as `undefined`.
- Arrays:
  - List means all elements have the same type.
  - Tuple: The length of the array if fixed, and the elements do not necessarily have the same type.
- Optional parameters: `?`
- Default parameters: `function createPoint(x=0, y=0)`
- Type annotation + default parameters: `function createPoint(x: number = 0)`
- Rest types: `function joinNumbers(...nums: number[])`
- Objects: Are either
  - Records: A fixed amount of properties known at development time.
  - Dictionaries: An arbitrary amount of properties whose names are not known at development time.
- TS's type system: they work structurally, not nominally - meaning they have appropriate structure.
