## Introducing JSX
[Reference](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

- After compilation, JSX become regular JavaScript objects. You can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.
- Curly braces to embed a JS expression in an attribute.
- It can contain children.
- React escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them.
- Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls.
