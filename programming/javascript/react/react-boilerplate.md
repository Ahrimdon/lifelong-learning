Redux Saga

- A saga is like a separate thread in your app that's responsible for side effects. `redux-saga` is a Redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused, and cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, has access to the full Redux app state, and it can dispatch Redux actions as well.
