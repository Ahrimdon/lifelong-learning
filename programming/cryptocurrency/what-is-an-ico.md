- A fundraising mechanism in which new projects sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for bitcoin and ether.
- They can be viewed as unregulated securities that allow founders to raise an unjustified amount of capital, while others argue it's an innovation in the traditional venture-funded model.
- ERC20 token standard: abstracts a lot of the dev process necessary to create a new cryptographic asset.
- Most ICOs work by having investors send funds (usually BTC or ETH) to a smart contract that stores the funds and distributes and equivalent value in the new token at a later point in time.
