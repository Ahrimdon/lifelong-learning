I have a very specific method to be better. One of the best ways is through reading, reading skills. The times when I saw the most multiplicative skills I had was when I read everything: other people's source code. When I come to a bit of code that is foreign, intimidating, and strange, I take the time to read it, analyze it, research it, and forensically unearth why it was done the way it was done. This is yielded the most results. I had to read a number of books, and check out example code. Same with game dev.

I think C++ is overrated in saying that it is faster because it's a bad thing for things such as User Experience which needs to be iterative.

There is also a push back and they say it is a crap language because it's easy to make errors and hard to debug. It's not just the only thing that justifies what a good language is. In game engines I think it is extremely powerful. I think proplr overrate and underrate technologies based on ignorance.
