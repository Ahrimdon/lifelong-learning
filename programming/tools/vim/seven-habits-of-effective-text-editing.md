## Part 1: Edit a File

#### 1. Move around quickly.

Most time is spent reading, checking for errors and looking for the right place to work on, rather than inserting new text or changing it.

Three basic steps:

1. Keep an eye for actions you repeat and/or spend quite a bit of time on.
2. Find if there is an editor commandthat will do this action quicker.
3. Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it without thinking.

Ex: When using C you need to find where a function is defined. You can use the `*` command, but you discover ctags. You learn `C-]` and you save time.

"I want to get the work done, I don't have time to look through the documentation"... horrible way of thinking.

#### 2. Don't type it twice.

If you want to change one word into another, you can use the `:s` substitute command.
