# The Path to Mastery

1. Vim help. Highest ROI. It takes practice to parse it.
2. Keep a cheat sheet on your desk. Vim is a practice of accretion. It means you slowly add parts. Focus on just a few commands at a time. You don't build muscle memory until you do the command. WE DON'T WANT STUFF IN THE CHEAT SHEET, WE WANT THEM IN OUR BRAIN. Undo what you do and use the command and do it the right way.
3. Keep track of your annoyances. When you feel that you are doing something inefficient, capture those in a list. Ex: :Q to quit... few seconds of annoyance is subtracted. We want to stay in the zone and when you have to program in your head, you don't want to stop what you're dong.
4. Learn all the single letter commands. The most important commands are bound to the single letter keys.
5. Bind Esc to Caps Lock.

## The Vim Learning Curve is a Myth

*You can learn to use vim in 30 minutes.* `vimtutor`, and after 30 minutes you can start grasping the ideas that make vim so amazing.

*Learning vim is fun because it's game-like.* _No one ever says "I'd love to learn Street Fighter 2, but there are just so many combos!"_ People don't say this because learning a game is enjoyable. You start off with just the basic kicks and punches, and those get you by. Later, you learn more advanced moves, maybe even by accident.

At first, everything is simple, but then you can chain your commands together. Over time, you burn advanced tricks into your muscle memory.

*You'll be faster than your old editor in two weeks.*
