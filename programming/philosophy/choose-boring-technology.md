[Reference](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)

- Each company gets 3 innovation tokens. Every time you choose something new, you use one of those tokens.
- Boring should not be conflated with "Bad". The nice thing about boringness is that the capabilities, and more importantly, the failure modes, of these things are understood.
- Your function is to map biz problems onto a solution space that involves choices of software. If the choices of software were truly without baggage, you could indeed pick a whole mess of locally-the-best tools for your assortment of problems.
- The problem with "best tool for the job" is the myopic view of the words "best" and "job". The "best"tool is the one that occupies the "least worst" position for as many of your problems as possible.
- Consider how you would solve your immediate problem without adding anything new.
- ***Write down exactly what it is about the current stack that makes solving the problem prohibitively expensive and difficult.***
- Technology for it's own sake is snake oil.
