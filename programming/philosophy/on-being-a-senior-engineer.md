# On Being a Senior Engineer
[link](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)

Web operations is still young, so we can't be surprised when people who have a title of "senior" exhibit immature behavior.

I expect a senior engineer to be a mature engineer.

Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs. "What could I be missing? How will this not work?" They know that nothing they make will ever only be in their hands, and good peer reviews is what makes better decisions.

- ***The degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you'll be in your career as an engineer.***
- Understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived.
- Even if you're really good, it won't matter if no one wants to work with them because they're assholes.
- Part of being happy in engineering comes from enjoying the company of the people you work with.
- Be self-aware re: communication. Find out where you can be better and ask for feedback from peers and managers on how they're doing.
- It's okay to criticize, but criticize the work, not the person. Code is not your baby. Code doesn't have feelings.
- On estimates: figure it out. All businesses rely on estimates.
- On anticipation: look at the code and check if this is a thing that will last for a long time, you have an expectation of CPU/memory/disk/network usage, and other people can understand or study the code.
- You have to be able to do boring things. Do not say that things are beneath you.
- If you can get better at making sure that other people are better, that's awesome. You want people to understand things. "Let's work on this together."
- On trad-offs:
  - Fast written code, or think if you have to change a piece of code at some point.
  - Don't just do random philosophy quotes, know what a premature optimization is or isn't.
  - Know what a right tool for the job is or isn't.
  - You'll know what the trade-offs are when you get better.
- On covering your ass: don't. Do not be the person that throws people under the bus.
- No empty complaints, if you have a complaint, have a suggestion for a solution, and even better is if you have a solution of your own.
- Be aware of your cognitive biases:
  - Self-serving bias: If something is good, it's probably because of me. If it's bad, it's because of someone else.
  - Fundamental attribution error: My bad results = I was tired. Their bad results = they suck.
  - Hindsight bias: "I knew it all along."
  - Outcome bias: If the event was damaging, then the decisions were bad.
  - Planning: being optimistic about forecasting the time a project will take.

## The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming

1. *Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.* The point is to find them early, before they make it to production.
2. *You are not your code.* The entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems will be found.
3. *No matter how much you know, someone will always know more.* Individuals can teach you new moves if you ask.
4. *Don't rewrite code without consultation.* There's a fine line between "fixing code" and "rewriting code". Pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer.
5. *Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.* Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis have the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don't reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.
6. *The only constant in the world is change, be open to it and accept it with a smile.* Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, rather than some serious inconvenience to be fought.
7. *The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.* If you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.
8. *Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.* Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you are right, don't say "I told you so."
9. *Don't be the coder in the corner.* Get involved in conversations, and be a participant in your office community.
10. *Critique code instead of people--be kind to the coder, not to the code.* As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code.

## Novices versus Experts

- Novice: Rigid adherence to rules or plans, little situational perception, no/limited discretionary judgment.
- Advanced beginner: Guidelines for action based on attributes and aspects
- Competent: Conscious/deliberate planning, standardized and routine procedures
- Proficient: Sees situations holistically rather than as aspects, perceives deviations from normal patterns
- Expert: No longer relies on rules, and has an intuitive grasp of situations

*Mature engineers know the importance of (sometimes irrational) feelings people have.*

How people feel about technologies/technical decisions/technical directions is just as important (if not more) than the facts about the details.

*It's amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets credit.*
