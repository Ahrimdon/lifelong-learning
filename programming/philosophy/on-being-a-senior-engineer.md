# On Being a Senior Engineer

Web operations is still young, so we can't be surprised when people who have a title of "senior" exhibit immature behavior.

I expect a senior engineer to be a mature engineer.

Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs. "What could I be missing? How will this not work?" They know that nothing they make will ever only be in their hands, and good peer reviews is what makes better decisions.

*The degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you'll be in your career as an engineer.*

Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived. Mature engineers know that no matter how complete, elegant, or superior their designs are, it won't matter if no one wants to work with them because they are assholes. Condescension, belittling, narcissism, and ego-boosting behavior send the message to other engineers to stay away. Part of being happy in engineering comes from enjoying the company of the people you work with while designing and building things.

Mature engineers have self-awareness when it comes to their communication -- they have some notion about where they could be better, and they continually ask for a gut-check from peers or managers on how they're doing.

They aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive in how they get their ideas across.

There will be assholes, and they should be shunned, but the attitude that someone's code is their baby should come to an end.

Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates, and are always trying to get better at it. *No one should be allowed to avoid estimation issues by saying "I can't give a promise because it depends upon so many uncertain factors."* All businesses rely on estimates.

*Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them.* They recognize that the world's best engineering feats are executed by teams and not by singularly brilliant and lone engineers. Instead of "let me do it for you", do "let's work on this together."

*Mature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and decisions.* We can't be efficient and thorough at the same time. They know that they work within a spectrum of ideal and non-ideal, and it's okay.

Don't say "premature optimization is the root of all evil", understand what "premature" is.

We want to use the right tool for the job, but we don't necessarily need to study all the variations of tools.

## The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming

1. *Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.* The point is to find them early, before they make it to production.
2. *You are not your code.* The entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems will be found.
3. *No matter how much you know, someone will always know more.* Individuals can teach you new moves if you ask.
4. *Don't rewrite code without consultation.* There's a fine line between "fixing code" and "rewriting code". Pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer.
5. *Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.* Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis have the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don't reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.
6. *The only constant in the world is change, be open to it and accept it with a smile.* Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, rather than some serious inconvenience to be fought.
7. *The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.* If you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.
8. *Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.* Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you are right, don't say "I told you so."
9. *Don't be the coder in the corner.* Get involved in conversations, and be a participant in your office community.
10. *Critique code instead of people--be kind to the coder, not to the code.* As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code.

## Novices versus Experts

- Novice: Rigid adherence to rules or plans, little situational perception, no/limited discretionary judgment.
- Advanced beginner: Guidelines for action based on attributes and aspects
- Competent: Conscious/deliberate planning, standardized and routine procedures
- Proficient: Sees situations holistically rather than as aspects, perceives deviations from normal patterns
- Expert: No longer relies on rules, and has an intuitive grasp of situations

*Mature engineers know the importance of (sometimes irrational) feelings people have.*

How people feel about technologies/technical decisions/technical directions is just as important (if not more) than the facts about the details.

*It's amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets credit.*
