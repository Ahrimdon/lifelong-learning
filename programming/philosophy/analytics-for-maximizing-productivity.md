## Work Less, Get More Done: Analytics For Maximizing Productivity
[Reference](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/10/04/work-smarter-not-harder/)

- Working hard is overrated--this is a pernicious social pathology.
- It's just a bad strategy to think that "if my neighbor works X hours, I can work for X + 1 hours". Your competitor can adapt it, and then you're playing a game of multiplayer endurance chicken against everyone else in the market. You can't win but you can certainly all lose, by ending up with an entire community where soul-crushing hours are normative.
- Working harder is also a really bad idea for startups because their resources are, relative to yours, infinite.
- How does "the Industrial Revolution is because of the Protestant Work Ethic" reconcile atheist Japanese salarymen and agnostic Silicon Valley founders?
- A lot of people are emotionally invested in the way they have always done things, so they think that is the proper, morally acceptable way of doing things.
- *It is hard to see who is "working hard" and who is actually doing productive things. The manager sees who is staying late, but the organization doesn't track productivity in any rational, systematic fashion.*
- Web analytics has taught us that our cherished beliefs about web design don’t matter an iota in the face of actual customer behavior.  Customer development has shown us that most of the time we’re spending enormous amounts of resources (including time) on products which will fail for lack of demand.  What is the use in one-upping the competition and spending 83 hours to their 82 when you’re both producing something that no one even wants?
- Good metrics for productivity: selling software. Just assign an arbitrary value for tasks, based on your best guess of how much value they add for the business. Then track how long it takes to complete the tasks, and figure out where you're adding disproportionate amounts of value and where you are just spinning your wheels.
- When in genuine doubt about the value, guess what it would have cost to have somebody else do it for you.

### Pseudo-wage

- Outsourcing: Outsource anything that your personal presence does not add value to. Equivalently, outsource anything where the replacement price is less than your desired pseudo-wage.
- Outsourcing: Has an overhead cost, and payment is due in your time, rather than dollars.
- Ex: writing bingo cards, while I'm good at it, better to outsource it.
- Automate your processes.
  - Software developers should really spend more of their time creating tools for themselves.
  - Japan's rise to global prominence: because of a head-start on process improvement as a science.
  - (It just sounds better to say that Toyota workers work so much harder than GM workers, where in fact they just kaizen the hell out of making a car).
  - He automated the data entry for bingo cards.
- Eliminate unproductive uses of time. `RescueTime`.
  - Think of it like this. If you want to earn $100/hour, if you spend an hour on this thing, is it giving you $100 worth of insights?
  - To kill that habit, I put that number of my admin dashboard for my website.
  - Blogging: 90% of the value from the blog is in far less than 10% of the posts.
  - Shorter articles: about 1 hour to right. Longer ones: about 4. The longer ones vastly produce more traffic, more discussion, more links, and better writing.
  - Lean Startup: Find out which of your development efforts are being 100% wasted because your customers don't want what you're making.
- Think, what tasks actually add value to your business and at what imputed wages.
