## Stupid Recruiter Tricks, Vol. 1: “Where are you interviewing?”
[link](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2015/03/23/srt1/)

Popular question: "Where else are you interviewing?"

Recruiter: "I need to know so I don't send your resume to companies where you are already in play." Candidates: Tell agency recruiters to divulge client names and ask permission before submitting resumes anywhere.

Recruiter: "I need to know if we need to speed things up." If a candidate is involved in the interview process with other companies, it is in the candidate's best interest to inform the recruiter as to how early or late they are in the process. However, the IDENTITIES of the companies competing for a candidate's services are irrelevant unless the recruiter happens to know the typical process.

Motivations:

- Candidate control: recruiter asks questions to slowly get control over the candidate.
- Competitor lists: Where can a firm solicit/poach employees?
- Fishing for new clients: Recruiter will contact the company and insert other candidates into that pipeline.
- Leverage at offer: Recruiter will spread bad rumors about the applicant.

Answer when: Only if the firms you are speaking with have an outstanding employer reputation. This signals that: your skills are in demand by major players, and your skills are on par with high-end talent. Lets the recruiter know that an offer will need to be competitive with what one might expect form top employers.
