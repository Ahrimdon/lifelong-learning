- If you are going to do something on the side, I recommend an enjoyable outdoor hobby that has nothing to do with software. That's the best way to keep refreshed and ready for work.
- Don't work unpaid overtime. Normal people can sustain 60-65 hours if they're enjoying work, but that's about the limit for long-term exertion.
- Build on your own time, learn on the clock when you time. Even if the work has nothing to do with your day job, you can get screwed.
- Don't over-volunteer. It's common that people get loaded up with grunt work because they've developed a reputation for never saying no.
- Always appear busy at work.
- Know you're circadian rhythm. Some amount of self-hacking (melatonin, caffeine) may be in order. When you're working 65 hours a week, you need regularity.
- Exercise, at least half an hour of physical activity per day.
- Make the side project work a habit. The times where you feel drained and shitty, that's when you MUST get something done, because that's when habits are made or broken. Commit to 45 minutes of focused and useful work.
- Carry a book and a notepad at all times, you have to be very efficient with time.
- Know your currency. What's the itch that you're trying to scratch with a side project? Know what you want and what you want to trade for that.
- Know your limits.
- Master your user of time. Remember the things that are urgent (need to be done on a timeline) and there are things that are important (speak to core values).
- Maximize your network. You know people, they know people. Someone, somewhere can help you. Someone, somewhere, is working on something that lines up with things which are important to you. Find them, connect. This doesn't mean screwing off on Facebook or LinkedIn, this mean actually finding specific individuals, meeting with them regularly in person or via Skype/Phone, making plans, moving forward.
- Don't put your family in risk.
- Avoid burnout at all costs.
- Best is to have both benefit each other: your side project might be an open source tool that simplifies some workflow in your main job.
