[Reference](https://m.signalvnoise.com/move-slowly-and-fix-things-e5a560fd928b)

- If you’re designing sticky features that are meant to maximize the time people spend using your product instead of doing something else in their life, is that helpful?
- If you’re trying to desperately inflate the number of people on your platform so you can report corporate growth to your shareholders, is that helpful?
- If your business model depends on using dark patterns or deceptive marketing to con users into clicking on advertising, is that helpful?
- If you’re trying to replace meaningful human culture with automated tech, is that helpful?
- If your business collects and sells personal data about people, is that helpful?
- If your company is striving to dominate an industry by any means necessary, is that helpful?
- Are you even a Designer at all? Or are you a glorified Huckster—a puffed-up propaganda artist with a fancy job title in an open-plan office?
