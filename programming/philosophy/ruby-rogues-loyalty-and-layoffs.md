DAVID: The takeaway from it is that a corporation is just a fiction. It’s a document that exists for a purpose. And if you do not serve that purpose, you have no place there. And the CEO’s job is actually to get rid of you. Or he is incompetent or she is incompetent if they don’t fire you for this. So, being loyal to that corporation is a sickness, it’s a madness and don’t do it. But you absolutely can be loyal.

JAMES:  I guess there’s a couple of points that sounded like that maybe [inaudible]. First is this kind of idea that the company isn’t really on your side. They’re on their side.

JOSH:  I think going into it, it’s sort of an abusive relationship from the start. When you go work for a company, from the very beginning, they don’t pay you what you’re worth. Because if they paid you what you were worth, they wouldn’t be able to make any money off of you. If you were generating some amount of value and they were paying you what that value was worth, there would be no margin on it for them. So, working for somebody else is always something like of an abusive relationship because you’re always doing something that you’re never getting compensated fairly for.

JOSH:  And we talked about this on the episode a couple of weeks ago where sometimes, it’s just really worth taking a lower hourly rate so that the consulting firm can take care of all that business stuff that you don’t want to deal with. And if you go into those situations with your eyes open, I think there’s nothing wrong with being in that kind of business relationship with an employer. But it’s not an even-powered dynamic, "You can walk off the job, we’ll find somebody to replace you." It depends on whether it’s like a buyers’ or sellers’ market. Sometimes if you walk off the job, they can’t find anyone to replace you and then they’re desperate and you have more power. That’s probably like more of a conversation to have a little later about that power dynamic and how that either helps or hurts you depending on which way it’s going.

DAVID: The short answer is that the responsibilities that you place on yourself are perfectly legitimate. They are part of your professional duty. They’re part of your professional behavior. They’re part of your professional character and they are what makes you ‘you’. And if you choose to give that to a company for money, great. As long as you’re choosing to do that, that is absolutely fine.

The moment it becomes dangerous is when you cross this boundary of putting your trust in the corporation and you sacrifice your career. At some point in the future, you’re going to have an exit interview. __And after that point in time, if you have not been investing in your career or in your professional network or in yourself or whatever, if you have sacrificed those investment things prior to that time, you have acted in an irresponsible fashion to yourself.__

CHUCK:  I want to go back a little bit to your talking about profit and value for a minute and mainly just point out that it connects to another point that Dave made and that was that the corporation is kind of this fiction. It’s not a person that can have loyalty toward you. And in a lot of cases, if they’re public companies, the CEO has a fiduciary responsibility to basically maximize profits and increase the stock price. And even if it’s a privately held company, he still has a responsibility to the Board to basically do the same thing.

DAVID:  No. But you’re right. I mean, the company is a machine theoretically, metaphorically. And when somebody leaves, that part falls off the machine, they replace the part and then move on.

DAVID:  I finally wrote a follow-up called Loyalty and Trust in which I went through the definitions of loyalty and trust and vulnerability. And loyalty just means giving or showing firm constant support or allegiance to a person or institution. And that’s good loyalty, you should do that.

"So, if you are working for a company, what should you do loyalty wise?" You should do your job. You should be professionally ethical. __If you can see something is coming down the pipe that is going to destroy the company, you have an obligation to let your manager know that you can see this coming.__ You are an engineer if you are doing some kind of database search and they’re saying, "In order to survive scaling, we have to shard the database." But you know that there’s no way to search across multiple shards without completely reinventing the infrastructure. You have an obligation to let your manager know that your scaling strategy isn’t going to work. "We’re going to go bankrupt if we do this." __You have an ethical obligation to not sit on your butt and watch the clock. You have an ethical obligation to not steal from the company, not embezzle, not do the things that your CEO’s probably doing.__

Go get the certification. You should do that. If your company won’t help you do it, go do it on your own dime. That’s where your loyalty to your own career and your company’s demand for loyalty fall in conflict and when they come in conflict, you should show loyalty to yourself first.
