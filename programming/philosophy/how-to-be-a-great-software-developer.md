# How to be a great software developer

I believe that your seniority and value as a programmer is measured not in what you know, it's measured in what you put out.

Your value is in how you move your project forward and how you empower your team to do the same. I've spent thousands of hours writing and refactoring account management tools, editing suites, caching logic, mailing interfaces, test suites, deployment scripts, Javascript layers, analytics architecture and documentation. These were the things that mattered.

Use MVP for software -- start with something ugly but functional and then apply/reapply yourself to that ugly solution then refactor back to its simplest form.

## Name functions and variables well

`and not` statement is confusing to read--state intent.

## Go deep before you go wide -- learn your chosen stack inside out

Very few programming problems are genuinely new. Very few companies are doing technical work that hasn't already been done by 50 teams before them.

Most programmers waste huge amounts of time by lazily re-creating implementations of pre-existing functionality.

Not only do they waste time but they create verbosity and errors.

## Learn to detect the smell of bad code

Some programmers just don't realize that their code could be better. Learn both what good code looks like and what bad code looks like. Chess grandmasters spend a ton of time studying old chess games, top developers probably do the same thing.

Even code that is "a bit smelly" should be detected. Smells = something that seems simpler, something that feels it should be handled by the language but is manually implemented, or code that is hard to read.

The truth is that the truth is sometimes ugly but you should always strive for beauty and when ugly is the only way, know how to present it well. If you don't know what good code looks like and know what bad code smells like then why would you ever improve it?

## Write code to be read

Stack Exchange optimizes not for the person asking questions but for the person reading the answers, because more people will read the answer rather than ask the question.

## Weigh features on their lifetime cost, not their implementation cost

Build the features you need before the features you want and be VERY careful about architecture.

## Understand the liability and leverage of technical debt

Technical devt is the best debt because you don't have to pay it back. When a product doesn't work, you can drop every optimization/test/refactoring down. So if you don't need them, don't write them.

In the early stages of a product or a feature, the likelihood is that what you are building is wrong, so you might pivot both on product and on technical implementation. You can borrow on technical debt at this point.

Initial code = scouting.

## Check and re-check your code, your problems are yours to fix

Make sure your code works -- it's not the testers' job, and it's not your teammates' job. It's your job.

The truth is you don't need to do that much work to be effective. What really matters is that you do it consistently. Do proper work for at least four solid hours each day, every day, and you will be one of the best contributing members of your team.

This means no e-mail, no HN, no dicking around, and it means staying focused for at least 45 minutes at a time. Software teams don't slow down because people work four pure hours a day rather than 7. They slow down because people spend weeks with no direction.

## Write up the things you've done and share them with the team

Take the time to explain architectural approach and learnings to the rest of the team. Ex: installing stuff and battling bugs.

## Understand and appreciate the balance between too much testing and too little.

Testing is powerful, but it's overhead. Take the time to understand what really needs tests and how to write good tests.

## Make your team better

Does your presence make your team better or worse? Does the quality of your code, your documentation and your technical skills help and improve those around you? Do you inspire and encourage your team-mates to become better developers? Or are you the one that causes the bugs, argues during stand-ups and who wastes hours of time discussing irrelevant architectural nuances because it helps cover the fact that you've done no actual work?

You should make your team better. There should always be at least one or two ways in which you make those people around you better and through which the osmosis of your quality helps strengthen them. However, be aware that being “smart” alone is probably the least valuable and arguably most destructive dimension you can choose. In fact, if your chosen dimension doesn't actually make you tired it's probably not a valid one.

## It's not who are on the inside that defines you.
