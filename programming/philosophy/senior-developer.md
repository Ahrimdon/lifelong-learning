## Ask HN: What makes a Senior Dev
[Reference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11341174)

```
Mistakes, rewrites, late nights, firefights, and deadlines.
Core dumps, memory leaks, hardware faults, and plain bad luck.

Big O, data flow, always learning -- or out you go.

Manager metrics, schedules hectic, methodology hegelian dialectic.

Taking the heat, feature creep, open office, uncomfortable seat.

Holy wars, revolving doors, carpal tunnel, all you can take? There's always more.

Fucking suits, random reboots, and the ever present "thousand language stare".

Oh yeah, pressure -- lots of pressure. And time, time, time.

Metric shitloads of time.

Time, man. You gotta do your fucking time.

- Junior to intermediate: breadth of knowledge. Mid to senior: when not to use them. Focus on delivery.
- Senior: autonomous, they see the impact a decision would have.

## Ask HN: When are you considered a “senior” programmer?
[Reference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12603303)

- Senior developer: produces immediate business value if completely ignored. Intermediate: minimal supervision, but defined goals.
- People who step in and own the project they're given. Someone who can execute. Almost as internal consultants, since they can talk to stakeholders.

# Ask HN: What are the expectations of a principal engineer in your company?
[Reference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25758663)

- Team leader, architect, solver, right hand.
- Peer to high-level people/program managers.
  - The people/project managers are there to make sure that human work proceeds according to plan and have small understanding or concern for nitty gritty technical architecture.
  - In comparison, the PEs have small understanding of the nitty gritty of the human labor management and are there to drive design reviews and act as kind of a veto board for architectural decisions.
- Principal Engineers work on projects that span the entire organisation, usually addressing cross cutting concerns of several teams. They advice Directors and VPs on strategical, mid/long term technical decisions. They set the standards of quality for the org and engage with the community at large. They work on extremely complex and highly ambiguous problems.
- Principal Engineers were more or less strong engineers with the management skills of a Director or VP. That is: strong people skills, project management, program management, leading teams, high business knowledge, strategy, etc. If necessary, they could easily go in and lead an organization of 30-200 people. But they choose to focus on a little bit more engineering/architecture instead of people.
- At both, the common thread is generally that PE's have impact across several teams. Coding is often minimal and typically focused on highly complex / mission critical code or prototyping. Majority of time is spent reviewing / developing architecture. The problems and solutions they tackle become more ambiguous. In many cases, PE's are the ones identifying problems proactively. Often at smaller companies, this role may be more code heavy.

# Staff engineer archetypes
[Reference](https://lethain.com/staff-engineer-archetypes/)

- *The Team Lead guides the approach and execution of a particular team.* Most frequently they partner closely with a single manager, but sometimes they partner with two or three managers within a focused area.
  - They’re comfortable scoping complex tasks, coordinating their team towards solving them, and unblocking them along the way.
  - Earlier in their career they will have implemented their team’s most complex technical projects, but at this point they default to delegating such projects across the team.
  - First, the Team Lead role tends to develop early on within companies that have a strong concept of team, which is common among companies using agile methodologies, and most companies attempt an agile approach at some point.
  - Being a Staff-engineer is not just a role, rather it’s the intersection of the role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization’s recognition of all those things.
- *The Architect is responsible for the direction, quality and approach within a critical area, both today and stretching into the multi-year future horizon.* They combine a deep knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.
  - Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company, for example the company’s API design, frontend stack, storage strategy or cloud infrastructure. For a domain to merit an Architect, it must be both complex and enduringly central to the company’s success.
  - Instead, they dedicated their energy to maintaining an intimate understanding of the business’ needs, their users’ goals, and the relevant technical constraints. They wielded that insight to identify and advocate for effective approaches within their area of focus, leading constellations of teams despite limited tailwinds from bestowed organizational authority.
- *The Solver digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and finds an appropriate path forward.* Some focus on a given area for long periods, others bounce from hotspot to hotspot as guided by organizational leadership.
  - On the other hand, they generally stop working on problems once they’re contained, which can create the feeling of transience, and requires a soft touch to avoid infuriating the teams left behind to maintain the “solved” problem.
- *The Right Hand is a partner and an extension of an executive-level manager, borrowing their scope and authority to operate particularly complex organizations.* They provide additional leadership bandwidth to leaders of large-scale organizations.
  - Folks in this role attend their leader’s staff meetings, and work to scale that leader’s impact by removing important problems from their plate.
  - Right Hands often dive into a fire, edit the approach, and delegate execution to the most appropriate team, and then pop over to the next fire elsewhere in the organization.
