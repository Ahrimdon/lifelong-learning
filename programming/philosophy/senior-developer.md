## Ask HN: What makes a Senior Dev
[Reference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11341174)

```
Mistakes, rewrites, late nights, firefights, and deadlines.
Core dumps, memory leaks, hardware faults, and plain bad luck.

Big O, data flow, always learning -- or out you go.

Manager metrics, schedules hectic, methodology hegelian dialectic.

Taking the heat, feature creep, open office, uncomfortable seat.

Holy wars, revolving doors, carpal tunnel, all you can take? There's always more.

Fucking suits, random reboots, and the ever present "thousand language stare".

Oh yeah, pressure -- lots of pressure. And time, time, time.

Metric shitloads of time.

Time, man. You gotta do your fucking time.

- Junior to intermediate: breadth of knowledge. Mid to senior: when not to use them. Focus on delivery.
- Senior: autonomous, they see the impact a decision would have.

## Ask HN: When are you considered a “senior” programmer?

- Senior developer: produces immediate business value if completely ignored. Intermediate: minimal supervision, but defined goals.
- People who step in and own the project they're given. Someone who can execute. Almost as internal consultants, since they can talk to stakeholders.
