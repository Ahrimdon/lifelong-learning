## FASTER, BETTER, CHEAPER—THE ART OF MAKING SOFTWARE
[Reference](http://jrsinclair.com/articles/2017/faster-better-cheaper-art-of-making-software/)

- No single developer says "I'd like to do a rubbish job today, how can I cost my employer more money?"
- The point of software production: reducing customer pain.
- Ex: it is difficult/painful to learn to code, so there is a market for books and classes that teach programming.
- A business delivers value to customers to the degree that they reduce that customer pain (or perception of it).
- Software product business: Software is the thing we offer to reduce customer pain.
- Other things that add value: sales and marketing. Market research to know if we actually address pain points. UX and graphic design. *In the end, all these activities deliver only plans and promises for customer value. It is software development that turns the plans and promises into a product.*

"It all works better when you embrace the idea that “product,” “design,” and “engineering” are just different perspectives on the same thing."

- Since understanding people is an ongoing activity, we need a software product to change quickly as well, and we need a fast development team.

“The goal of software development is sustainably minimising lead time to business impact.”

- This is why you: pay your developers like kings, buy them super fast computers, and send them to crazy tech conferences they want to attend.
- Developers tend to be natural problem solvers. Good developers like their jobs. They like their jobs because they get to solve interesting complex puzzles all day and get paid for it. So developers should be able to come up with great ideas for becoming more nimble.
- Problem is, organizations encourage developers to focus on the wrong problems.

### Focusing on the Wrong Problems

- This happens when we distance developers from the customers. As soon as a project gets to be any reasonable size, we bring in project managers and business analysts. Which is good, since developers can't do everything, but is also a bit bad, since they become the developers' interface to the world.
- Project managers care about: how much is it going to cost, how long is it going to take, why is it costing so much, why is the project so late, or how much we're burning through each day on this project.
- PMs become focused on predictability. They want plans, structure, estimates. Developers then focus on deadlines, reports, estimates. The problem is estimation and predictability are impossible problems to solve. Every time a developer starts a new task, they face the reality that there might be hidden complexity.

Hofstadter’s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.  - Douglas Hofstadter

- Not meeting an estimate will make the developer work more hard and be tired, then they start making mistakes. Then they cut corners, and ship bugs.
- *Experienced developers know the estimates game is rigged, so they try hard not to play it. The estimate they give is a number that is large enough to sound ridiculous, but also small enough that the project won't be cancelled immediately.*
- With custom software, a great deal of the system is being built from scratch, and usually how it's put together, how it ultimately works, and what exactly it's supposed to do are all moving targets.
- Every time we cut corners, we get behind on the next phase and we have bugs.
- When that happens, developer focus moves away from solving customer pain to things like "how can I not go to this part of the app as much as possible", "how can I mark this feature done and get the PM off my back", "how can I blame someone else", etc.
- *No developer wants to deliver late, buggy software, but we pressure developers to give short estimates because we want it sooner.*
- Acknowledge that going faster requires investment. If things are bad, it needs both a financial/time and an emotional investment.

### Exposing Developers to Customer Pain

- Dogfooding: By turning your developers into users of the product, any glaring bugs or issues will cause pain for the developers too.
- Rotations on support teams.
- Watch people use the software.
- Exposing developers to customer pain is an exercise of deliberate effort to overcome cognitive bias.
- It's dangerous to create an environment where developers have no idea who the users are.

### Ask the Developers

- If you point developers in the right direction, then you can ask them for ideas on how to do that.
- They will think of things like refactoring to make it easier for them to do things quickly.
- Quality software costs money. The developers need to see that we are willing to invest in them and their tools. If there is no budget, then a smart developer will look elsewhere.

### Safety Belts

- TDD, CI, pair programming, code reviews. These are about improving software quality. Catching bugs before release means less re-work, less embarrassment, and happier customers.
- To get things done in a complex environment, you need to make feedback loops shorter and shorter.
