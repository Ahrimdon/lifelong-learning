# RailsConf 2014 - How to be a Better Junior Developer, Katherine Wu
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJW46x27W1w)

Compared to people who have been coding since they were kids, I am literally decades behind. However, something I realized is that being a developer is about constantly learning new things, and I'm really good at that, with picking a new career and starting over and over again.

Also, a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with coding. This means that if you spend a lot of time doing non-CS stuff, you have experience in those aspects. So, while you are learning, you can use your other skills.

I think there are two big reasons why it's hard to be a junior developer. First, there's a ridiculous amount of things to learn. Second, I think it's also really hard to learn how you can help your team, and not just feel like a helpless thing.

## 3-step plan for "so much to learn"

1. *Get people to want to help you.* There are always things that you can do, even if you are isolated. People just aren't fundamentally different, wherever you go. A lot of this boils down to "building relationships", but I prefer to say it as getting to know people, and making friends. I personally find this hard since I am a strong introvert, but the thing is a lot of developers are pretty introverted as well. What I do is to try and pay attention to little details that people have, even about their lives outside of work. I sometimes mentally prepare stories to get conversations going. I'll think of something I did during the weekend, so I have non-generic answers to the question, "how was your weekend"? With a story to tell, this gets the back and forth going.

I also think that if your company has a support team, you should make friends there. They know a lot about the product.

*Show you did your homework.* You want to make sure that you are not wasting their time. You want to make sure that you researched and learned some tactics before asking them. You can also ask them, "if you're busy, who else could I talk to about this?". When someone does help you, you could ask them, "is there somewhere I could've found this answer on my own?", and if there isn't, make one.

*Show your appreciation.* Making sure that people get noticed when they help you encourages more of that. Let people's managers know. Most people like having managers know that they did something good.

2. *Make it easy for them to help.* I think one of the hardest parts of learning is letting people see inside your head. You can say things like "you had me until this point" or "I'm confused, because I thought you said this, and this, but...". A good format is "I'm trying to do \_, so that I can \_. I'm running into \_. I've looked at \_ and tried \_. Also, describe what you've done already.

Remember that just having the courage to say, "I don't know" is a strength. Exposing your ignorance is sort of scary, so I am always practicing things like "wait, I don't even actually know what that word means" all the time. The sooner I tell people that I don't know what's going on, the sooner I can get to actually learning, and working.

Of all the advice I got when I started at New Relic, this one is my favorite: "Sometimes things are confusing not because you're new, but because they're confusing." One of the best things that mentors can do when junior developers can do is just validating that feeling, being honest and saying that "this is confusing for me too." Then, it becomes a team effort to get out of the ignorance together. You can also get to know debugging techniques which you can use next time.

Give specific, positive reinforcement. My favorite feedback that I get from people is usually people telling me that they actually used any advice that I gave them, so when you tell people specifically what it is that they did that helped you, they know what they can do more. "It really helped me when you walked me through..."

We have this idea of "failing fast", but it's hard to apply it when you don't feel secure. What helped me was when mentors told me of what happened when they messed things up, and the idea that "It's not a matter of if you break production, but when". Your team should have processes in place to make it easier to recover quickly, and we should try to remember these processes so it won't happen again, because if just one person can ruin everything, then that's a problem for the whole team.

It's also nice to tell someone when you can interrupt him at any time. If, as a mentor, as a philosophy is to let people struggle, then it's nice to tell them that that is what you want to do.

3. *Narrow the scope.* Mentors are helpful here, because they can help prioritize what to do next.

## 3-step plan for "helping you team"

Even my ignorance can help other people because they can practice things like mentoring. Your technical contributions are still important. Yes, even though you are slower, it's not a choice of having it built quickly by a senior vs having it built slowly by a junior, most of the time it is a choice of having it built or not at all. Don't compare your beginner to someone else's middle. No one comes out of their mama's womb knowing how to code.

1. *Ask good questions.* I think that questions are the junior developer's superpower. Questions like, "are we working on the right thing", and "is there a reason we're doing it this way". Of course, don't ask questions that put people on the defensive.

2 *Give good feedback.* This is very hard. Speak up when you have good things to say. I hope this builds up the reputation that I'm a positive person, and that the negative feedback I have will be taken more seriously. Sometimes, good feedback is "I don't have an opinion on this topic."

3. *Make your team look good.* Give awesome demos: You can give awesome demos just by being thoughtful and prepared. You can then show them the before/after. They are a good time to give credit to the team for the things that you've done. I like to overprepare, so I always write a script of what I want to show, in a particular order In general, making an effort to be responsive, thorough, & empathetic really goes a long way.

## Pitfalls to avoid

Undervaluing non-technical skills. A lot of what I've been talking about is to use your non-technical skills to help your tech move forward. The things is, you just don't want to be assumed to be some kind of a secretary (no offense to secretaries).
