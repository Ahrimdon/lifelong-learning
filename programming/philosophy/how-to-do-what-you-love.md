# How to Do What You Love & Earn What You’re Worth as a Programmer
[link](https://leanpub.com/dowhatyoulove/read)

University isn't about communication, teamwork, or project management. If you happen to learn those things, that's a bonus. To paraphrase Eric Beck, “At either end of the educational spectrum there lies a hacker class.” And we are not interested in hackers, even great hackers. We need those middle of the spectrum folks who are going to live in the suburbs, commute to our offices, and do a decent job for a fair wage week after week, year after year.

Quite honestly, the very fact that you passed on University tells us something disturbing about you. Quite obviously you aren't stupid. And you knew that people like us would have a problem with your lack of education. But you believed in your heart of hearts that you could make up for this with excellence.

Like hazing rituals and wearing dark suits to work in August, attending a certain kind of University is a statement that you want to belong, that you know there is no practical purpose to the exercise but that you are prepared to make the sacrifice just to fit in. And you, dear applicant, would not fit in.

It's not you, it's us. The plain fact is, you wouldn't be happy here. So buck up, look around, and see if you can get yourself into something a little more early stage. Consider starting your own company.

## No Disrespect

I hear an argument that business programming isn't hard. It does not require understanding combinatorial logic and fixed points. There is no value in knowing how to program in OCaml (or why that might be a good idea). Business programming is practical, and business programmers need practical training to do a practical job.

There is a culture of pretending business programming is more than it is. Some of you calling for more Java in University may take false hope that I am on your side. You may think that the people arguing for Scheme, Haskell, and OCaml are elitists. Wrong. They do not have a problem. You are the one with a problem because you don't want to tell all your friends you have a job as a clerk.

If a Computer Science degree was really meant to give you an advantage in a business environment, it would involve a lot more writing English than writing Java. You would know that if you went on to get an MBA.

Let me tell you, and I speak as a hiring manager. We lie to you. We write in articles and books and on blogs how much we value a degree. Joel Spolsky argues that there ought to be good degrees. But I will bet anyone $100 that he will hire a high school graduate if that graduate is smart and can get things done.

Beyond your actual ability to write programs, a degree is only as meaningful as its scarcity. If degrees are easy to get, they mean squat. Sure, when I'm hiring I might choose to toss all the no-experience resumes without degrees. I'm still left with a pile of two hundred people to interview. Do you think I'm paying any of you top dollar when I have 199 more people to see?

*The reality is that your degree is only a pacifier, a way to make you feel good about yourself. The industry is selling you the illusion of respect.*

You can be respected for your job. But it has nothing to do with whether we pretend a university degree is required for the position. Everybody knows it isn't: if it was, there would be no need to dumb down the program to suit the job. Respect comes from what you accomplish, and where programs are involved, it comes from writing programs, not from a title or a piece of a paper (nor from a book or a blog). Nobody on Earth can stop you from writing software and earning genuine respect.

## Interlude: You and Your Research

In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do first-class work.’’ Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You’re not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that’s a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn’t you set out to do something significant. You don’t have to tell other people, but shouldn’t you say to yourself, “Yes, I would like to do something significant.’’

Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had worked with one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our secretary at the time. I went over and said, “Do you mind if I join you?’’ They can’t say no, so I started eating with them for a while. And I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?’’ And after a week or so, “What important problems are you working on?’’ And after some more time I came in one day and said, “If what you are doing is not important, and if you don’t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?’’ I wasn’t welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! That was in the spring.

## How to get your first job developing software

In my experience, good developers love to write code. In fact, the very best developers don’t know how to “not write code”. When they were in high school, they wrote MUDs in Basic (well, that’s what they did in the 80s). When they were in college, they developed Perl and Tcl scripts that scanned Usenet for updates to threads of interest. Even if they hold a “lowly” summer job working in a computer store, they have a Linux system at home running Apache and mod_perl or PHP.

Even after they get paying jobs working 70 hours a week, good developers can’t stop coding. For example, Phil Greenspun started Ars Digita, yet he wrote lots of free tools on his home server (I use two of them on my own weblog). Paul Graham ran Franz and Viaweb (now Yahoo! Stores), yet he is busy developing a new language, Arc. In my own case, I was busy as a consultant in the early nineties but couldn’t help writing a PDA application and a dynamic web service “on the side”.

When I am asked how an inexperienced person can get their foot in the door, I give two pieces of advice:

First, I tell them to just start writing code. If they don’t know what to write, I don’t suggest anything specific, I just tell them that they should pick stuff they enjoy, using tools they like. It isn’t important to use the latest “industry standard” tools or work on something “commercial”.

Second, I tell them to think in terms of a “portfolio” instead of a “résumé”. Even if they don’t take a physical portfolio to job interviews, their résumé or cover letter should include an appendix with samples of their work. If an inexperienced person wants to stand out from the crowd, screen shots, links, and code snippets will appeal to a technical hiring manager.

Is any of this guaranteed? No. Some companies hire HR people that are not qualified to tell the difference between a talented candidate who compiles and builds their own development environment at home and a mediocre college graduate that didn’t expand their own horizons.

I personally wouldn’t want to work for a company that gives significant authority over its intellectual property to such an HR person, but not everyone is as picky as I am :-)

## The single most important thing you must do to improve your programming career

*The single most important thing you must do to improve your programming career is improve your ability to communicate.*

To program, you must elicit ideas from other people and share your ideas with them. Sharing ideas comes in many forms: explaining how you did something. Suggesting a new practice for the team. Demonstrating how something works. Convincing everyone to switch programming languages. Persuading a brilliant engineer to join your team. Persuading your manager to get out of the way and let you do your thing.

Advancing your career is entirely about communicating. Getting a job. Turning down a job. Asking for a promotion. Turning down a promotion. Getting onto a good team. Politely extricating yourself from a good team. Persuading a brilliant engineer to co-found a company. Helping a brilliant engineer understand why co-founding a company isn’t the right thing to do. Asking for funding. Turning down funding. Getting clients. Turning down clients.

It’s all communication. Now you know, I have a background in Sales and Marketing. So I worry that I am holding a Golden Hammer and suggesting to you that your career is all about nailing things. But here is the short and obvious truth: Human beings are all about physical communication. It’s a huge, huge part of what makes us human, this talking and listening jibber-jabbering thing.

Frankly, there is no substitute for actual speech with visible body language. We do not react to the written word the same way that we react to a speech where we can see the speaker. So let’s skip right past learning to write well. It’s phenomenally important, but learning to speak well trumps everything. Where I work, we talk about technical things all the time, and the remote members of the team switch out of Campfire into iChat or Skype to hear each other’s voices and see each other’s faces at least once a day.

If you take just one thing from this post, let it be this: To improve your programming career, the single most important thing you must do is improve your ability to communicate your ideas face to face.

Here is what to do today to shorten the line between where you are and where you need to be: Volunteer to give a presentation that you can entirely control, and invest the time and effort to do the best possible job.

## The Mother of All Interview Questions

*Does your process involve invention? If so, please describe the three most recent things you have invented and why it was necessary to invent something new.*

The results are really easy to interpret. Does your team invent new things in the course of its work? If so, what are you to make of a candidate who doesn't invent new things and believes that software should be built by integrating tried and true existing components? Such a candidate is not wrong, but are they a good fit?

Even if you invent and the candidate invents, discussing their inventions drives directly to the core of what kind of developer they are. Are their inventions part of the core value proposition of the software they develop? Are their inventions focused on developer productivity but invisible to users and stakeholders? Do they prefer novelty to reliability?

Such developers have realized that if you never invent, your code cannot be better than anybody else's. This might be fine for some internal HR workflow management application, but when building anything that is part of their employer's core value proposition, you cannot add great, disruptive value without being prepared to take the road less traveled somewhere in the code base.

I will not suggest that one or the other approach is the best way forward. I think that for each person, there is a natural affinity to invention or a natural dislike of the risks and time sinks involved. Some people feel deeply rewarded giving birth to something new after a long, arduous period of research, trial and error. These developers can often be insanely smart.
