What's the core reason to why you are at a conference, as opposed to reading blogs and listening to podcasts?

Welcome, because Ruby is awesome. The stated goal of Ruby is to "increase developer happiness." And that's got to be the greatest thing.

Regional Conferences: Talks are there to give topics of conversation. The hallway tracks are really the core. They are the core value of a conference. So conferences are about *meeting people*.

Check the table: Are these people people you know? Understand that this introversion, the "I want to be only around people I know", we usually equate this as shyness. But we can break out of that.

"Am I smiling enough? Should I be leaning? Where should my hands go? Bla bla bla" You don't have to be shy. Tenderlove just says, "don't be shy." Push out any feeling that you can't go talk to any people.

Challenge for you: *Meet 10 people.* You're never going to be in a room where everyone is going to be equally as nerdy as you. _Talk to people. It may be awkward, but keep trying. Only 1 person you meet has to be awesome to be worth it._

Meeting people: Have lunch with a new group, listen for dinner activities. And NEVER EVER EVER EVER eat alone.

Conferences are reunions. You'll see the same people.
