## 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know

- ***Act with Prudence.*** Choose to do right rather than do quick.
- ***Apply functional programming principles.*** Referential transparency: implying that functions always return the same results (clone). Usually better responsibility allocation with smaller functions that act on arguments, rather than mutating variables.
- ***Ask, what would the user do?***
- ***Automate your coding standard.*** Code formatting, code analysis, test coverage.
- ***Beauty is in simplicity.*** Read a lot of other people's code.
- ***Before you refactor.***
  - Avoid the temptation to rewrite everything, the existing code has already been tested, reviewed.
  - New tech is an insufficient reason to refactor, there should be a cost-benefit analysis.
- ***Beware the Share.*** When thinking if you need to share things, think of their contexts first.
- ***The Boy Scout Rule.*** Always check a module in cleaner than when you found it, regardless of who the author was. Care for the team's code.
- ***Check your code first before looking to blame others.*** If I can't pin down a bug, possibly stack corruption. Multithreaded code also makes it important that you do simple shit.
- ***Choose your tools with care.*** Only the tools that are absolutely necessary.
- ***Code in the language of the domain.***
  - `traderCanView(portfolio)`, not `portfolioById...`
- ***Code is design.***
- ***Code layout matters.*** Easier to scan (pattern matching).
- ***Code reviews.***
- ***Coding with reason.*** At each endpoint, the state of the program satisfies an easily described property, and so that the functionality of that section is easy to describe as a single task.
  - No goto, no modifiable state variables.
  - Nested section: function.
- ***A comment on comments.***
- ***Comment only what the code cannot say.***
- ***Continuous learning.***
  - Hands-on code.
  - Virtual mentor.
  - Get to know frameworks.
  - Fixing a bug = understand what really happened.
  - Teach or speak about the things you learned about.
  - Learn a new language every year, or at least a new technology or tool.
- ***Distinguish business exceptions from technical.*** These should have different hierarchies.
- ***Do lots of deliberate practice.***
  - 20 hours per week for 10 years.
