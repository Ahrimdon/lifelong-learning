# GoGaRuCo 2013 - Built to Program by James Edward Gray

In this wheelchair, I can't really type. I can't do live coding.

I answer questions about my disability in the same way that you normally ask people why they have a band-aid.

I have muscular dystrophy (spinal muscular atrophy). Basically the short story of my disease is I get weaker over time. My heart is fine, but the problem is my diaphragm, because it's a skeletal muscle.

I can't move because I have an arch-enemy, gravity. I have a weakened heat regulator muscle thing. The problem is things like layered jackets feel like a straitjacket.

We have different building blocks, but we come together in this city to talk about Ruby. Having MD does a ton of things to me, large and small. So the first one is that as I've gotten weaker over time, I'm slowing down. In the last 2-3 years, my typing speed has gone in half. I have been forced to automate workflows so I can keep up. I feel like this helps me intimately understand of workflows and things like that. I'm trying to stop things at a character level. I'd rather that I have an automation to create a class for me faster than typing C-L-A-S-S.

If you have a disability where you have a fixed amount of energy. You have a certain amount of actions per day. This is a big thing for me, as a programmer. I have an understanding of this economy of action.

I have to do "listen first". I have to understand what we're talking about. Then I think it through. Then, I act. Less of more. If there is a process that I can do with less actions, then that is what I will do. If you have a lot of energy, you disregard upkeep costs. But I have a keen sense of what upkeep costs.

I understand asking for help. Some of you are good at asking for help, but I'm at a whole different level from where you are.

I'm becoming less and less interested with what individual programmers can accomplish. There are a lot of rabbit holes underneath. We can only accomplish so much. So get social.

Learning to program, that's an easy part. Learning to be a programmer, that's the hard part.
