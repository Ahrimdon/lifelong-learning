1. *Have a blog.* The most important thing is the name. Make sure it's something people will remember. Don't make it too Railsy. Make it your own. Don't use a default blog template. If the content is good enough, maybe they will visit etc. But if the personality is good, they will remember. Some people get hooked to stuff, some need about 3-4 good posts.

The idea is association. So spend time on the design, either with a friend or something. Don't put a list of blogs on the sidebar. I keep the sidebar very sparse. No tag clouds, etc. Put your E-mail address, too. Don't join Google ads.

Header: A picture of you. People need to recognize that you are you. For tone, pick 10 Rails developers you want and get their tone.

Make a rule for the blog. The rules establish consistency. Every day you need to write a post. What to post, anything. Check the techniques of the other bloggers. After a few weeks, what do you do?

Twitter: Make it match your blog. Make sure your backgrounds exist. Your tweets too are important. Do posts early on Reddit at a weekday. To get eyeballs, show people the problem, the solution, and tell them how to install it and to download it. As far as thinking of code, just put them down. Keep things simple and write a blog post to rinse and repeat.

If something is causing you pain, most probably, other people have pain, too. People want something interesting to read. Remember the 10 Rails blogs that you like. Leave comments, etc.

The problem with being a famous Rails developer is you can become that without being a good Rails developer. I'd rather want to be a good Rails developer.

Code is what brings developers together. It's not blogging or trolling or procrastinating, it's reading code.

Before, in PHP, no version control, no constants (magic numbers). I made a YAML parser thing.

Github caught on because it's about code. Sourceforge is not about code. They should cut down their registration page, no approval process, allow you to change the stuff there. 

When starting a biz, you want an accounting person and a business person because their $100/hour is less expensive than your rate. So as a dev, you want to find your pain points and remove them. Git branching, Rails, tests. Let's stop arguing about languages and testing frameworks and just make sites that can help people. Let's focus more on code and less on talk. More on community and less about ourselves.

Sites like RubyFlow and Twitter make it easy to find other people. Do we want to be rock stars or douches? I think I'd rather want tot be a good developer.

The inspiration for Github is the coding. Lots of stuff were in the way in sharing code.

I don't do more than anyone else, I just talk a lot and share a lot. Github is really more about users and you see faces of people. There are profiles and friends. It's like Facebook, where you can see their photos, but here you can see the person's code. You have your identity linked to code and you are judged based on that.
