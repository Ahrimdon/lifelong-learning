[Reference](https://snipcart.com/blog/guide-developer-productivity-tools)

- Strict schedule: When are you most productive, and in what locations are you productive then? Your peak hours may not be the same as your peers'.
  - If you don't know, experiment/iterate. Then, fill the rest of your free time with activities you enjoy doing.
  - Identify clear to-dos.
- Write intelligible, easily testable code.
  - TDD, component mocking/fake data, focus on very few code components at a time. CI, test frameworks.
- Reduce distractions.
  - Use Do Not Disturb mode on Slack for periods of deep focus.
  - Always use DMs for 1-1 conversations.
  - Encourage peers to stay on topic in dedicated channels.
  - Async communications.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. Google, StackOverflow, Github issues, Slack, comments in project management tools.
- Take care of your mental health.
  - Overtime, missed deadlines, in-production bugs, angry clients, arguments, world news, personal issues, conspiracy theories.
  - Exercise, eat well/drink water always, sleep well.
- Strive for overall balance.
  - Anxiety/frustration: meditation, growth mindset, stoicism.

# A guide to productivity for software engineers

- When your work is more ambiguous, complex, and more unbounded, you'll find yourself procrastinating. You'll feel more overwhelmed.
- Your days become meetings, specs, researching new tech, writing docs. Less of the work seems "fun".
- Productivity is not about doing more, it's about "what have I accomplished today"?
- What to do?
  - Choose my focus. What do I enjoy working on?
  - Learning, coding features, making architectural improvements, improving processes, growing influence.
  - Do I enjoy this? Does this help me/my career?
  - Does this help my team and the company?
- *Discomfort very frequently means growth.* Once I have my areas of focus, I'll use them as the filter throughout the month or quarter for any work coming my way.
- Get things done: Choosing the big rocks for the week and the most important tasks for the day. You want to accomplish big rocks instead of tiny pebbles.
- Focused (no Slack) vs reactive time.
- Analyze and iterate.
