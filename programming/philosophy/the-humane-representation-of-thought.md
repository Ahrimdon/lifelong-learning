## The Humane Representation on Thought
[link](http://vimeo.com/115154289)

- Author guides reader through dynamic models.
- Creative tool environments for mathematical systems/representation of the behavior for the authors (how can they know what exactly they are doing).
- What are all of the prototypes trying to solve?

#### Representations

- Representations, the ways we externalize thought, over the past 2000 years, have been responsible for the large intellectual growth of humanity.
- These media, while empowering us in some ways, also cripple us in some ways.
- Representation = physical form of a thought, we can manipulate it with the body.
- Playfair in 1700-ish: There is a different way for us to understand numbers and a different way for maps. Instead of normal maps, he made graphs of stuff. Today, the data plot underlies science and engineering.
- Human beings have a certain capability for understanding maps and cartographic abstraction. These were not being used when we were trying to understand data. Representations draw on the certain innate capabilities that we have and they bring these capabilities into service.
- Representations: Hindu-Arabic numerals, you can't arithmetic in Roman Numerals. Place value in HA numerals were the first user interface to do calculations on paper. Same for algebra/notation/etc., these are UIs, Periodic table, Bohr's model of the atom, Faraday's model of magnetism, Maxwell's equations...

#### Media

- *When you think about the great ideas of history, you often want to think about the representations that enabled people to have those ideas. Ideas live in representations and these representations live in medium.*
- The invention of powerful media to show powerful representations is a driver of humanity. These allow us to understand the world better.
- While we have improved in many ways, every technology is a double edged sword. With representations, they draw on our capabilities, and so the capabilities that are not supported in media, such as print, they undergo atrophy.
- Our work has now become paper-based and eventually computer-based. "Knowledge work" is now sitting and working with symbols in a tiny rectangle. You almost can't separate the representation from the way that it is.

#### Inhumane/Modes of Understanding

- *I will make the claim that this style of knowledge work is inhumane.*
- We agree that it's wrong to trap your pet puppy in a cage. Why? We kind of have a notion of what it is to live a doggy life (freedom, going around, etc.) We recognize that a dog has its capabilities and by sticking it inside a cage, you restrict it. This is essentially what we've done to ourselves, we have media that constrain our experiences, and we are not allowed to use our full intellect.
- Modes of understanding: Visual, aural, tactile, kinesthetic, spatial. For music, visual = sheet music, tactile = guitar, kinesthetic = dancing, spatial = distributing instruments in an orchestra. Music is just one thing, any number of objects have multiple representations.
- Jerome Bruner: Enactive/iconic/symbolic. Enactive - you ride a bike. Iconic - seeing the bike. Symbolic - talk about parts of the bike. Speech is symbolic, and writing turns speech into iconic (stuff on paper).
- The space that we understand things is so diverse that when people try to make a theory about it, no two theories are the same.
- With the invention of the printing press/computer, we are left with *visual/symbolic.* We're left with visual symbols, reading and manipulating them, this is our knowledge work. At least a book has tactile (holding the book) and spatial (put them in the shelf), for computers there is none.
- This is inhumane since we restrict ourselves. This is wasteful in that it's like you're just using one core out of eight/you aren't parallelizing the brainpower.

#### Dynamic Medium

- *Computational, responsive (to stimuli), connected (books are isolated, dynamic material can talk to each other).*
- In language, you can talk about it. For computational, you can model/explore the system.
- Ideally connected means that you don't need the tiny screens, you can do it with stuff the size of a room.
- Person to person interaction: Conversing, presenting.
- Thing to person: Reading, browsing.
- Person to thing: Writing, thinking.
- Future prediction of computers (Sussman): It will be so small that you can have some sort of material that you can build stuff with. The technology that Sussman is talking about will come (we can plan for it) or we can just jump on technology bandwagon (won't recommend this).
- *Conversing.* Spoken words going back and forth/body movement/draw stuff. What is not well represented in spoken language are systems. Biological systems/stuff that we make such as political/electronics systems. The wrong way to talk about a system is to describe it. The right way is to get in it and model it and explore it. You can't do that in words. People are explaining in the old tools such as rhetoric as opposed to using the new tools such as models.
- We want a medium that is show and tell, where you can depict non-static images, models. So how, do we do this, since at this moment we just use programming to build these types of things, but they take a lot of time. (Or they take a lot of time because we are thinking in the context of bashing stuff on the keyboard.) We just need the right medium, and maybe we can do this proposed activity in real-time. BTW this is not Google Docs. That's about using the old methods/static stuff and moving it around faster. I'm talking about pushing words to the sideline and dynamic modelling.
- *Presenting.* Instead of Powerpoint, we can have this dynamic thingie too. Instead of trusting, we can just show models. Trusting authority is actually disempowering, actually just showing the point is better. If we have a dynamic material, we can have some kind of dynamic stage where props are downloaded. We are able to map mental space to physical space.
- *Reading.* Books and websites are basically big piles of words, maybe we can have dynamic reading? Context-sensitive material, where what I read and what you read might not be the same thing. In the same way that game engine makers get surprised by what game designers are able to do, maybe authors will be surprised with what their readers can do. Form factor - I think it might be not like what a book looks like to day, but more like a museum. If we want to learn linear algebra, you "download" the book and you use your spatial form of perception. This is not VR/AR, this is just R, in that you are actually able to see things, much like what you see when you see stuff on the computer.
- So I've been thinking of knowledge not as words, but as programs. So what does authorship look like? *Writing.* The closest activity we have right now is programming. I think programming is engineering and authoring. Engineering is thing to thing, authoring is person to person. Engineering is making the thing to meet a spec, and authoring is to create an impression onto someone else. These are two different things. Engineering, we can use code, but authoring, I don't think code can help with that.
- *Creating new knowledge.* How would you use dynamic material to represent your own thought process? What is the stuff that we'll use to think with? There's a representation that you want to hold in your hand (objects), and there's some representations that you want to explore from the inside (environments). Well, most of the intellectual work we do is flat-paper of pixels on a screen. We used to have architectural models/molecular models, which are becoming extinct because of virtualization. These are weaker in terms of you can't hold it, but dynamic behavior trumps all. Currently, just putting it on a screen is the only way we know how to do dynamic.
- Environments - since they are static, they cannot respond to things at the speed of thought. Right now, everything has to be within arm's reach (hence the desk), but in the future we can just move around the environment. We'd want to work in a way that empowers the body (BTW Fitbit is not a solution).

Humane just won't happen. Humane is never a default. It will come out of deliberate and conscientious design work. If you believe in the possibility of humane medium, then it's up to us to make it happen.
