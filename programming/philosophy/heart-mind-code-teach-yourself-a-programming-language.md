## Teach Yourself a New Programming Language in 21 Minutes (Or 2-3 Years, It Depends)
[Link](http://heartmindcode.com/2013/06/18/teach-yourself-a-new-programming-language-in-21-minutes-or-2-3-years-it-depends/)

All you need to do to learn a new language is learn:

- How the language encapsulates data
- When the language invokes execution of code
- Where to the semicolons and braces go

#### Don’t Stop There if You Can’t Stop There

As you’re learning the new programming language, ask yourself the two vital tradeoff questions:

- Do I really want to learn this language bad enough to actually learn this language?
- Can I afford the time and energy needed to fumble around being bad at this language?

Bash is just not worth learning to me, so I keep some files around with examples of the most obvious kinds of things I want to do, and when I need a new bash script–usually about twice a year–I have all the pieces I need right there.

#### Truly Embracing A Language Takes Time, But You’re In A Hurry, So

If you want to embrace a language, it’s going to take time. You’re going to have to internalize the language’s entire approach to solving problems. You’re going to have to learn its idiosyncracies and its warts, and you’re going to have to learn its power moves and elegant applications.

I’m writing this assuming you already know a programming language or three or seven. The good news is, the more languages you know, the faster you can recognize the basic syntax patterns and logic structures of a new language. But the bad news is: the more languages you know, the more they tend to blur into a common model of computation in your head. This can make you blind to the elegant weirdnesses of your new language. 

Resist the urge to judge weird things quickly; they often turn out to be the most powerful features of the language once you “go native”. If you see something you can’t stand, remind yourself that you haven’t seen everything there is to see, and give the new idiom a chance. Try it out and learn its tradeoffs. It’s okay to discard a bad idea in JavaScript once you understand why it’s a bad idea in JavaScript… but __it’s never a good idea to discard a feature of a new language based on your instincts–because your instincts come from other languages, not this one.__

#### TL;DR This Is Mostly About Your Blind Spots

- Listen hard for hints and clues from its culture. Ruby: Blocks, naming. Python: List comprehensions. JS: Functions and their prototypes.
- Be ready for new ways of thinking. Be alert to the pain of trying to write OO in JS when JS's prototype system is different from OOP-based inheritance.
- Learn the minefields. Ruby is a memory hog. All numbers in JS are floats (no integers).

So here’s the hard part: Last of all, learn the idioms. From here on out it’s all about learning to think in the language. That’s going to take you a bit longer, and there’s nothing for it but to talk to other programmers, find some online references, maybe buy a cookbook… but mostly, it’s going to take writing code. Lots and lots of code. In my experience (both personal and observing coworkers and clients) this last part’s a doozy–plan on it taking a couple years or more.
