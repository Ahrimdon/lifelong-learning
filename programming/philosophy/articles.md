- Developers are self-motivated people.

- Solutions: flexible schedule, home office.

## Comments

- *Trust is requirement #1 for this job (software development).*
- Solo work without distractions, one-on-one collaboration, group collaboration, collaboration with stakeholders, space to get out of your head, etc. Mechanics, chefs, carpenters, etc. work in places designed for and dedicated to their type of work. So should developers.

- Signaling: When you look for a job, you signal your ability to employers via a resume with a list of your educational qualifications and work history.
- Capable: If they think they are more capable than their employers.
- Better pay.
- Less predictable pay.
- Smarter.
- Immigrants/funding: harder to show their credibility to existing companies.
- ***Asymmetric information about ability leads existing companies to employ only "lemons," relatively unproductive workers. The talented and more productive choose entrepreneurship.***
