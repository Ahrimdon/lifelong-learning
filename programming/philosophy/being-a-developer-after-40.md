## Being A Developer After 40
[Reference](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/being-a-developer-after-40-3c5dd112210c)

- *Forget the hype.* CORBA/RUP, SOAP/XML, Model Driven Architecture/Software Factories, Semantic Web, Augmented Reality, Big Data, Virtual Reality.
  - Keep doing your thing, keep learning what you were learning, and move on. Pay attention to it only if you have a genuine interest, or if you feel that it could bring you some benefit in the medium or long run.
- *Choose your Galaxy Wisely.*
  - Examples of galaxies are, for example, .NET, Cocoa, Node.js, PHP, Emacs, SAP, etc. Each of these features evangelists, developers, bloggers, podcasts, conferences, books, training courses, consulting services, and inclusion problems.
- *Learn About Software History.*
  - Apply the same recipe to any language or CPU architecture that you enjoy or love: Python, Ruby, Java, whatever the programming language; learn their origins, how they came up to be. The same for operating systems, networking technologies, hardware, anything. Go and learn how people came up with those ideas, and how long they took to grow and mature. Because good software takes ten years, you know.
  - You will also learn to value those things that stood the test of time: Lisp, TeX, Unix, bash, C, Cocoa, Emacs, Vim, Python, ARM, GNU make, man pages.
- *Keep on Learning.*
  - Learn. Anything will do. Wanna learn Fortran? Go for it. Find Erlang interesting? Excellent. Think COBOL might be the next big thing in your career? Fantastic. Need to know more about Functional Reactive Programming? Be my guest. Design? Of course. UX? You must. Poetry? You should.
  - Tip 1: learn at least one new programming language every year. I did not come up with this idea; The Pragmatic Programmer book did. And it works.
  - Look at it this way: if you are now 20 years old, by the age of 30 you will have read over 60 books, and over 120 when you reach my age. And you will have played with at least 20 different programming languages. Think about it for a second.
  - If I could go back in time and tell the younger me exactly one and only one thing, it would be "learn UNIX".
- *Teach.*
  - It might mean that you give meaningful answers to questions in Stack Overflow; that you write a book; that you publish a podcast about your favorite technology; that you keep a blog; that you write on Medium; that you go to another continent and set up programming schools using Raspberry Pis; or that you help a younger developer by becoming their mentor (do not do this before the age of 30, though.)
  - Teaching will make you more humble, because it will painfully show you how limited your knowledge is. Teaching is the best way to learn. Only by testing your knowledge against others are you going to learn properly. This will also make you more respectful regarding other developers and other technologies; every language, no matter how humble or arcane, has its place within the Tao of Programming, and only through teaching will you be able to feel it.
- *Workplaces Suck.*
  - This means that you are solely responsible for the success of your career.
  - Do not take a job just for the money. Software companies have become sweatshops where you are supposed to justify your absurdly high salary with insane hours and unreasonable expectations.
  - It does not matter that you are Zach Holman and that you can claim in your CV that you literally wrote Github from scratch: you will be fired for the pettiest of reasons.
  - It does not matter that the app brings more than half of your employer traffic and revenues; the API team will treat you and your ideas with contempt and sloppiness.
  - I have been asked to work for free by very well known people in the industry, some of them even featured in Wikipedia, and it is simply appalling. I will not give out their names, but I will prevent any junior from getting close to them, because people working without ethics do not deserve anyone’s brain.
  - And to top it all, they will put you in an open space, and for some reason they will be proud about it. Open spaces are a cancer. They are without a doubt the worst possible office layout ever invented, and the least appropriate for software development — or any type of brain work for that matter.
- *Know Your Worth.*
  - It works, however, from the point of view of the employer: a “10x Software Engineer” generates worth 10 times whatever the employer pays. That means that you she or he gets 100 KCHF per year, but she or he are actually creating a value worth over a million francs.
  - Keep moving; be like the shark that keeps on swimming, because your skills are extremely valuable. Speak out your salary, say it loud, blog about it, so that your peers know how much their work is worth.
- *Send The Elevator Down.*
  - Take conscious decisions in your life. Be aware of your actions and their effect. Do not blush or be embarrassed for changing your opinions. Say “I’m sorry” when required. Listen. Do not be a hotshot. Have integrity and self-respect.
  - Do not criticize or make fun of the technology choices of your peers; for other people will have their own reasons to choose them, and they must be respected. Be prepared to change your mind at any time through learning. One day you might like Windows. One day you might like Android. I am actually liking some parts of Android lately. And that is OK.
  - Desirable developer skills: 1 Ability to ignore new tools and technologies 2 Taste for simplicity 3 Good code deletion skills 4 Humility
- *LLVM.*
  - I think LLVM is the most important software project today, as measured in its long-term impact. Objective-C blocks, Rust & Swift (the two most loved strongly typed and compiled programming languages in the 2016 StackOverflow developer survey,) Dropbox Pyston, the Clang Static Analyser, ARC, Google Souper, Emscripten, LLVMSharp, Microsoft LLILC, Rubymotion, cheerp, watchOS apps, the Android NDK, Metal, all of these things were born out or powered by LLVM. There are compilers using LLVM as a backend for pretty much all the most important languages of today. The .NET CLR will eventually interoperate with it, and Mono already uses it. Facebook has tried to integrate LLVM with HHVM, and WebKit recently switched from LLVM to the new B3 JIT JavaScript compiler.
- *Follow Your Gut.*
  - Follow your gut. You might be lucky, too.
- *APIs Are King.*
  - Remember that chunky is better than chatty, and that clients should be dumb; push as much logic as you can down to the API.
  - Do not invent your own security protocols.
  - Leave REST aside and embrace Socket.io, ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, Erlang, XMPP; explore realtime as the next step in app development. Realtime is not only for chat apps. Remove polling from the equation forever.
- *Fight Complexity.*
  - Refactoring, unit tests, code reviews, pull requests, all of these tools are at your disposal to make sure that the code you ship is the simplest possible architecture that works. This is how you build resilient systems for the long term.

### Conclusion

- The most important thing to remember is that your age does not matter.
- As long as your heart tells you to keep on coding and building new things, you will be young, forever.
