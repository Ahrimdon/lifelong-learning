2 years ago the only language I barely knew PHP (I was seriously just hobbling around in wordpress and joomla and making a mess of things), now I know it inside and out (have worked with OOP frameworks like CI, Laravel, Symfony, and Zend), I've also taught myself JS, jQuery, Angular, C, Python, as well as Git, Grunt, Vagrant, Puppet, SQL, server admin stuff, digesting service APIs such as Ooyala, EC2, Sage, and Authorize.net.

You should always strive to be training on the job, whether it is now, or 10 years from now. I'm teaching myself Objective C right now and have a few apps I'm going to build for fun.

Nothing formal whatsoever with the exception of a once-a-year-conference. Everything I learned was from either being dumped code and told to fix it, or from my coworkers guiding me or even giving me resources (which I did not learn on the job).

My first three months of employment were 400 page books every week and 4-8 hours of class every day, with time alone to compete training projects, quizzes, and exams for internal certification. It helped me get up to speed since I knew so little, but it was expected.

OTOH, pretty much everything I learned about programming, I learned "on the job." My CS degree didn't really teach me a lot about being a software engineer. I knew the syntax of a few languages, and some CS theory, but that's really it. How to actually function as an employee? How to actually build or maintain a non-trivial application? Nothing. I had to teach myself.

When I started it was "here's this project, fix it"

As long as you're not an idiot, you'll be fine. Ask a lot of questions.

This is the biggest fear I have. I don't know if a lot of the guys who didn't receive any training worked at smaller companies, but I feel like it's really hard to adjust if you don't receive some kind of mentor.

I'm currently working in a small company, and I feel that my boss has been incredibly frustrating throughout this process. Giving me little to no direction and feedback. It's incredibly intimidating and nerve-wracking to have this "sink or swim" atmosphere when I feel like everything is pushing me to fail if I don't have some kind of outside help to help me adjust. While I would never expect anyone to hold my hand, I guess I was expecting something other than a desk, an assignment, and a deadline.

Here is the rails application, now add a view, controller and route.
It taught me how to do all of those and how to correctly ask for help.

I was handed the following books: Code, The K&R, The Pragmatic Programmer, and SICP. Told to split my time between reading/working through the books and working on minor projects(first 6 months). I was also told to read numerous programming blogs and get an SO account. Then the lead programmer left for amazon and I moved from Jr. to project lead on two projects since we are such a small shop.
