Katrina Owen:

I want to learn Go, in order for me to use it, I wrote a program in Go that wraps `offlineimap`, so I have to wait for x minutes before I can check email. It's a breakable toy (doesn't matter if it breaks or doesn't work very well).

Things that can be done:

- `#pairwithme` on Twitter.
- Pick one thing you're interested and make up a reason why you need to learn it.
- Teach someone something.
- Read code (Saron's Reading Code Good).
- Pick small project to read and write a blog post about it.
- Find OSS project/refactor/add tests/analyze the tests.
- Read The Little Schemer.

Avdi:

I'm finding excuses to learn during working hours. I find ways to justify learning that will fly with a boss, my wife, and my own conscience.

The mental trick is to think in terms of "research" rather than "learning". As an engineer, research is a vital part of solving problems.

Other tactics:

- Blogging: If blogging is an investment in my career capital, then research for articles is justified.
- If I've had a talk accepted at a users group or conference, it's hard to argue with time spent doing research for the talk.
- Reading literature.
- Going freelance: more freedom in deciding what/how much research was relevant to my work.
