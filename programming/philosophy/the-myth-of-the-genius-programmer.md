Everybody wants to look smart and there's a lot of reasons why. Why do people like to buy stuff endorsed by celebrities? It's in your instinct to find people to idolize and we want to latch on to the simple behaviors/materials who remind us of them.

We have this myth of hey, here's a genius and they lock themselves in a cave. Those folks are super rare.

There is a desire to "be a genius to shock the world". We also don't want people to see our mistakes. Some people want to be seen as being clever, and they work in a cave. How long would you drive before asking directions?

The problem is it inhibits personal and project progress. You should have many people get familiar with the different parts of the code as much as possible.
