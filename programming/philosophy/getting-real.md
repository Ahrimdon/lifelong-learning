## The Starting Line

*Build Less:* Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to everyone else. Instead of one- upping, try one-downing. Instead of outdoing, try underdoing.

Less features
Less options/preferences
Less people and corporate structure Less meetings and abstractions
Less promises

*What’s Your Problem?:* Build software for yourself. A great way to build software is to start out by solving your own problems. You’ll be the target audience and you’ll know what’s important and what’s not. That gives you a great head start on delivering a breakout product.

The key here is understanding that you’re not alone. If you’re having this problem, it’s likely hundreds of thousands of others are in the same boat.

> Scratching your own itch: Open Source developers, scratching their own itches, don’t suffer this. Because they are their own users, they know the correct answers to 90% of the decisions they have to make. I think this is one of the reasons folks come home after a hard day of coding and then work on open source: It’s relaxing. - Dave Thomas, The Pragmatic Programmer

> Born out of necessity: Campaign Monitor really was born out of necessity. For years we’d been frustrated by the quality of the email marketing options out there. We consciously decided not to look at what everyone else was doing and instead build something that would make ours and our customer’s lives a little easier. As it turned out, we weren’t the only ones who were unhappy with the options out there. - David Greiner, founder, Campaign Monitor

> You need to care about it: When you write a book, you need to have more than an interesting story. You need to have a desire to tell the story.You need to be personally invested in some way. If you’re going to live with something for two years, three years, the rest of your life, you need to care about it. - Malcolm Gladwell, author

*Fix Time and Budget, Flex Scope:* Here’s an easy way to launch on time and on budget: keep them fixed. Never throw more time or money at a problem, just scale back the scope. If you can’t fit everything in within the time and budget allot- ted then don’t expand the time and budget. Instead, pull back the scope. There’s always time to add stuff later – later is eternal, now is fleeting. It’s better to make half a product than a half-assed product (more on this later).

> One, two, three...: How does a project get to be a year behind schedule? One day at a time. - Fred Brooks, software engineer and computer scientist

*Have an Enemy:* When we decided to create project management software, we knew Microsoft Project was the gorilla in the room. Instead of fearing the gorilla, we used it as a motivator. We decided Base- camp would be something completely different, the anti-Project.

One bonus you get from having an enemy is a very clear marketing message. People are stoked by conflict. And they also understand a product by comparing it to others. With a chosen enemy, you’re feeding people a story they want to hear. Not only will they understand your product better and faster, they’ll take sides. And that’s a sure-fire way to get attention and ignite passion.

> Don’t follow the leader: *The problem is that once a consumer has bought someone else’s story and believes that lie, persuading the consumer to switch is the same as persuading him to admit he was wrong.* And people hate admitting that they’re wrong.

> Instead, you must tell a different story and persuade listeners that your story is more important than the story they currently believe. If your competition is faster, you must be cheaper. Not just the positioning x/y axis sort of "We are cheaper" claim, but a real story that is completely different from the story that’s already being told. - Seth Godin, author/entrepreneur

*It shouldn't be a Chore:* The less your app is a chore to build, the better it will be. Keep it small and manageable so you can actually enjoy the process.

If your app doesn't excite you, something’s wrong. If you’re only working on it in order to cash out, it will show. Likewise, if you feel passionately about your app, it will come through in the final product. People can read between the lines.

> The presence of passion: In design, where meaning is often controversially subjective or painfully inscrutable, few things are more apparent and lucid than the presence of passion.This is true whether the design of a product delights you or leaves you cold; in either case it's difficult not to detect the emotional investment of the hands that built it.

> Enthusiasm manifests itself readily of course, but indifference is equally indelible. If your commitment doesn't encompass a genuine passion for the work at hand, it becomes a void that is almost impossible to conceal, no matter how elaborately or attractively designed it is. - Khoi Vinh, Subtraction.com and co-founder of Behavior llc

## Stay Lean

*Lower Your Cost of Change:* Change is your best friend. The more expensive it is to make a change, the less likely you’ll make it. And if your competitors can change faster than you, you’re at a huge disadvantage. If change gets too expensive, you’re dead.

Here’s where staying lean really helps you out. The ability to change on a dime is one thing small teams have by default that big teams can never have. This is where the big guys envy the little guys. Cheap and fast changes are small’s secret weapon.

> Emergence: Many common software development practices have the unfortunate side- effect of eliminating any chance for emergent behavior. Most attempts at optimization – tying something down very explicitly – reduces the breadth and scope of interactions and relationships, which is the very source of emergence.

> The harder we tighten things down, the less room there is for a creative, emergent solution.Whether it’s locking down requirements before they are well understood or prematurely optimizing code, or inventing complex navigation and workflow scenarios before letting end users play with the system, the result is the same: an overly complicated, stupid system instead of a clean, elegant system that harnesses emergence.

> Keep it small. Keep it simple. Let it happen. - Andrew Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer

*The Three Musketeers:* For the first version of your app, start with only three people. That’s the magic number that will give you enough manpower yet allow you to stay streamlined and agile. Start with a developer, a designer, and a sweeper (someone who can roam between both worlds).

Talented people don't need endless resources. They thrive on the challenge of working within restraints and using their creativity to solve problems. Your lack of manpower means you’ll be forced to deal with trade-offs earlier in the process – and that’s alright.

*If you can’t build your version one with three people, then you either need different people or need to slim down your initial version.*

*Be Yourself:* Small companies enjoy fewer formalities, less bureaucracy, and more freedom. Smaller companies are closer to the customer by default. That means they can communicate in a more direct and personal way with customers. If you’re small, you can use familiar language instead of jargon.

Your site and your product can have a human voice instead of sounding like a corporate drone. Being small means you can talk with your customers, not down to them.

> Be proudly, defiantly truthful: Embarrassingly, I've been a part of white lies like this in the past, and none of those situations ever resulted in what matters most to a business: meaningful, lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with people who had a real need for the services offered.The better course would have been to be proudly, defiantly truthful about the exact size and breadth of the company.

> Any time at all: From the very beginning we made it easy and transparent for our customers to get in touch with us for any number or questions they might have. On our website we list a toll-free number that forwards to our mobile phones and on our business cards each of us list our mobile numbers.We emphasize to our customers that they can get in touch with us any time no matter what the problem might be. Our customers appreciate this level of trust and no one has ever abused this service. - Edward Knittel, Director of Sales and Marketing, KennelSource

## Priorities

*What's the Big Idea:* Before you start designing or coding anything you need to know the purpose of your product – the vision. Think big. Why does it exist? This vision will guide your decisions and keep you on a consistent path. Whenever there’s a sticking point, ask, “Are we staying true to the vision?”

Your vision should be brief too. A sentence should be enough to get the idea across. Here’s the vision for each of our products:

- Basecamp: Project management is communication
- Backpack: Bring life's loose ends together
- Campfire: Group chat over IM sucks
- To-do List: Competing with a post-it note
- Writeboard: Word is overkill

This vision led us to keep Basecamp as open and transparent as possible. Instead of limiting communication to within a firm, we gave clients access too. We thought less about permissions and more about encouraging all participants to take part. The vision is why we skipped charts, graphs, tables, reports, stats, and spreadsheets and instead focused on communication priorities like messages, comments, to-do lists, and sharing files.

> Make Mantra: Organizations need guideposts.They need an outline; employees need to know each day when they wake up why they’re going to work.This outline should be short and sweet, and all encompassing: Why do you exist? What motivates you? I call this a mantra – a three- or four-word description of why you exist. - Guy Kawasaki, author (from Make Mantra)
