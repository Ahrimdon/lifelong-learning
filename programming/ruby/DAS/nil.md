fetch instead of nil. problem with rails finders because no exception. in rails try to use a bang method so you don't do the nil.

you can instead of attr_reader, just raise an Error.

user your language & libraries intelligently
Invert object relationship
guard against nis in a manual attr reader
introduce new domain concept
