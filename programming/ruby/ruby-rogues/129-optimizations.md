- The place where you learn is th place where you're reaching/stretching. If you stay in your comfort zone, you don't learn because you're not stretching. This zone is just before your panic zone.
- If you're stuck or flailing, check out NOPS.

- N: Notice it.
- O: Own it, and say "yes, this is happening to me." "I'm not going to deny that I'm uncomfortable, I'm just going to own the fact that I'm out of my comfort zone.
- P: Push into it. Just try the stupidest, simplest program and write it over and over. Push into the specific discomfort, make yourself uncomfortable.
- We like to do things we are good at, and we also get recognition for being good at things. Usually we have some kind of natural aptitude, and the rest of it is effort. The rest of it is the time that we put in learning how to do it. This can trump the natural aptitude for some of these things.
- 10,000 hours = deliberate type of effort. The people who have done this are at the very edge of their field.
- Katrina: Practice makes permanent. Practicing something will optimize the neural pathways that you use to do that thing.
- Five types of practice:

- Drills: Focusing on a specific skill.
- Simulations: Safe environment to do something that is real-ish (scrimmages).
- Case studies: You observer and reflect and think deeply and analyze. Try to figure out how people made the specific choices that they did.
- Imitation.


- Kathy Sierra: Expose the beginners to lots and lots of good code so that they have some sort of instinct and they will start recognizing things that may be later they'll know why its good or not.
- "Remember, sucking at something is the first step to becoming sort of good at something."
- Code smells: Programming experts can filter out these criteria. Experienced programmers develop this intuition of which criteria applies right now. "We're supposed to do this, but in this case that's not the most important thing."

## Tips on starting learning something.

- Katrina: It's going to be painful, and it's going to suck and that has to be okay for at least 20 hours. *Start with a very very specific goal. Ex: I want to learn Cassandra and so I will figure out how to take my log files and write it into something.*
- James: This is why it's good to have these little successes along the way, because you're like "Oh, I can do this. I'm getting this."
- Avdi: In tech, I've found that I absolutely have to have an excuse to learn something.
- AFAIK, I'll use MongoDB for those with a large amount of information from everywhere and lots of clients are writing and you don't have time. You don't need ACID, you just need a ton of writes.
- Katrina: I think mistakes are really interesting, in that you get to ask, "what do I not like about what I just did?"
- David: You can sit down with an old friend and just chat and just exchange ideas.
- If you're familiar with a book's ideas already, then it's easier to learn. If you have to get a ton of new ideas, you hit speed bumps.
- Information retrieval bias: We tend to value information more if we had to go get it ourselves. If we're just reading casually, the thing you learn is emotionally not that valuable for you
- Avdi: I skim/read books straight through. It's about making myself aware of where to find the information that I need when I need it. What I hate is not knowing whole areas of a language that I'm learning in.
- If I haven't used a method enough times to automatically memorize it, to just have my brain cache, then I don't feel any compulsion to force myself to do it. I think that's just wasting brain space.
- I'm comfortable with the sense that I have. I don't feel the need to actually commit all that stuff to memory as opposed to just knowing it exists.
