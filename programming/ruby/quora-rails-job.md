## [What steps should I take to get my first Rails development job?](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-on-Rails-web-framework/What-steps-should-I-take-to-get-my-first-Rails-development-job)

The key to getting a job is continually making things, blogging about them (or things you learn along the way), and letting people know about it. 

Start writing ruby gems or fixing bugs in ones you use on github. Start posting your interesting projects on sites like Hacker News (http://news.ycombinator.com) and Reddit in /r/programming and/or /r/ruby.

Get familiar with Rails, by doing. Post your code to Github, so others can see what you've done. And if possible, get people using what you've made.

The second round of advice given to me, was to contribute to the open source community. Find a project that interests you, and use it. Look for bugs, or potential features, and fix/add them. Github is a great place for this, because you can simply browse through already known issues, and submit a fix straight to the project admin.

A few friends of mine, who actually interview Rails candidates, say they look for people who can think pragmatically. They sometimes ask questions like, "How many cars are currently in San Francisco?", or "Write a program that would tell me what people are currently twittering most about, today?" 

"What's the difference between private, protected, and public?" 
"What does REGEX stand for, and what is it?"
"Define the various terms, class, object, method?"
"What does MVC stand for?"
"What does DRY stand for?"
"What is an iterator?"

"Describe some of the HTML5 tags?"
"What does ORM stand for?"
"What's the difference between attr_accessor and attr_accessible?"
"What are the various model relationships assignments in ActiveRecord?"
"Describe how to build a has_many, and belong_to_many model relationship."
"What are the various model validations in Rails?"
"What's a hash, and how do you add/remove values from it?"
"What's the difference between extend and inlcude?"
"What is a Ruby Module?"
"What is unit testing?"
"What is noSQL?"
"What is REDIS?"
"How would you diagnose, and resolve slow DB queries?"
"How does nginx differ from Apache?"
"What is a Rails environment?"
"What are the various Ruby iterators?"
"When might you use the inject method?"
"What's your favorite Ruby gem, and why?"

## [What are the minimum level of skills for an entry level RoR job?](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-on-Rails-web-framework/What-are-the-minimum-level-of-skills-for-an-entry-level-RoR-job)

Entry Level Knowledge -  Things you must know as a junior web developer

Create and setup a Rails environment
Use generators to create models, controllers and migrations
Create and use a migration to manage the database
Create a unit test using rspec/etc
Create a model and basic validations
Handle a GET request using a Controller, Model, and View
Handle a POST request using a Controller, Model, and View
Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Basic GIT - clone, commit, push

You should work for a consultancy if you want to get exposed to different challenges on regular intervals.
You should work for a startup if you want to play multiple roles initially and then eventually settle down as an expert in a particular module.
Established businesses are bad for you if are looking to learn and grow in my point of view.

If you can code a rails app from scratch not relying on scaffolds and devise for user auth you have enough of a basis to learn from. 

Plus you will learn faster being in a team of other developers rather than venturing on your own so it really just depends on your ability to learn. 

I say start now because anytime spent not practicing your craft full time with others who have more experience is essentially wasted potential.

I am going to be a little contrarian here. You don't need almost any skills to be hired as a programmer. 

Programmers are very much in demand. If you look promising, some companies will hire you based on a couple of side projects. I think personally the minimum viable experience necessary is about a couple of test apps on github. 

Absolutely as a developer you are always on google, stackoverflow etc. 

Being part of a dev team shortens that cycle and also helps explain some of the Rails "magic" or "glue" which is often a bit difficult to glean just from books, but super easy and quick with some mentorship. 

At interviews just demonstrate your ability and drive to learn and show them how you reason through problems. 

Critical thinking is the most important value that a dev can possess and that transcends the particular language or framework you use. 

A company you would like to work for will focus on this as much if not more than your experience assuming they have a role available where a junior dev can contribute and be nurtured to grow.

## [Why is it so hard to get a job as a Rails developer?](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-on-Rails-web-framework/Why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-a-job-as-a-Rails-developer)

My guess is that you aren't interviewing well or aren't showing your strengths well. Spend as much time thinking about how you interview as you do about code. 

Put as much code as you can on GitHub. 

If you're applying to a start-up you're sort of going to be a big fish in a small pond, so getting in with the team is really tricky.  You don't want to come off as too skilled, because they are usually threatened by this (not a good fit for the team), but you also don't want to come across as incompetent (too junior).

Have an active GitHub profile that people can see your work, contribute to open source projects (or create and opensource some), and I'd be very surprised if you have a hard time finding work. I see Rails devs in demand everywhere I look (used to run sales for a Rails dev shop) - but good devs regardless of language are gold.

## [How do you get a job as Rails developer?](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-on-Rails-web-framework/How-do-you-get-a-job-as-Rails-developer)

Have a clean, solid, resume. This is the most important since this is the first thing people see and will determine if you actually get a chance. __From my experience, there's usually a 60% response rate when you have had at least 1 full time Rails job/project before.__

Have some open source contributions/projects in Github. This is not required but definitely a nice to have and will show your coding prowess. T__his is the best bang for the buck IMO.__ If they turn out to be popular or helpful, then you should already be getting tons of emails.

## [Will I get a Ruby on Rails jobs in India as a college dropout?](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-on-Rails-web-framework/Will-I-get-a-Ruby-on-Rails-jobs-in-India-as-a-college-dropout)

Learning a language or framework can get you a job now ( when the framework/ language is 'hot'). But requirements change, and so do technologies, and all that remains are the basics, that you have learnt early on in your career.

Spend 1 year taking courses on Coursera, Udacity and the likes. Then spend the next 3 months picking up Ruby, and the last 3 months picking up Rails.

Learn and practice ruby . RoR is merely a framework but you wont be able to leverage it completely unless you know ruby inside out .

Javascript / Css concepts - Remember rails is a web framework so its imperative you know them . Rails has actually blurred the line between web developer and web designer .
