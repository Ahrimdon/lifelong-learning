Twilio messaging:

- When you buy an SMS-enabled Twilio phone number, you can associate that phone number with a URL. When someone sends an SMS to that phone number, Twilio make an HTTP request to your URL with the body of the message.
- To send a message, HTTP POST to Twilio with the body of the message and the phone number you want to send it to. SMS messages must be sent from Twilio SMS-enabled phone numbers.
- Tracking conversations: HTTP cookies.
