## Prying a file

    $ pry
    > load "./file.rb" # Inside the file, you need to have:

    def a
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    end

    so you can access the vars
    > a #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


## [Rubyists, Itâ€™s Time to PRY Yourself Off IRB!](http://www.sitepoint.com/rubyists-time-pry-irb/)

Installation

    $ gem install pry pry-doc
    $ pry -v
    pry(main)>

Show documentation

    pry(main)> show-doc Array#map

Cd into an object

    pry(main)> cd arr
    pry(#<Array>)>
    pry(#<Array>)>ls #list all methods
    pry(#<Array>)>ls -h
    pry(#<Array>)>show-source map! #Show implementation of underlying code.

Able to see shit via the `binding.pry` method. But you have to define the editor first. So you can `edit` the method.

    pry(#<Order>) edit total

Stack trace: `wtf?` Longer stack trace: `wtf??`

List variables

### Learning about your context with the ls command

**Note:** This command has been significantly updated since Pry version 0.9.7. Some of the options below may work differently if you are using an earlier version; it is recommended you upgrade.

The `ls` command is essentially a unified wrapper to a number of Ruby's introspection mechanisms, including (but not limited to) the following methods: `methods`, `instance_variables`, `constants`, `local_variables`, `instance_methods`, `class_variables` and all the various permutations thereof.

By default typing `ls` shows you the local variables defined in the current context, and any public methods or instance variables defined on the current object.

Usage:

    ls [-m|-M|-p|-pM] [-q|-v] [-c|-i] [Object]
    ls [-g] [-l]

Options:

    -m, --methods        Show public methods defined on the Object (default)
    -M, --module         Show methods defined in a Module or Class
    -p, --ppp            Show public, protected (in yellow) and private (in green) methods
    -q, --quiet          Show only methods defined on object.singleton_class and object.class
    -v, --verbose        Show methods and constants on all super-classes (ignores Pry.config.ls.ceiling)
    -g, --globals        Show global variables, including those builtin to Ruby (in cyan)
    -l, --locals         Show locals, including those provided by Pry (in red)
    -c, --constants      Show constants, highlighting classes (in blue), and exceptions (in purple)
    -i, --ivars          Show instance variables (in blue) and class variables (in bright blue)
    -G, --grep           Filter output by regular expression
    -h, --help           Show help

## Rails Conf 2013 Pry-- The Good Parts by Conrad Irwin

Devs spend 60% of the time is spent debugging. Think of Pry has a lot of small features.

Pry's variable on last output: `_`.

    $ wtf?               # Show backtrace
    $ _ex_               # Show last exception
    $ cat basic_auth.rb  # Open a file inside of pry
    $ require _file_     # _file_ is an alias of the last file taken.
    $ $ BasicAuth.decode # Show source of the module
    $ edit               # Give a method name and it will open in the editor. Pry has actually edited it.

    $ play -l 19         # Playing the 19th line, same as executing it
    $ cd new_post        # Go inside the variable
    :1> ls               # Show the methods/instance variables inside the variable itself
    :> edit --ex         # Opening the file itself and going to the last exception
    $ .git diff          # Adding a dot before = running it in the Shell
    :> edit --ex         # Opening the file itself and going to the last exception
    $ puts "hello";      # Tell Pry to skip the output phase, just show side effects.

Plugins:

- `pry-rescue`: Automatically opens pry wherever you have an unhandled exception or test failure.
- `pry-stack_explorer`: Lets you move up/down the call stack as though you had a binding.pry at ever level.
- `BetterErrors.use_pry!`
- `pry-debugger`: Adds break, step/next, continue.
- `pry-plus`: Collection of the plugins.
