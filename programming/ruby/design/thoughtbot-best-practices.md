## General
- Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
- Don't "fail silently".
- Don't write code that guesses future functionality.
- Exceptions: Only do it when you REALLY have to. Ex: Files. If a file "should have been there", then yes throw one. If it doesn't seem exceptional if you can't find a file, then return an error.
- Keep the code simple (read article on simplicity).
