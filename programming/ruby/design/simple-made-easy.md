Simple means one thing, "easy" another. A thing is simple if it has no interleaving, it has one purpose, one concept, one dimension, one task. Easy is the opposite of difficult.

Speaking English is easy, but it is not simple. Speaking French for French kids is easy for them, but it is not simle.

What matters is the artefact (what the users use) as opposed to the contracts (source code, libraries, language concepts). __We need to assess our constructs based on the attributes of the artefacts that we'll create, not based on the experience of typing code in.__

When things are complex, many parts are tied together by definition. You need to reason about a system to know what to change and to do so without introducing defects. Tests, refactoring, rapid deployment are greate but to make a change, you need to be able to reason about it.

Focus on simplicity: You'll be slower in the beginning, because you'll have to do some work to simplify the problem space, but making sure you only have intrinsic complexity means that your rate of devleopment will remain at a high constant.

What matters is that constructs don't yield high complexity. If we build things simply, then the resulting systme is easier to debug, easier to change and easier to understand.
