## [A Home For Enterprising Developers](http://rubycon.rkcudjoe.com/a-home-for-enterprising-developers/)

The Ruby and the web development community is full of entreprising individuals â€“ authors, conference organizers, consultants, and teacher-mentors.

Some business advice I've encountered, aimed at developers and designers, or creatives in general, are too prescriptive. They teach business ideas as if it's a hard skill.

One of the most popular advice I've encountered in the bloggosphere encourages people to capture email addresses of visitors to their site by giving away free content and promising more.

So, I had a gap in my knowledge about business and in the process of filling it, I decided to share what I'm learning, even if it's just a fraction of it.

I had two motivations for sharing it. The first is that others might find it useful; especially the enterprenuers amongst us. Second, I needed to create experiences from which I can glean some insights, if I'm to write consistently.

I've seen bloggers do this and I actually like it. Sharing your reading material with your audience is an excellent way to develop a common body of knowledge and language.
