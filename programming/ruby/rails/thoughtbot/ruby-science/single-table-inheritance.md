[TODO] this. I don't really understand everything.

## Single Table Inheritance (STI)

Rails provides a mechanism for storing instances of different classes in the same table, called Single Table Inheritance. 

Rails will take care of most of the details, writing the classâ€™s name to the type column and instantiating the correct class when results come back from the database.

#### Symptoms
- You need to change from one subclass to another.
- Behavior is shared among some subclasses but not others.
- One subclass is a fusion of one or more other subclasses.

> a/m/question.rb

    def switch_to(type, new_attributes)
        attributes = self.attributes.merge(new_attributes)
        new_question = type.constantize.new(attributes.except('id', 'type')) 
        new_question.id = id
    
        begin Question.transaction do
            destroy
            new_question.save!
        end

        rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid 
        end

        new_question
    end

#### This is difficult because:

- You need to worry about common `Question` validations.
- You need to make sure validations for the old subclass are not used.
- You need to make sure validations for the new subclass are used.
- You need to delete data from the old subclass, including associations.
- YOu need to support data from the new subclass.
- Common attributes need to remain the same.

#### Solutions
- If you're using STI to reuse common behavior, use __Replace Subclasses with Strategies__.
- If you're using STI so you can easily refer to severaldifferentclasses in the same table, switch to using a polymorphic association instead.
