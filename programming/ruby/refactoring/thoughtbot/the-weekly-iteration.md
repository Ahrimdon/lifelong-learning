## Extract Class

Anyone I hear the word parsing I usually extract it. So I extract the parser.

To start I write the code I wish I had (`Parser.new`, failing test.) Create the `Parser` test. It's really imporant to run small, fast, focused tests. Better too if the tests are in the editor because you have to tab out too.
