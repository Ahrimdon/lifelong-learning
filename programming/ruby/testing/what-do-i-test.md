## Why We Don't Write Tests

__Writing tests seems longer at first.__ It sucks when a project requires more time and attention that what you think. At first, the value of testing seems absurd. So what if an app is well tested? Features are better.

You aren't taking longer to write the tests. You are just doing the hard part first. Just know the assertion syntax and you'll work faster than you were previously.

__Testing is not necessary to build a Rails app.__ You don't have to write tests to be a Rails developer. But this changes over time and everyone who has added testing to their development workflow will insist that an application doesn't work until it's fully tested.

__The community is split between Specs and Assertions.__ The strategy to get testing to stick was to think of it as just that: Rails testing. Do things the Rails way, and the Rails way is to use tests.

__We often work alone.__ You're either never going to be the only developer on a project, or you will never be able to remember everything you've contributed to a project. Future you is different from present you. Writing tests is the way to tell the team that "my code works". Being a good teammate means making sure you make it as easy as possible for your other team members.

__Our development process isn't perfect.__ You tell yourself you write beautiful code but then you debug something that you hadn't thought of until it happened. A good development process is one that makes me think before I start writing and lines of code. It's one that forces me to consider all the different situtations that could exist, and build the feature to accomodate these situations.

__We work in spikes as we're learning.__ In the test-driven development world, a spike is a period of time where you are supposed to dedicate to building exploratory code. It's a time where you can figure out what you are going to build without having to worry about writing tests to support our work.
