# [Mocks Aren't Stubs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)

This difference is actually two separate differences. On the one hand there is a difference in how test results are verified: a distinction between state verification and behavior verification. On the other hand is a whole different philosophy to the way testing and design play together, which I term here as the classical and mockist styles of Test Driven Development.
