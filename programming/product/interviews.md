- Big company: specialization. On learning about hiring: mostly from making mistakes.
- In a PM: Raw, intellectual horsepower. *Product management is fundamentally about thinking on your feet, staying one step ahead of your competitors, and being able to project yourself into the minds of your colleagues and your customers.*
- In a PM: strong tech background. Engineering background = relating to engineers + a grasp of the tech details driving the product. Easier to convey requirements to engineers and relaying complicated details to non-technical colleagues and customers.
  - There is an adaptation period from technical → product. Moving from engineering to product management, biggest advantage and disadvantage of having a technical background, big lesson you learned when you moved from engineering to PM.
- In a PM: Product instincts and creativity.
- In a PM: Leadership that's earned.
- In a PM: Channeling multiple points-of-view. Engineering, design, and marketing.
- Give me someone who’s shipped something.
