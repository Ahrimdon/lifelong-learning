# The Product Manager Role

- A PM is the person on a product team who is responsible for choosing the right problems to go after, defining what success looks like, and guiding their team to achieve successful outcomes.
- To be a great PM, you can't just follow the steps; you need to reliably build and ship successful products.
- Product triad:
  - Engineer, designer, product manager.
  - *Product managers are responsible for selecting and defining which problems the team is going to solve, then ensuring the team solves them. They'll define what success looks like, and plan how to get there.*
- Discovering: Product discovery: What is the underlying problem that they were trying to solve?
  - You're looking for a problem that's large enough to be worth solving, while feasible enough for your team to be successful.

## Tasks during product discovery:

- Reading through feature requests
- Analyzing funnel metrics
- Interviewing customers
- Testing concept mocks
- Discussing long-term strategy
- Researching competitors
- Doing market analysis
- Holding brainstorming sessions
- Running design sprints

- Define: Narrow down the problem to a specific, feasible slice, and frame it so it's ready for the team.
- Design: Validating ideas with real people. UX = mockups and visual prototypes, tech solution: design docs and technical prototypes.
- Develop: Writing stories or tickets for tech, which metrics to instrument and track, checking in with teammates to unblock them, trying out each feature as it's being built, keeping stakeholders and approvers up-to-date.
- Delivery: Setting up validation phases, organise QA, working with launch partners, marketing, training salespeople.
- Debrief:
  - Running a retrospective on what went well and what didn't.
  - Analyzing launch metrics.
  - Reading customer feedback on the launch.

Great PM? *There are a lot of reliable frameworks and best practices that will improve your chances of shipping a successful product. The frameworks won't transform you into a great product manager overnight or guarantee that your products never fail, but they'll help you avoid the most common problems and give you some structure to start experimenting, reflecting, and improving. They are not a replacement for good judgment.*

## The First 90 Days

- Set yourself up for long-term success on your new team.
  - Learn about the team, align on expectations, align on your onboarding plans, form strong relationships, earn credibility, get in some quick wins.
  - PM/feature team: learn processes, get access to tools, learn about team's current plans & needs, shadow current PM.
  - Introductory 1:1 with everyone, weekly 1:1s with manager.
  - Become expert on the customers and the product - join sales calls, onsite visits, and research sessions.
  - Read or answer customer support tickets.
  - Use the product, document first impressions, skim the help guide.
- It's easier to lead people through influence if you can show them that you understand their goals and care about them as people.
- Your manager:
  - What is your working style?
  - How would you like us to work together?
  - How would you like to communicate; do you prefer written or in person?
  - Do you have any pet peeves? Any things you love?
  - What are your top goals for this year?
  - How can I best help with your goals?
  - Is there anything else I should know about you?
- My role:
  - How do you see my role?
  - What makes a great PM?
  - What does success look like to you?
  How much are you expecting my to shake things up in the beginning vs execute on the current plans?
  - Are there any landmines or controversies to avoid?
  - Do you have any ideas for quick wins where I could help the team?
  - When is my first feedback or review cycle? Is there anything specific you'd like me to achieve by then?
- Teammates:
  - Getting-to-know-you questions: Tell me about yourself. What brought you to this company? What are you working on now? What are some of your favorite past projects? What are you looking forward to working on? What are your top goals for the year?
  - Aligning on expectations - How would you like to see us work together? What are your expectations for me? Are there things you've liked, or no liked, about working with people in my role before? Do you have any pet peeves?
  - Opportunities: How are you feeling about the team and how things have been going? Is there anything you're hoping to change about how the team works? Do you have any ideas for where I could find quick wins to help the team?
- Everyone else:
  - Tell me about yourself, what are you working on, what are your favorites past projects, what are you looking forward to working on? What are your top goals for this year? How would you like to see us work together? Are there things you've liked, or not liked, about working with people in my role before?

# User Insight

- Validating assumptions: Building a product to reorder search results - some users optimised for the global look and feel of the page, not for each item individually.
- What to validate?
  - Why users choose your product over an alternative?
  - Which features are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?
  - How much time and attention users put into learning the product.
  - "Minor" usability issues.
  - The discoverability of a feature.
  - The extent of the inertia to begin using the product.
- Connect product choices to customer insights: Engineers or executives aren't as immersed in customer insights as you are. They might have forgotten a key finding from research, or might not notice the same connections as you do.
- Line-by-line annotations of the product design - like why things are like this, what is the intention of the design.
- Evangelizing your customer insights: The way they continually surface relevant customer information.
  - Introducing a real-life example in a meeting.
  - Points other PMs to relevant user research.
  - Giving a company-wide talk on key insights.
  - Presenting insights and their strategic implications to executives.
- Customer journey: Awareness, consideration, purchase, retention, advocacy.
- Usability guidelines:
  - Visibility of system status: should always keep the users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
  - Match between system and the real world.
  - User control and freedom: Emergency exit, undo/redo.
  - Consistency/standards.
  - Error preventions: Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
  - Recognition rather than recall: Make objects, actions, and options visible.
  - Accelerator: let experienced users be faster.
  - Aesthetics/minimalist design: dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.
  - Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors.
  -  Limited attention: Real users pay much less attention to your product's UI than you'd guess.
  - Accessibility: 4% of the population is color blind.

# Data Insight

- What does success mean to you and the company?
- Create a dashboard for the team.
  - Success metrics, precursors for the success, how people are using the product, how we can reduce noise.
- Speed of cycles is critical in data analysis.
- Good metrics vs vanity metrics.

# Analytical Problem Solving

- Analytical skills aren't about sudden strokes of genius, they are about structured problem solving.
- Ex: "If this is the first translation, then the language doesn't matter, the most important factor was the willingness among the customer base to tolerate translation mistakes.
- Consider these ambiguous problems:
  - Should we delay the launch to include new features or to polish the product?
  - Which metrics should we be trying to improve?
  - Which user problem should we focus on?
  - How can we increase revenue?
  - How can we increase the usage of this feature?
  - Do we build our own solution or should we buy one?
  - Why did the graphs show a drop on a particular day?
- Triaging and reproducing bugs:
  - Damage to users, damage to company, impact on metrics, scale of impact, workarounds, ease of fixing, "now or later", cost-benefit relative to other work.
- Systems thinking:
  - Feedback loops: Will the results of this also act as inputs in the next round?
  - Cannibalisation: If one product is successful, will it decrease the usage of another?
  - Funnel stages: If you widened the top of the funnel to bring in more sign-ups, could those users behave differently later in the funnel?
  - What impact does this new functionality have on other components such as search, notifications, permissions or onboarding? Are there implementation choices that affect what "nice-to-have" behaviours you'll get for free?
  - Incentives: Does success in one part of the product change user behaviours elsewhere?
- Improving systems-level thinking means deepening your understanding of the underlying infrastructure.

## Growth Practices

- If you're about to look at experiment results, make a quick estimation of what you think the numbers might be.
- If you're about to attend a meeting, try to guess what each person will say.
- If you're about to go to a training session, hypothesis what the advice will be.
- Articulating a framework:
  - This shows the logic and consistency behind your decisions. Writing them down gives you something concrete to improve upon.
  - Building credibility: "Why did he do this?"
  - Less team frustration: If they are only aware of the decision change, they might think that you hadn't thought through your original decision adequately.
  - Efficiency: Your teammates can use your framework and answer some of your own questions rather than always having to come to you for answers.
  - Improved decision making: Your frameworks will improve as you articulate them.
- Concepts and Frameworks:
  - `2x2` Matrix.
  - Red/yellow/green tables: Can create a table where the columns are the criteria and the rows are the options.
  - "If we're optimising for...".
  - Decision tree.
- Eigenquestion: "If we decided this, what other questions would be answered?"
  - Check in with your teammates on how they feel about the options. If people are uncomfortable with your proposed option, take the time to fully understand why.
  - Commit and determine accountability. Make sure you know who is responsible for communicating the decision and making it happen.
- Five Whys.
  - Why did this problem happen?
  - Often, a process failure is identified as an underlying case for failures etc.
  - If a developer submitted code that crashed, why wasn't it caught by test cases?

# Product and Design Skills

- Product and design sense is about much more than making things look pretty. Building great products requires translating insights into good product decisions. It requires focusing on what's most important to a product's success.
- Design sprint:
  - Understand: Gather information about problems, opportunities, and goals from experts across the company.
  - Define: Choose your problem or opportunity, goals, and success metrics.
  - Sketch: Generate a range of potential solutions.
  - Decide: Select a concept to prototype.
  - Prototype: Prepare a testable prototype.
  - Validate: Put the prototype in front of users and get feedback to validate or invalidate the concept.
- Goals to clarify:
  - Is the key success metric to get new users, increase engagement, or monetise?
  - Does your new feature save people time or help them get better results?
  - Are you trying to lure customers away from a competitor?
  - Is there a specific use case you're trying to enable?
  - Are you aiming to quickly validate an idea, or launch something fully polished?
  - How much user backlash are you expecting and willing to tolerate?

# Technical Skills

- What does "Hard to build" actually mean?
  - Take a long time.
    - It would be expensive to build - the pre-built component would need to support the functionality we want.
    - There could be other parts involved that are needed to make your idea work.
    - They would have to touch a part of the code base they are not familiar with.
    - It would need a data migration.
  - Performance would be slow/have poor scalability.
    - Ex: Counting a subset of a list that contains millions of items.
    - Change the product to something that needs fewer calculations.
    - Denormalise, cache, or pre-calculate stuff.
  - It could introduce technical debt that makes future projects take longer to build.

# Writing Product Documentation

- Easy to understand
  - Diagrams/pictures.
  - Bullet points.
  - Keep it short.
  - Include information about alternatives considered and your reasoning.
  - Highlight controversial parts/places where you need feedback and alignment.
  - Check in with key partners for feedback.
- Be clear when the spec stops becoming the source of truth.

# Project Management

- Lean: Validate the product with customers before investing too heavily in building it out.
- Agile: Iterate into multiple small launches.
- Scrum: Sprints are done in 1-4 weeks. At the start of each sprint, sprint planning where they pull from backlog and estimate how much work can be done in the next sprint.
- Kanban: "Not started", "In progress", "In review", "Done".
- Have an explicit conversation about your project management responsibilities.
  - Status reports: Is the project on track?
- What do you do when your team falls behind schedule?
  - Add more people to the project
  - Move the launch date
  - Cut scope
- Days to invest in areas that get overlooked: Bugs, polish, internal tools.
- Drive quality and velocity improvements:
  - Launches miss target: Figure out the scope.
  - Launches miss their dates: Were the estimates off?
  - Teams spend a lot of time on other priorities instead of their main project: Can we move on to a culture where all work is scheduled and has attached goals or OKRs?
  - Process slows the team down.
  - Mismatch between your expectations and the skill level of the teams: investing in training and mentorship, hire more skilled people.

# Scoping and Incremental Development

# Product Launches

# Get Things Done

- Action-oriented: Done is better than perfect. Being enthusiastic and slightly impatient.
- High capacity: Know how to manage your own time.
- Reliable: You do what you said you'd do. Follow up on commitments and renegotiate if cannot keep them.
- Time management:
  - You have more work to do than can actually be done.
  - There is an ideal vs an actual time allocation.
  - Make a pie chart of how you'd ideally spend your time. 25% ideally for things that come up. 15% for strategic thinking.
  - Delete, defer, delegate, diminish.
  - Big rocks first.
- Uninterrupted work: Set time for this. If you can take a Friday off work if your friend was getting married, then you can take a strategy day to invest in the future of the team.
- Communicate proactively.
- Prioritise being responsive to your team: filter email, filter `@` mentions, chat.
- Figure out when to do synchronous and asynchronous communication.
- ***What does success look like?***
- Ex of breaking the rule: Offer free trial at Slack ONLY after they had used the free product for a week.
- Monthly priorities with the team:
  - Share brief update on your priorities for each month.

# Product Strategy Overview

- Where you want the product to go and making a plan to get there. It's about understanding the industry, market, and trend to predict what will be important in the future. It's about creating a vision, setting ambitious goals, and convincing your team that you're heading in the right direction.
- Strategic Vision: Painting an inspiring vision of what the product can be in two years and choosing projects that work towards that vision.
- Strategic competitive framework: Identifying a valuable customer segment that the competitor handles poorly and then prioritise must-have projects to focus on winning over their customers.
- Strategic framework: We are writing a clear, opinionated framework about which bets you're making and why.
- Strategic company strategy: Understand the company's strategic direction, as well as the goals of other teams across the product and business, and using that to choose a direction that supports the bigger picture.

# Vision

- Airbnb Instant book - Go big on it and try to defuse the mines that can happen when you do an instant book.
- Vision questions
  - If we were starting a new company from scratch, what would "ideal" look like?
  - What's the slowest part, and how could we make it twice, or even ten times as fast?
  - What's the most frustrating step, and how could we remove it?
  - What would a delightful experience be?
  - If a customer didn't understand any technical constraints, what magical thing would they ask for?
  - What are some new cutting-edge technologies, inside or outside of our company?
  - Could we use any of them to open up new possibilities?
  - If our company was willing to spend any amount of money on this project, what kinds of new things would be possible?
  - Who is not using our product? Why not? What would it take to win them over?
  - How could we double the impact this product makes for our customers?
  - What are the market trends, and where do we think the market will be in ten years?
  - How are the expectations and habits of our users changing, and does that open up new possibilities?

# Strategic Framework

- Slack strategy: Selling innovation. Since people don't know they want Slack, there is no tolerance for flaws. They must be excellent.

# Roadmap and Prioritisation

# Team Goals

- Forcing teams to be thoughtful about the purpose of their work.
- Supporting cross-team communication, coordination, and alignment.
- Goals represent a shared set of priorities and are one of the fastest ways to understand what people are working on.
- Creating an anchor point for reflection and learning.
- If you don't write down your intentions, you can't tell when you're exceeding or missing them.
- Helping teams make better trade-offs and decisions.
- Creating the nudge that many people need to finish up work and ship it, rather than iterating endlessly.
- Enabling product leaders to ensure teams are working towards strategically valuable outcomes.
- Establishing clear expectations of what success looks like.
- Team goals
  - Specific: what are you planning to do, and what will the impact be if it is successful?
  - Measurable: How will you know if you hit the goal or not? What are the concrete criteria for success?
  - Achievable: The goal should be ambitious, but achievable. This also applies to the set of goals your team is signing up for.
  - Relevant: Does the goal contribute to your team or company strategy?
  - Time-bound: Goals should always be tied to dates.
- OKR framework.

# Personal Mindset

- Growth mindset: "Know-it-all to learn-it-all".
- Great PM: ego-less.
- Intellectual humility: incredibly smart, but always open to the idea that they might be wrong.
- Maturity:
  - Respect for expertise. Experience isn't everything, but you shouldn't act like you know it all after trying something once.
  - Awareness of context: Don't come charging into a new situation and assume you found the perfect solution that everyone else missed.
  - Seeing the nuance: Most solutions have complex trade-offs.
  - Restraint: Let other people speak first and don't interrupt.
  - Diplomacy: You need to be able to get alignment and buy-in without causing tension.
  - Judgment.
  - Healthy culture: If you complain, gossip, or reinforce an "us vs them" culture, you might be stirring up trouble.
  - Admitting mistakes.
  - Change your mind. Change your mind with better information, and strike compromises when it's appropriate.
- Equanimity: Keeping calm under pressure. When things go wrong, the PM needs to stay calm and think rationally.
- Impostor syndrome. Don't do these.
  - Not asking important questions for fear of looking stupid.
  - Not applying for promotions or roles that you're ready for.
  - Declining an invitation to speak at a conference because you're not sure you have enough to say of value, particularly in comparison to the other "more impressive" speakers.
  - Getting sleep deprived due to excessive work hours spent trying to get things perfect.
- Drama triangle
  - Your mood and mindset affect your team. When you're stressed, your team notices. When you fixate on who's right or wrong, it's harder to solve problems.
  - Maturity: Mostly about slowing down, paying attention, and respecting other people. While accusations of immaturity often carry some bias, maturity is a real leadership skill that doesn't just mean "grow older".
  - Everyone will have doubts. These are tough decisions with no right answers.

# Collaboration

- Treat people like your partners:
  - Include people early in the product life cycle and give them a chance to influence the direction.
  - Learn about their concerns and take them seriously.
  - Include them in your core team meetings or create regular partner meetings.
  - Say "our launch" instead of "my launch".
- Optimise for long-term relationships.
- Big 5:
  - Conscientiousness: Impulse control, self-discipline, following through.
  - Extraversion.
  - Agreeableness: Being right vs being likeable.
  - Neuroticism: Emotional.
  - Openness to experience.

# Influencing Without Authority

- Everything you achieve happens because you persuaded someone else to go along with your plan.
- Earn credibility: Articulating your framework, be confident, do what you said you'd do.

# Communication

- Written communication:
  - Use clear subject line, don't write mysterious lines, just ask the question, put a TL, DR at the top if things are long.
  - Don't leave non-critical details.
  - Use pictures, prototypes, or diagrams to reinforce the important ideas.
- Make the CTA clear: Be explicit about what you want people to do, and by when.
  - Do assign tasks to make sure they don't miss the action they're supposed to take, depending on your company culture.
  - Do tell people where to give you feedback - comments in the doc or in a private message.
- Live conversation: Figure out when.
- Meetings:
  - Agenda for the meeting.
  - Don't let the meeting run over.
  - Assign a note-taker.
  - Match the meeting format to the goals.
  - Do send information before the meeting so people can prepare their thoughts in advance.
  - Do ask each person to share any questions or concerns.

# Motivation and Inspiration

# Ownership Mentality

# Mentoring

# Working with Other Departments

- Designers
  - Do we want check-ins to go over designs, or will the designer reach out proactively when they're ready for feedback? Can you see their progress on a regular cadence?
  - Do they like to start with a group brainstorm, or would they rather have time to think about the problem independently first?
  - How would they like you to share your ideas with them?
  - Are they okay if you draw some wireframes?
  - What level of detail do they like in setting up the problem and constraints?
  - Will they show you different directions that they've considered?
  - When should designs use realistic customer data and when is it okay to use lorem ipsum placeholder text?
  - How early in the process will the designer consider onboarding and empty states?
  Will the designer set and share their own dates?
  - Do not bait-and-switch them.
  - Invest in design debt and design systems improvement.

# Becoming a People Manager

# New Leadership Skills for PM Managers

# Career Ladders

- Associate PM: Few scope, low-risk, small set of engineers, hands-on mentorship.
- PM 1: Can you kickoff a new project, do you know when to do product discovery, are you able to use spec review, can you pull cross-functional teams together to launch features?
- Senior PM: The right answer usually is "it depends".
  - Runs one or more teams independently: Can take on more teams with time to spare for strategic work.
  - Solves complex and ambiguous problems with no right answer.
  - Drives end-to-end success of their product Takes responsibility for ensuring all functions (including marketing, sales, and customer support) work together to deliver the customer and business results desired.
  - Drives alignment on team strategy and roadmap with limited support: Creates an ambitious vision based on customer and business insights and determines the path to get there.
  - Thinks through competing priorities and complex trade-offs to come up with a good strategy.

# Career Goals

- Zone of genius: Excellent and it feels great.
  - What do you love to do most? (You love it so much you can do it for long stretches of time without getting tired or bored.)
  - What work do you do that doesn't actually feel like work?
  - In your work, what produces the highest ratio of abundance and satisfaction to the amount of time spent?
  - What is your unique ability? What unique ability of yours, fully realized and put to work, can provide enormous value to you and/or your company?
- *When did you feel really fulfilled and proud of what you did.*
- Imagining your ideal job:
  - What kind of challenges do you enjoy?
  - Which of your strengths do you like to use?
  - What are you passionate about?
  - What would you do if you had enough money to never have to work again?
  - How would you change your current job to make it better?
  - What would you want to do if you couldn't work at your current company anymore?
  - Who do you admire? Who are your role models? What about them do you want to emulate? What would you like to do differently than them?
  - If you imagine three, five, or ten years in the future, what would you love to be doing?

# Skills for Career Growth

- Managers are only human.
  - They assume you don't want a challenging new assignment without asking you.
  - They don't tell you where you're falling behind because they don't want to have an uncomfortable conversation.
  - They don't remember or didn't notice some of your accomplishments.
  - They pile undesirable work on the person who doesn't complain about it.
  - They resent you for complaining about undesirable work.
  - They brush you off when they're stressed.
  - They get defensive when you share your ideas for improving their work.
- Learn about the manager
  - What are their goals?
  - What are their pet peeves?
  - What keeps them up at night?
  - What is their leadership philosophy?
  - What's their favorite management book?
  - What's their highest priority project?
  - What side projects are they passionate about?
- Make sure your manager knows how your work is going.
  - Here's what's happening.
  - Here's how I'm handling it.
- When you make a request, frame it in terms of benefits to your team or company. Ask about ways to improve your skills rather than bringing up promotions.
- Soliciting feedback:
  - Be transparent about the areas you're working on . If people know that you're aware you need to work on something, it's easier for them to point it out. For example, "I'm working on clearer communication, so if I say anything that's unclear, can you please let me know so that I can explain it differently?"
  - Frame the request as "What would the next level look like?"

# Interviews

- The most challenging part for me was that, as a product manager, I essentially had all the details and numbers and the roadmap and the vision at my fingertips. But now as a people manager, I didn't know anything. It was a hard transition because I was so comfortable when I had all the details. I had to learn how to rely on others.
- What I learned there is to never say, "this is how we did it at company X." You just have to bite your tongue. It was really about going in and not saying anything for a month. Just quietly observe and really soak everything up that's going on in the organization.
- When you start to grow from one team to feature teams, having a shared language and shared rituals is so important. The whole idea behind product reviews or design reviews is to have a regular and predictable venue that people can count on to have a conversation.
- One of the hardest changes for the team was not operating from a center of fear. This was a group of people that had become comfortable with losing. I changed this to say, "No, no, you have to change your mentality to how we are going to win today. Let's take some risks. Let's be bold." To do that, you get some quick wins. You show progress. Get credibility. There's easy ways to do that. Be very clear about what you're going to do and how you're going to do it. Then remind everybody. And then remind them again.
- With eBay, it was much more of a business-driven product management approach, where you would do things like write the business case and work with your business partners to figure out the actual revenue opportunity. At Google, our collaboration was much more around finding the interesting tech problems. Technology and engineering were much more the center of how decisions and products were launched at Google.
- When you're in management, if necessary, you should roll up your sleeves and get stuff done. That opens up paths that you might not have been thinking of. As an example, at Google I helped some leaders with a roadmap process. The work was basically spreadsheet gymnastics and it didn't seem ideal for how far I was into my career. But, I was making myself useful. That got me exposure to start working on larger agency products for AdWords.
- Your career is going to take you to different places, but the best thing you can do is to lean into the strengths of the company you're at. If your company is world class at something, then you should become world class at that thing. You can springboard your career off the back of that competency.
- Instagram: I believe over the long term that kind of decision-making—based on product principles and real jobs to be done by users—pays dividends, because the product feels more intentional and less spammy. Another thing that made this a great outcome was that the team was very small and there was no pressure. It was counter-intuitive, but the smaller team effectively allowed us and forced us to focus on what really mattered.
- Growth is effectively a product group that focuses on what we call the adjacent user.
  - Instead of the power user, it's the person who is struggling to adopt the product.
  - In order to build for them, you need to build products in a way that really solves pain points for people at every step.
  -When I arrived, the team had just shipped a new registration flow and was planning to move on to the next thing. I convinced them that we needed to change those plans by showing them how there was so much more work to be done.
  - We ended up working on improving registration really intensely for 18 months. I sat down with people and showed them how to think about each step from the lens of the adjacent user.
  - I explained the importance of implementing logging.
  - We brainstormed around the drop-off on each step. We went over the difference between things that were practical versus beautiful. I helped build reinforcing communication structures so we would learn from whatever we launched.
  - At the beginning of that time, 65% of people who started registration completed it. We got it up to 95%, which is huge for a registration flow that has 1.5 million people going through it a day.
- Early in your career, you really need to build a lot of muscle around product sense and building things that have clear user value and solve jobs to be done in a simple and impactful way for users.
- For mid-career PMs, two things matter: the ability to create and get buy-in around a great strategy and the ability to drive cross functional influence.
- Another challenge is finding a sponsor. The notion of becoming a sponsor is predicated on pattern matching for people who look like you. What I've learned is that I need to ask for sponsorship.
- Finally, focus on the people more than the results. Focus on how you can help the engineers and designers you're working with every day to be successful. Focus on how you can help the other product managers be successful. It's not just about the success you achieve; it's about how you help other people achieve success.
- When I joined Flipkart, I saw that nobody had time to look through all the user flows and connect the dots. So, I thought of myself as two things:
  - The fluid that connects all of the different areas: business, engineering, leadership, strategy, and so on.
  - The subject matter expert on e-commerce.
- The complexity with food delivery is that not only do you need to match buyers, sellers, and drivers in real time, but there are also millions of product combinations as well. You have a perishable commodity that is deteriorating with time. You might think you want to eat pizza, but end up buying pasta. The platforms which are most successful are the ones which don't only get you to what you want to buy, but also what the platforms need to sell.
- For example, with e-commerce, there are seven big areas, including search, reviews, and payments. You can spend six months going deep into each area. Every quarter, when we discuss the review scores of product managers on my team, I'm looking to see them dive deep in a field.
- As a PM, you're both very creative and very scientific at the same time. You break down observations into why and how they happened, which leads to insights.
- A single insight can lead to multiple hypotheses (how can I use this insight to change behaviour?). A single hypothesis could be (in)validated through different experiments or roll-outs. Experiments lead to more observations. It's a loop!
- The first thing is realizing there's so many different kinds of PM roles, and really trying to figure out which one's right for you.
  - A builder is your classic feature PM, responsible for taking an existing product and coming up with new features to delight the end user. The builder is about talking to and delighting customers. It's really about the customer experience.
  - A tuner PM is an optimization PM, like a growth or monetization PM. It's much more analytically rigorous and is higher velocity in terms of A/B tests. It's much more about the metrics. If you love being a builder PM, you might not like being a tuner PM.
  - The innovator PM is about building a brand new product for a new audience. There's a lot of uncertainty in being an innovator. Your project might fail. Maybe the audience was wrong. A lot of people try it and realize they're happier as a builder with more clear wins.
  - Even if your aspiration is to be an innovator PM, start as a builder PM. Early in your career, it's important to get some wins under your belt. I've met PMs that worked at three startups and none of them became household names. Now they're struggling to get that role in a larger company. Innovation roles don't do much to help build your credibility as a successful PM unless they succeed.
  - The final dimension is the size of the company. At a small company you do a lot of the pieces yourself. At a large company, you have a UX writer, a UX researcher, a product marketer. You spend a lot more time on coordination.
- I started as a frontend developer and designer and moved to a design and product management role. I came in and said I want to talk to customers and figure out what we should be doing. Our VP of product management was impressed and started bringing me into the executive meetings. I got firsthand exposure to the finances and was involved in M&A conversations.
- To know if you'd be good at coaching, it's a little bit of a gut check of how much you can set aside your ego. The term "servant leadership" is becoming trendy, and a bit jargon-y, but I feel like the concept behind it is really good. If I'm working with a product team, my role as a coach is to serve them in whatever way I can. That's very different from a traditional training mindset of "I have my method that I'm going to stamp onto you."
- Guiding the career:
  - The first is brand. It is governed by the companies you've worked for. In my case, it's ex-Microsoft, ex-Atlassian, ex-Bridgewater. People recognize those names, they have a certain expectation of people who've gone through them. If you're an immigrant, if you're a woman, if you're black, if you're an outsider of the power dynamics, it's even more important.
  - The second is reputation . That's about you. What have you shipped? What have you built? What are you saying on Twitter? What are you saying on Medium? What are you saying on LinkedIn? What do people know you for? What are they endorsing you for? That is your own thing, and you have to guard it.
  - Money.
- Slack: I built up the platform using all the skills that I'd gained in my previous roles, like engineering and business development.
  - Just launching features into the world is never enough for a platform. You need to have a business development team that goes and works with the largest companies to bring them on board.
  - You need a developer relations team that helps bring the broader ecosystem along and helps people understand what's possible with the technology. You need a platform marketing team and somebody that can help translate all of this to your end customers.
- Growth for PM?
  - The first is that you identify adjacencies to the part of the product you're responsible for. You identify new greenfield opportunities for products that amplify or extend what you're already doing. Over time you're sort of giving yourself a promotion because you're convincing the organization that they should invest in something bigger.
  - The second, which is more of a GM path, is to identify that there are other things the organization needs to do, beyond building the product, that are going to improve the ROI for that investment.
    - I advise people to get good at writing job specs for jobs they'll never take. When you need a marketing partner, write a marketing spec being very clear about what you need. Then use that spec to start a conversation or even start the search yourself with a list of candidates to talk to. Sometimes you'll end up being the person to hire them, and now that's a new experience that you have.
  - The third is that you can create connections cross-functionally . Particularly in an enterprise business, you need to spend time selling customers, closing customers, and dealing with them when they're upset. Almost as important is spending time with the sales team. You need to really have empathy for what it's like for them to go out and sell the product and market it, even when it might have some real gaps.

# Types of PM Roles

- ***B2B.*** You build a product or service that people find valuable, and they pay you for it. It's relatively straightforward to learn about what customers want from your product, and to know that you're delivering real value. Unless engineers or designers are the target customer, the team usually relies heavily on the PM to understand customer needs.
  - B2B product managers often focus on success metrics that measure revenue: getting people to pay and continue to pay. This might be measured by new sales deals your features helped close, annual recurring revenue (ARR), or active premium users, especially with a focus on retention and churn. At a zoomed-in level, PMs often focus on engagement with their features.
  - As a B2B PM, it's critically important to think about multiple users—the people who purchase or administer the software often have different needs than the people who use the software. Great products need to consider all of the users.
  - Strategic skills like market analysis and understanding business models are especially important for B2B product managers. PMs need to figure out what it takes to close deals, beat the competition, expand the market, and balance investments across many competing priorities. Unlike some consumer PMs, B2B PMs don't have the luxury of ignoring monetization.
- ***Platforms and Infrastructure.***
  - As a platform PM, you'll need to think about at least two levels of customers: the developers using your platform and the end-users they serve. The level of indirection also adds uncertainty: The product teams might change their goals or have failed to communicate their full context. Platform PMs generally try to measure platform health, such as the number of successful products using the platform.
  - For example, a poorly designed API might be missing access to a key object or might require too many round trips to be fast enough for the desired use cases. A great rule of thumb for platform PMing is to design around three different products you'd like to see built on top of the platform. Choosing at least one ensures the platform will actually be useful, and expanding it to three helps illuminate areas where the platform needs to be flexible.

## Interview Questions

- Define yourself.
  - Prepare honest answers that show you're a strong match for the role. Rehearse your answers until you don't ramble under pressure. Great pitches don't just explain how you got from point A to point B, but rather, they explain why you did.
- Behavioral questions.
  - To prepare, master five key stories that best represent why you're a great PM candidate. These are the stories that you'll try to fit in whenever you have a chance. This is where you get to demonstrate your "wow factor."
  - Leadership/influence, teamwork, successes, challenges/conflict, mistakes/failures.
  - Problem, epiphany, action, result, learning.
- Estimation questions.
  - Step 1: Clarify the question
  - Step 2: Catalog what you know (or wish you knew)
  - Step 3: Make an equation
  - Step 4: Think about edge cases and alternate sources
  - Step 5: Break it down
  - Step 6: Review and state your assumptions
  - Step 7: Do the math
  - Step 8: Check the answer to see if it's reasonable
- Product questions.
  - Favorite products: Prepare at least 5 different products in advance so you don't freeze, or have to start from scratch when they ask you to choose a product.
- Case questions.
- Technical questions.

# Networking for Introverts

- In new relationships, don't ask for too much too soon; this is a common mistake. Don't ask new contacts for coffee in your first interaction and never explicitly ask them to become your mentor. Instead, ask for their email and reach out within a day or so with a quick question they can answer via email, such as:
  - "I loved the point you made yesterday about finding the heat for products. Do you have an example of a feature that wouldn't have existed without this approach?"
- Pick a cadence to regularly reach out to a new contact based on the person's availability—e.g., monthly or quarterly. After two or three interactions, new contacts will expect you to continue reaching out and will start seeing the interactions as the start of a relationship. It's human nature to invest in a relationship once you expect to consistently interact with a person in the future.
- Don't ask busy people to "catch up." Be specific in your ask and provide a concrete topic or decision for them to offer input.

# The Paradox of Autonomy and Recognition

- There is no objective, quantifiable way that exists for me to be able to do this at scale without resorting to micromanagement—which is not something you even want to contemplate with a talented team.
- Trust is like a currency; when a manager gives their reports autonomy and independence, they are trusting them to complete the assigned task—making wise and strategic decisions along the way—and proactively communicate problems long before they become a problem.
- For someone to invest in you, you have to show you are in fact an investment.
  - Does your boss trust you?
  - Do your team and your peers trust you?
  - Have you done a good job to earn their trust?
  - How would your peers describe you to someone else?
  - How influential are you within your organization?
- In my project, the one thing Josh did differently was he didn't just do the work, but he made sure that the management—my boss and the GM—knew what our team was doing.
  - In retrospect, he was the reason our project was recognized in an organization with so many people. At the time I resented Josh; now, many years later, I realize that his contributions to our team wasn't just his code, but his communication and the way he did his job .

# 10 Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer

- Rule #1 of negotiating: have everything in writing. Eventually, they'll give you information about the offer. Write it all down. Doesn't matter if they're going to send you a written version later, write everything down. Even if there are things that are not directly monetary, if they relate to the job, write them down. If they tell you "we're working on porting the front end to Angular," write that down. If they say they have 20 employees, write that down. You want as much information as you can. You'll forget a lot of this stuff, and it's going to be important in informing your final decision.
- This leads to rule #2 of negotiating: always keep the door open. This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating. Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, or tie you to a decision you didn't commit to. You must keep verbally jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you're actually ready to make your final decision.
- Rule #3 of negotiating: information is power. When you say, " can you do 90K instead of 85K ," you've told them exactly what it will take to make you sign. The sheet's pulled back, the secret auction is up, and they're going to bid 90K (or more likely, 87K). And they know there's almost no risk in doing so, because you'll probably accept.
- Staying positive is rule #4 of negotiation.
  Companies are terrified of that. They don't want their candidates to go bad during a negotiation. Hence why they hire professional recruiters to manage the process and make sure they remain amicable. You and the recruiter share the same interest in that regard.
  - If a company feels like you've gone bad, suddenly they're a lot less willing to pay for you.
  - So despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you're still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out.
  - Generally, the most convincing way to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they're working on, and really want to see things work out.
- Rule #5 of negotiation: don't be the decision-maker.
  - I'll look over some of these details and discuss it with my `[FAMILY/CLOSE_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT_OTHER]`. I'll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I'll be in touch!
  - It's much harder to pressure someone if they're not the final decision-maker. So take advantage of that.
  - When I wrote about the story of my own job search, 3 I mentioned how having an offer from Google made companies turn around and expedite me through their funnels. Many commentators lamented at the capriciousness of these companies. If Uber or Twitch only talked to me because of Google and until then weren't willing to look at me, what did that say about their hiring processes? What legitimately are they evaluating, if anything at all?
- Why Companies Care About Other Offers
  - First, you must realize what a company's goal is. A company's goal is to hire someone who will become an effective employee and produce more value than their cost. How do you figure out who will do that? Well, you can't know for certain without actually hiring them, but there are a few proxies.
  - Pedigree is the strongest signal; if they did it at other companies, they can probably do it at yours. And if someone trusted within the organization can vouch for them, that's often a strong signal as well.
  - But it turns out, almost everything else is a weak signal. Weak in the sense that it's just not very reliable. Interviews, if you think about it, are long, sweaty, uncomfortable affairs that only glancingly resemble actual employment. They're weird and can't tell you that much about whether an individual will be good at their job. There's no way around this.
  - There are a few stronger signals, like bringing someone in for a week or two on a contract-to-hire position, but strong candidates won't consider this. So candidates as a whole have effectively forced companies to assume almost all of the risk in hiring.
  - The truth is, knowing that someone has passed your interview just doesn't say that much about whether they'll be a good employee. It's as though you knew nothing about a student other than their SAT score. It's just not a lot of data to go off. Nobody has solved this problem. Not Google nor anyone else.
