# Inspired

## Lessons from Great Tech Companies

- State of the art was very different from the state of the practice.
- Most product leaders also want to create inspiring and successful products. But most products are not inspiring, and life is too short for bad products.
- Behind every great product is someone who led the product team to combined technology and design to solve real customer problems in a way that meets the needs of the business.
- Most products today are transforming into technology-powered products, and the companies that don't realise these are rapidly being disrupted.
- Tech world: startups, growth-stage, enterprise companies.
  - Startup: A new product company that has yet to achieve product/market fit. The reality is you want to achieve PM-fit before you run out of money.
  - Good startups are optimised to learn and move quickly.
  - Growth-stage: 25-several hundred engineers. You start hearing "technical debt". Leaders need to change their roles and their behaviours.
  - Enterprise: Must have consistent product innovation.
- Root cause of failure:
  - While almost everyone today claims to be Agile, the whole ideas -> costing -> design -> engineering is very waterfall.
  - Figuring out how much it costs - without knowing the actual solution, and without building it, it's hard for engineering to predict.
  - Inconvenient truths about product: At least half of ideas are just not going to work. Good teams assume that at least 3/4 of their ideas won't perform like they hope. There are several iterations to get the implementation of this idea to the point where it delivers the necessary business value.
  - Gathering and documenting requirements is more project that product management.
  - Big missed opportunity: engineering gets brought in way too late. If you're just using your engineers to code, you're only getting half their value.
  - This entire process is project-centric - projects are output and product is about outcome.
  - Customer validation is at the end - many teams believe they're applying lean principles, yet they follow this basic process I've described.
- The best product teams:
  - Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end. Risks: value risk (whether customers will buy), usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it), feasibility risk (whether engineers can build what we need with the time/skills/tech), and business viability.
  - Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.
  - Solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output. Strong teams know it's not only about implementing a solution, it's about biz results.

## Concepts of Modern Product Work

- Holistic product: tech, UX, monetisation, how we attract/acquire users and cx, offline experiences (ex: merchandise fulfillment and merchandise return for e-commerce).
- We are always working in parallel to both discover the necessary product to be built while the engineers work to deliver production-quality product. Engineers are also helping daily on discovery + PM/design are also helping daily on delivery.
- Product discovery:
  - Will the user buy this?
  - Can the user figure out how to use this?
  - Can our engineers build this?
  - Can our stakeholders support this?
- Prototypes: *to set expectations, strong teams normally test many product ideas each week - like 10-20 or more per week.*
- Product vision: Long-term objective of this product, normally 2-10 years out.
- MVP - should never really be an actual product (where a product is defined as something that your developers can release with confidence, that your customers can run their business on, and that you can sell and support).

## The Right People

- *A product team is a group of people who bring together different specialised skills and responsibilities and feel real ownership for a product, or at least a substantial piece of a larger product.* We need missionaries, not mercenaries.
- Usually, everyone on a product team is an individual contributor, and there are no people managers.
- Team collaboration: usually in the same room, same area. There is a special dynamic when the team sits together, eats lunch together, and builds personal relationships with one another.
- Autonomy: They are able to try to solve the problems they are assigned in the best way they see fit.
- Why like this? Collaboration is built on relationships, and product teams are designed to nurture these relationships. To innovate, you need expertise. Also, the product team needs to understand the business objectives and context. And most important, the full team feels ownership and responsibility for the outcome.
- The PM
  - A PM job is very demanding and requires a strong set of skills and strengths. PM needs: tech sophistication, business savvy, credibility with execs, cx knowledge, passion for the product, respect of the product team.
  - What needs to get built: product backlog. *On the best teams, engineers and designers want to see some evidence that what you're asking to build is truly worth building.*
  - Knowledge of the data: analytics tools, what's happening here, both sales and usage analytics?
  - Knowledge of the market/industry: competitor, trends, cx behaviour/expectations, following the relevant industry analysts.
- ***Must be the very best versions of smart, creative, and persistent.*** Smart = intellectually curious, quickly learning and applying new tech to solve problems for customers, to reach new audiences, or to enable new business models.
- PM role is not a 9-5 job. It's pretty much bad for work-life balance. To prepare for your role:
  - *Become an expert in your users and customers. Share very openly what you learn, both the good and the bad. Become your team's and your company's go-to person for understanding anything about the customer-quantitative and qualitative.*
  - *Work to establish a strong relationship with your key stakeholders and biz partners.*
  - Become an undisputed expert on your product and your industry. Again, share your knowledge openly and generously.
  - Work hard to build and nurture the strong collaborative relationship with your product team.
- Takeaway:
  - PM is super different from the other disciplines. There is some project management. You're like a CEO but you're not the boss of anyone.
  - Like a CEO, the product manager must deeply understand all aspects of the biz.
  - The winning solutions didn't come from users, cx, sales - rather, it came from collaboration with design and engineering to solve real problems for your users and cx.
- Product owner
  - The person responsible for the product backlog.

## Product Designer

- Old model: designers took requirements or specifications from product managers and used that to create their designs.
- New model: Product designers continuously collaborate with PMs and engineers, from discovery to delivery.
- *Rather than being measured on the output of their design work, the product designer is measured on the success of the product.*
- They are deeply oriented around actual customers and the value their product brings to those customers.
- They also understand that the product is in service of a business and incorporate those constraints into the design of the product.
- User experience: any way that cx and end users realise the value provided by your product. It includes all the touch points and interactions a cx has with your company and product over time.
  - This means: e-mail, marketing campaigns, sales process, cx support, offline services like a car summoned through Uber.
- Good product designers think about the customer's journey over time as they interact with the product and with the company as a whole.
  - How will cx first learn about the product?
  - How do we onboard a first-time user?
  - How might users interact at different times during their day?
  - What other things are competing for the user's attention?
  - How might things be different for a one-month-old cx vs a one-year-old cx?
  - How will we motivate users to a higher level of commitment to the product?
  - How will we create moments of gratification?
  - How will a user share his experience with others?
  - How will cx receive and offline service?
  - What is the perceived responsiveness of the product?

- The Absence of Product Design
  - You as PM do the actual design itself.
  - You as PM don't provide the design but provide high-level user stories to the engineers.
  - You as PM provide the interaction design but use a visual/graphic designers to provide the visual design.
- Most products for businesses have awful design - this is because the user is so not often the customer, they are the one that buys.
- *We need design, not just as a service to make our product beautiful, but to discover the right product.*
- In strong teams today, the design informs the functionality at least as much as the functionality drives the design. For this to happen, we need to make the designer a first-class member of the product team, sitting side-by-side with the PM, and not a supporting service.
- Here are five keys to a successful and healthy relationship with your designer:
  - Do whatever you need to do to have your designer sit next to you.
  - Include your designer from the very inception of every idea.
  - Include your designer in as many cx and user interactions as possible. Learn about the users and cx together.
  - Give your designer as much room as possible to solve the design challenges him or herself.
  - *Encourage your designer to iterate early and often. The best way you can encourage this is to not get nitpicky about design details. Encourage your designer to feel free not just to iterate on the design approach but to explore alternative solutiosn to the problem.*

## The Engineers

- Engineers are smart and skeptical by nature, so if you're bluffing, they likely won't be fooled. If you don't know something, better to just say you don't know, rather than try to bluster.
- *It's hugely important that you have an actual appreciation for the demands and complexity of the engineering job.*
- You want to involve them deeply in the cx pain you are trying to solve and in the biz problems you face.

## Product Marketing Managers

- Coming up with winning products is never easy. We need a product that our cx love, yet also works for our biz.

## Jane Manning of Google

- Product solution for `Adwords`: They would place it to the side, so they wouldn't be confused with the salesperson-sold ads, which were displayed on the top of the results. The formula = the most relevant would go the top (those with high click-through-rate).
- In the products that succeed, there are people behind the scenes who work to get over each and every one of the objections - technical, business, and anything else.

## People at Scale

- Leader of product design: at least one person must review everything going on with the product that is going to be visible to the user.
- Leader of technology organisation: engineering manager + director + software architects.
- If your projects have conflicting user models and poor usability, then you might need a head of design or principal designer.
- If projects are stuck because PMs don't understand the implications of their decisions, then we're probably missing a principle product manager.

## Head of Product Role

- Organizationally, this role typically manages the product managers and product designers, sometimes the data analysts, and generally reports to the CEO. With some exceptions, it is important that this role be a peer to the CTO and the VP marketing.
- Competency:
  - Develop a strong team of product managers. Recruiting, training, and ongoing coaching.
  - Great organisation. A strong product culture means that the team understands the important of continuous and rapid testing and learning. They understand that they need to make mistakes in order to learn, but they need to make them quickly and mitigate the risks.
  - Strong technical background + economics/dynamic of the biz and your market.

## Principles of Structuring Product Teams

- Investment strategy.
- Critical contest: Overall product vision, specific business objectives assigned to each team.
- Adobe Head of Product - moving from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud/subscription-based.

## The Right Product

- Outcome vs output.
- Product roadmap: Prioritised list of features and projects your team has been asked to work on.
- Half of our product ideas are just not going to work. And even those ideas that are good need several iterations to get the execution of this idea where it delivers the expected business value that management was hoping for - time to money.
- Product discovery - if we can prototype and test ideas with users, customers, engineers, and business stakeholders in hours and days, rather than weeks and months, it changes the dynamics, and most important, the results.
- Components that provide the business context:
  - The product vision and strategy - the big picture of what the organisation as a whole is trying to accomplish and what the plan is for achieving that vision.
  - Biz objectives - specific, prioritised business objectives for each product team. It's management's responsibility to provide each product team with the specific biz objectives they need to tackle.
- High-integrity commitments: By this date, we have this deliverable.
- Grief on commitments? It's when these commitments are made. They are made too early, before we know whether we can deliver on this obligation, and whether what we deliver will solve the problem for the customer.
- ***Product vision should be inspiring, and the product strategy should be focused.***

## Principle of Product Vision

- Start with why.
- Fall in love with the problem, not with the solution.
- Don't be afraid to think big with vision.
- Don't be afraid to disrupt yourselves, because if you don't, someone else will.
- The product vision needs to inspire. We need product teams of missionaries, not mercenaries. More than anything else, it's the product vision that will inspire missionary-like passion in the organisation.
- Determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends.
- Figure out where things are heading, not where it is.
- Stubborn on vision, flexible on details.
- Any product vision is a leap of faith.
- Evangelise continuously and relentlessly.

## Principle of Product Strategy

- One target at a time.
- Align with biz strategy.
- Align with sales and go-to-market strategy.
- Obsess over cx, not competitors.
- Communicate the strategy across the organisation.

## Product Objectives

- Management by objectives, not management by control. Objectives, key results.
- Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
- When performance is measured by results. You can release all the features you want, but if it doesn't solve the underlying business problem, you haven't really solved anything.

## OKR Technique

- Objectives should be qualitative, but key results need to be quantitative/measurable.
- KR should be a measure of business results, not outputs or tasks.
- PM, design, tech - focus on the organization's objectives and the objectives for each product team, which are designed to roll up and achieve the organisation's objectives.
- 1-3 key results for the organisation and for each team.
- Product team tracks their active progress per week.
- Objectives should cover what the team needs to accomplish.
- Teams should feel accountable to achieving their objectives.
- High-integrity commitment.

## Product Team Objectives

- When organisations first start with OKRs, there's a common tendency to have each functional department create their own OKRs. Better to focus your OKRs at the product team level.

## Product Evangelism

- Selling the dream, using a prototype.
- Share the pain - show the team the cx pain you are addressing. This is why it's good to bring engineers along for cx visits and meetings.
- Share the vision - make sure you have a clear understanding of your product vision, product strategy, and product principles. Show how your work contributes to this vision and is true to the principles.
- Share learnings generously - share the things that went well, but share the problems, too.
- Learn how to give a great demo. We are trying to show them the value of what we are building. A demo is a persuasive tool. Get good at it.
- Be genuinely excited, show some enthusiasm.

## The Right Process

- Discovery - We need to make sure we come up with a single solution that works for many customers, and not a series of specials. To do this, we need to be able to test out many ideas, and we need to do this quickly and inexpensively.
- We need to learn fast, yet also release with confidence.
- Purpose of product discovery:
  - Will the cx buy this, or choose to use it?
  - Can the user figure out how to use it?
  - Can we build it?
  - Does this solution work for our business?
- ***Cx doesn't know what's possible with tech products until we actually see it.*** Historically, in the vast majority of innovations in our industry, the cx had no idea that what they now love was even a possibility.
- We want to establish compelling value.
- Old waterfall model - the market drove this functionality, which drove the design, which drove the implementation.
- We must validate our ideas on real users and cx.
- We need to validate the feasibility of our ideas during discovery, not after. If the first time your developers see an idea is at sprint planning, you have failed. Not only does this end up saving a lot of wasted time, but it turns out that getting the engineer's perspective earlier also tends to improve the solution itself, and it's critical for shared learning.
- Validate the business viability of our ideas during discovery, not after.
- Shared learning:

## Discovery Techniques

- Framing: Ensure that the team is all on the same page in terms of clarity of purpose and alignment, identify the risks. Teams tend to gravitate toward a particular type of risk they are most comfortable with.
- Types of risks:
  - Financial risk: Can we afford?
  - Biz dev risk - Does this solution work for our partners?
  - Marketing - Is this solution consistent with our brand?
  - Sales - Can we sell this?
  - Legal
  - Ethical

## Story Map

- How can the teams know how one story fits in with the big picture?
- Product market fit - checking that people are using your product.
- Concierge technique - you just do the customer's job for them, and see if that solves the problem.

# Testing Business Viability

- Kate Arnold from Netflix - flat monthly fee was great, but they changed the code to have the queue, rating system, recommendations engine.
- Discovery sprint, discovery coaches.
- Designing strong products - results in a design by committee, which yields mediocre results at best. Instead, meet privately with each stakeholder, show them the high-fidelity prototype, and give them the chance to raise any concerns.
- Intentional product culture - having it so well-established that when new hires join, they know they're joining a different type of company that takes pride in how they work and in using best practices.

# Good Product Team, Bad Product Team

- Good teams have a compelling product vision that hey pursue with a missionary-like passion. Bad teams are mercenaries.
- Good teams get their inspiration and product ideas from their vision and objectives, from observing cx struggle, from analyzing the data cx generate from using their product, from constantly seeking to apply new tech to solve new problems. Bad teams gather requirements from sales and cx.
- Good teams understand who each of their key stakeholders are, understand the constraints, and are committed to inventing solutions that work not just for users and customers, but also work within the constraints of the business. Bad teams gather requirements from stakeholders.
- Good teams know how to rapidly try out product ideas to determine which ones are truly worth building. Bad teams hold meetings.
- Good teams have brainstorming discussion with smart thought leaders from across the company. Bad teams get offended when someone outside their team dares to suggest they do something.
- Good teams have product, design, and engineering sit side by side, and they embrace the give and take between the functionality, the user experience, and the enabling technology. Bad teams sit in their respective silos, and ask that others make requests for their services in the form of documents and scheduling meetings.
- Good teams are constantly trying out new ideas to innovate, but doing so in ways that protect the revenue and protect the brand. Bad teams are still waiting for permission to run a test.
- Good teams insist they have the skill sets on their team, such as strong product design, necessary to create winning products. Bad teams don't even know what product designers are.
- Good teams ensure that their engineers have time to try out the prototypes in discovery every day so that they can contribute their thoughts on how to make the product better. Bad teams show the prototypes to the engineers during sprint planning so they can estimate.
- Good teams engage directly with end users and customers every week, to better understand their customers, and to see the customer's response to their latest ideas. Bad teams think they are the customer.
- Good teams know that many of their favorite ideas won't end up working for customers, and even the ones that could will need several iterations to get to the point where they provide the desired outcome. Bad teams just build what's on the roadmap, and are satisfied with meeting dates and ensuring quality.

## Top Reasons for Loss of Innovation

- No cx-centric culture. Cx are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, and they want you to invent on their behalf.
- No compelling product vision. When the original product vision was realised and the team is struggling to understand what's next.
- No focused product strategy. Don't try to please everyone at once.
- No strong product managers.
- No stable product team.
- No engineers in discovery.

## Top reasons for Loss of Velocity

- Technical debt.
- Lack of strong product managers - when the team becomes mercenaries rather than missionaries.
- Lack of delivery management.
- Infrequent release cycles - should release no frequently than every two weeks (good teams release multiple times per day). Be serious about test automation and release automation.
- Lack of product vision/strategy.
- Lack of co-located, durable, product teams.
- Consensus culture.

## Establishing a Strong Product Culture

- Culture of experimentation.
- Culture of open minds.
- Culture of tech.
- Culture of business and cx-savvy teams.
- Culture of skill-set and staff diversity.
- Culture of discovery tech.
- Culture of urgency - move fast.
- Culture of high-integrity commitments.
- Culture of empowerment - teams have the tools, resources, and permission to do whatever is necessary to meet their commitments.
- Culture of accountability - people and teams feel a deep responsibility to meet their commitments.
- Culture of collaboration.
- Culture of results.
- Culture of recognition.
