# Inspired

## Lessons from Great Tech Companies

- State of the art was very different from the state of the practice.
- Most product leaders also want to create inspiring and successful products. But most products are not inspiring, and life is too short for bad products.
- Behind every great product is someone who led the product team to combined technology and design to solve real customer problems in a way that meets the needs of the business.
- Most products today are transforming into technology-powered products, and the companies that don't realise these are rapidly being disrupted.
- Tech world: startups, growth-stage, enterprise companies.
  - Startup: A new product company that has yet to achieve product/market fit. The reality is you want to achieve PM-fit before you run out of money.
  - Good startups are optimised to learn and move quickly.
  - Growth-stage: 25-several hundred engineers. You start hearing "technical debt". Leaders need to change their roles and their behaviours.
  - Enterprise: Must have consistent product innovation.
- Root cause of failure:
  - While almost everyone today claims to be Agile, the whole ideas -> costing -> design -> engineering is very waterfall.
  - Figuring out how much it costs - without knowing the actual solution, and without building it, it's hard for engineering to predict.
  - Inconvenient truths about product: At least half of ideas are just not going to work. Good teams assume that at least 3/4 of their ideas won't perform like they hope. There are several iterations to get the implementation of this idea to the point where it delivers the necessary business value.
  - Gathering and documenting requirements is more project that product management.
  - Big missed opportunity: engineering gets brought in way too late. If you're just using your engineers to code, you're only getting half their value.
  - This entire process is project-centric - projects are output and product is about outcome.
  - Customer validation is at the end - many teams believe they're applying lean principles, yet they follow this basic process I've described.
- The best product teams:
  - Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end. Risks: value risk (whether customers will buy), usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it), feasibility risk (whether engineers can build what we need with the time/skills/tech), and business viability.
  - Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.
  - Solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output. Strong teams know it's not only about implementing a solution, it's about biz results.

## Concepts of Modern Product Work

- Holistic product: tech, UX, monetisation, how we attract/acquire users and cx, offline experiences (ex: merchandise fulfillment and merchandise return for e-commerce).
- We are always working in parallel to both discover the necessary product to be built while the engineers work to deliver production-quality product. Engineers are also helping daily on discovery + PM/design are also helping daily on delivery.
- Product discovery:
  - Will the user buy this?
  - Can the user figure out how to use this?
  - Can our engineers build this?
  - Can our stakeholders support this?
- Prototypes: *to set expectations, strong teams normally test many product ideas each week - like 10-20 or more per week.*
- Product vision: Long-term objective of this product, normally 2-10 years out.
- MVP - should never really be an actual product (where a product is defined as something that your developers can release with confidence, that your customers can run their business on, and that you can sell and support).

## The Right People

- *A product team is a group of people who bring together different specialised skills and responsibilities and feel real ownership for a product, or at least a substantial piece of a larger product.* We need missionaries, not mercenaries.
- Usually, everyone on a product team is an individual contributor, and there are no people managers.
- Team collaboration: usually in the same room, same area. There is a special dynamic when the team sits together, eats lunch together, and builds personal relationships with one another.
- Autonomy: They are able to try to solve the problems they are assigned in the best way they see fit.
- Why like this? Collaboration is built on relationships, and product teams are designed to nurture these relationships. To innovate, you need expertise. Also, the product team needs to understand the business objectives and context. And most important, the full team feels ownership and responsibility for the outcome.
- The PM
  - A PM job is very demanding and requires a strong set of skills and strengths. PM needs: tech sophistication, business savvy, credibility with execs, cx knowledge, passion for the product, respect of the product team.
  - What needs to get built: product backlog. *On the best teams, engineers and designers want to see some evidence that what you're asking to build is truly worth building.*
  - Knowledge of the data: analytics tools, what's happening here, both sales and usage analytics?
  - Knowledge of the market/industry: competitor, trends, cx behaviour/expectations, following the relevant industry analysts.
- ***Must be the very best versions of smart, creative, and persistent.*** Smart = intellectually curious, quickly learning and applying new tech to solve problems for customers, to reach new audiences, or to enable new business models.
- PM role is not a 9-5 job. It's pretty much bad for work-life balance. To prepare for your role:
  - *Become an expert in your users and customers. Share very openly what you learn, both the good and the bad. Become your team's and your company's go-to person for understanding anything about the customer-quantitative and qualitative.*
  - *Work to establish a strong relationship with your key stakeholders and biz partners.*
  - Become an undisputed expert on your product and your industry. Again, share your knowledge openly and generously.
  - Work hard to build and nurture the strong collaborative relationship with your product team.
- Takeaway:
  - PM is super different from the other disciplines. There is some project management. You're like a CEO but you're not the boss of anyone.
  - Like a CEO, the product manager must deeply understand all aspects of the biz.
  - The winning solutions didn't come from users, cx, sales - rather, it came from collaboration with design and engineering to solve real problems for your users and cx.
- Product owner
  - The person responsible for the product backlog.

## Product Designer

- Old model: designers took requirements or specifications from product managers and used that to create their designs.
- New model: Product designers continuously collaborate with PMs and engineers, from discovery to delivery.
- *Rather than being measured on the output of their design work, the product designer is measured on the success of the product.*
- They are deeply oriented around actual customers and the value their product brings to those customers.
- They also understand that the product is in service of a business and incorporate those constraints into the design of the product.
- User experience: any way that cx and end users realise the value provided by your product. It includes all the touch points and interactions a cx has with your company and product over time.
  - This means: e-mail, marketing campaigns, sales process, cx support, offline services like a car summoned through Uber.
- Good product designers think about the customer's journey over time as they interact with the product and with the company as a whole.
  - How will cx first learn about the product?
  - How do we onboard a first-time user?
  - How might users interact at different times during their day?
  - What other things are competing for the user's attention?
  - How might things be different for a one-month-old cx vs a one-year-old cx?
  - How will we motivate users to a higher level of commitment to the product?
  - How will we create moments of gratification?
  - How will a user share his experience with others?
  - How will cx receive and offline service?
  - What is the perceived responsiveness of the product?

- The Absence of Product Design
  - You as PM do the actual design itself.
  - You as PM don't provide the design but provide high-level user stories to the engineers.
  - You as PM provide the interaction design but use a visual/graphic designers to provide the visual design.
- Most products for businesses have awful design - this is because the user is so not often the customer, they are the one that buys.
- *We need design, not just as a service to make our product beautiful, but to discover the right product.*
- In strong teams today, the design informs the functionality at least as much as the functionality drives the design. For this to happen, we need to make the designer a first-class member of the product team, sitting side-by-side with the PM, and not a supporting service.
- Here are five keys to a successful and healthy relationship with your designer:
  - Do whatever you need to do to have your designer sit next to you.
  - Include your designer from the very inception of every idea.
  - Include your designer in as many cx and user interactions as possible. Learn about the users and cx together.
  - Give your designer as much room as possible to solve the design challenges him or herself.
  - *Encourage your designer to iterate early and often. The best way you can encourage this is to not get nitpicky about design details. Encourage your designer to feel free not just to iterate on the design approach but to explore alternative solutiosn to the problem.*

## The Engineers

- Engineers are smart and skeptical by nature, so if you're bluffing, they likely won't be fooled. If you don't know something, better to just say you don't know, rather than try to bluster.
- *It's hugely important that you have an actual appreciation for the demands and complexity of the engineering job.*
- You want to involve them deeply in the cx pain you are trying to solve and in the biz problems you face.

## Product Marketing Managers

- Coming up with winning products is never easy. We need a product that our cx love, yet also works for our biz.

## Jane Manning of Google

- Product solution for `Adwords`: They would place it to the side, so they wouldn't be confused with the salesperson-sold ads, which were displayed on the top of the results. The formula = the most relevant would go the top (those with high click-through-rate).
- In the products that succeed, there are people behind the scenes who work to get over each and every one of the objections - technical, business, and anything else.

## People at Scale

- Leader of product design: at least one person must review everything going on with the product that is going to be visible to the user.
- Leader of technology organisation: engineering manager + director + software architects.
- If your projects have conflicting user models and poor usability, then you might need a head of design or principal designer.
- If projects are stuck because PMs don't understand the implications of their decisions, then we're probably missing a principle product manager.

## Head of Product Role

- Organizationally, this role typically manages the product managers and product designers, sometimes the data analysts, and generally reports to the CEO. With some exceptions, it is important that this role be a peer to the CTO and the VP marketing.
- Competency:
  - Develop a strong team of product managers. Recruiting, training, and ongoing coaching.
  - Great organisation. A strong product culture means that the team understands the important of continuous and rapid testing and learning. They understand that they need to make mistakes in order to learn, but they need to make them quickly and mitigate the risks.
  - Strong technical background + economics/dynamic of the biz and your market.
