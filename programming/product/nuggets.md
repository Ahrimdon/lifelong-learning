# Fresh Start Effect
[Reference](http://coglode.com/gem/fresh-start-effect)

- We motivate ourselves into good habits by using a new week, month, year, or national holiday marker to put past behavior behind us and focus on being better.
- Higher likelihood to go to the gym at the beginning of a new week, month, semester, as soon after term breaks, and after birthdays.
- We see our current and past selves as being separable, and we often compare them to one another.
- We tend to view our past selves in a way that flatters our current one. "New year, new me."
- *Because we try to maintain a consistent self image, seeing our current self as superior will inspire decisions that are themselves consistently superior.*
- Takeaways:
  - Create a campaign across different time scales. You can advertise during fresh start moments such as just before the start of the week, month, and year.
  - Fitness and diet brands focus on large yearly campaigns in January.
  - Highlight the "new you". "Have a healthy new year. Sign up for our New Year's Offer."
  - Possibly just one fresh start advert may be sufficient to motivate behavior change.
  - When January comes, you can: use the last year's contribution as an anchor, use a strategy that works upon the desire to feel superior to the past self, as well as being consistent with our decisions.

# Present Bias

- An online grocery shopping study suggests that as the days go down prior to delivery of an order, the % made up of essentials decreases and the % made up of desirables increases. The closer to the present moment, the less less rational we become (though only up to a point!).
- If the lead time is longer, we'll buy better food.

# Temptation Coupling

- If you're busy, like listening to audiobooks and need to work out at the gym, doing both of these things at once can save you considerable amounts of time.
- People actually preferred it if the iPod was only accessible at the gym.
- Takeaways:
  - You can put your loyalty stamps on the healthier meals.
  - Add deeply-entrenched customer desires to succeed.
  - App access on certain areas only?
  - Add a feedback mechanism to garbage cans when you do something favorable.

# Cognitive Miser

- *Our judgment is often biased because we minimize cognitive effort and intuitively substitute the harder questions for the easier ones.* A key question is whether or not people realize that they are doing this and notice their mistake.
  - Also note that the effect seems to be most effective when we assume the maths to be so absurdly simple that no slow, thoughtful calculations are needed. Use this with complex pricing at your peril!

# Peak-end Rule
[Reference](http://coglode.com/gem/peak-end-rule)

- Negative occurrences in any consumer interaction can be counteracted by establishing a firmly positive peak & end. Make the customer experience start and end in the store a nice one.
- A great salesperson who helps with an exchange can erase negative experiences along the way.
- If things go wrong, allow flexibility, humility, and an opportunity to save the relationship.
