# From engineering to product management, and back again
[Reference](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2020/07/23/from-engineering-to-product-management-and-back-again/)

- Product management can be distilled down into two tasks:
  - Ensuring the right feature/product is being built for your users.
  - Doing whatever it takes to make ^ happen.
- *Make sure your users are getting the right product. This would involved talking to users to understand their needs, analyzing product usage data/working with your team and stakeholders to create the next great feature.*
- Ambiguity
  - As an engineer, the thinking will be limited to the systems and the codebase, and thinking about how to use them to build products.
  - The actual output of PM doesn't feel like work.
  - As a PM, you might spend your time reading up on user feedback, whole day in meetings talking about the same thing with different groups of people. "Was I busy or did I get something done today?"
- *I worked through that by keeping a detailed journal. No one else can see this, but it was just so I could keep track of what I was doing.*
- High Output Management - a core output of my job is to communicate with others.
- Systematically remove any and every roadblock getting in the way of shipping a great product.
- Data paralyzed vs data informed
  - 70% confidence could be good enough to make a call. *I didn't always know what the exact impact of a feature would be, but I knew enough to know that whatever we were doing had the highest impact out of anything on the table.*

## Focus on Users

- Why are other products compelling? How did a product meet users' needs? How did it delight them? Where did it fall short? What would I do to improve it?
- *Engineering communication requires precision and clarity of thought. If you can't express your idea in words, you can just write that thought out in code and other engineers will get it.*
- How to write a good document, how to run a meeting, how to craft a compelling story, how to be just the right amount of direct, how to be the right amount of concise.
- Learning how to say no kindly and empathetically is an art form. But in general, it's best done by clearly communicating priorities and correctly setting expectations in the first place so that people don't come with requests that won't get fulfilled. Doing that involves educating your coworkers on how the product prioritization process works, socializing your product roadmap and spending lots of time to answer questions.
- In general, my favorite days at work have been when I do a blend of people / business work and creative technical work. I enjoyed the strategic and people-focused work of product management but I missed making things and technical problem solving. While I did get to exercise technical thinking as a product manager it was rarely a good use of my time to go deep.

## Developer Experience

- The faster you can move the more quickly you can create the ideal product your users want, which in turn dictates how successful your product will be. Gains in engineering efficiency snowball into massive benefits for users over time.
- *That's led me to start seeing our developer experience as part of our product. It's much more than just our toolkit -- it's the end-to-end cycle of working with a designer and product manager to understand product requirements to building the feature to shipping it and monitoring in production.*
