# Consulting Organizations vs. Product Organizations
[Reference](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consulting-organizations-vs-product-shanif-dhanani/)

- ***In consulting organizations, the employee is the product.***
  - Because of this, both employees and owners of consulting organizations are always concerned with "billability", or working on something that they can charge the client for.
  - Employees are rewarded more for finding new clients, rather than doing great work.
  - Those that can sell tend to rise up the ranks and gain more prominence.
  - Those that can't may still be respected, but end up lacking the ability to make a lot of changes and set policies.
- ***Product-focused firms, though, make money by creating and selling things that they create.***
  - They're more focused on building great products, and because of that, they don't have to worry about accounting for how their employees spend each and every hour while at work.
  - What they need to focus on is delivering high quality products that their customers actually want to buy.
  - *This means that they're more incentivized to foster employee happiness and creativity. It also means the employees of a product organization need to work in close proximity for large amounts of time.*
  - This need for creativity and the close cooperation of employees inevitably leads to a corporate culture and identity among its employees. Organizations that care about their culture are then able to drive and direct this culture to one that makes their employees happy (which, arguably, leads to employees sticking around longer and doing better work).

# Are your SaaS customers paying, or praying?
[Reference](https://productcoalition.com/are-your-saas-customers-paying-or-praying-e23021301c78)

- If your Product Team doesn't handle requests from praying customers correctly, it will put your startup at risk of becoming nothing but a feature factory.
- Geoffrey Moore, the absence of a market: “If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market.”
- In SaaS, two customers belong to the same market if and only if they use your product to serve their customers in a similar way.

# Product Managers, Let’s Embrace Deep Work
[Reference](https://productcoalition.com/product-managers-lets-embrace-deep-work-fae03061d6d4)

- Most high value work = thinking about product vision and strategy, piecing together various forms of input to figure out priorities, looking at product from different angles, preparing for major meetings to make sure they are productive, competitive review.
- Work that is best done in large chunks of time, uninterrupted, and without a worry that you need to respond to each and every Slack question.
- Pick the right work: What's the ONE THING you can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?
  - Product strategy: Are we actually doing the right thing?
  - Expressing/clarifying vision in a way that makes sense
  - Processing/acting on user feedback
  - Thinking deeply about upcoming work: Clarifying/adding meaning to user stories.
- To make sure I get deep work done:
  - "Why would I ever want to let myself down and not make it to our appointment on time and with full energy?"
  - Finding a place where I won't be disturbed.
  - Finding a time where I can focus and have energy to do this right.
  - The norms: shut down emails, write down goals, what I'm allowed to access, have a place to capture Todos.
  - If I get stuck, I walk, drink coffee, not check email.
- Maker's schedule vs manager's schedule.
  - When work is at a naturally low time: usually right after lunch. Involve only people who will have a role in the meeting.
