# Consulting Organizations vs. Product Organizations
[Reference](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consulting-organizations-vs-product-shanif-dhanani/)

- ***In consulting organizations, the employee is the product.***
  - Because of this, both employees and owners of consulting organizations are always concerned with "billability", or working on something that they can charge the client for.
  - Employees are rewarded more for finding new clients, rather than doing great work.
  - Those that can sell tend to rise up the ranks and gain more prominence.
  - Those that can't may still be respected, but end up lacking the ability to make a lot of changes and set policies.
- ***Product-focused firms, though, make money by creating and selling things that they create.***
  - They're more focused on building great products, and because of that, they don't have to worry about accounting for how their employees spend each and every hour while at work.
  - What they need to focus on is delivering high quality products that their customers actually want to buy.
  - *This means that they're more incentivized to foster employee happiness and creativity. It also means the employees of a product organization need to work in close proximity for large amounts of time.*
  - This need for creativity and the close cooperation of employees inevitably leads to a corporate culture and identity among its employees. Organizations that care about their culture are then able to drive and direct this culture to one that makes their employees happy (which, arguably, leads to employees sticking around longer and doing better work).

# Are your SaaS customers paying, or praying?

- If your Product Team doesn't handle requests from praying customers correctly, it will put your startup at risk of becoming nothing but a feature factory.
- Geoffrey Moore, the absence of a market: “If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market.”
- In SaaS, two customers belong to the same market if and only if they use your product to serve their customers in a similar way.
