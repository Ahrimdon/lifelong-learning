# Consulting Organizations vs. Product Organizations
[Reference](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consulting-organizations-vs-product-shanif-dhanani/)

- ***In consulting organizations, the employee is the product.***
  - Because of this, both employees and owners of consulting organizations are always concerned with "billability", or working on something that they can charge the client for.
  - Employees are rewarded more for finding new clients, rather than doing great work.
  - Those that can sell tend to rise up the ranks and gain more prominence.
  - Those that can't may still be respected, but end up lacking the ability to make a lot of changes and set policies.
- ***Product-focused firms, though, make money by creating and selling things that they create.***
  - They're more focused on building great products, and because of that, they don't have to worry about accounting for how their employees spend each and every hour while at work.
  - What they need to focus on is delivering high quality products that their customers actually want to buy.
  - *This means that they're more incentivized to foster employee happiness and creativity. It also means the employees of a product organization need to work in close proximity for large amounts of time.*
  - This need for creativity and the close cooperation of employees inevitably leads to a corporate culture and identity among its employees. Organizations that care about their culture are then able to drive and direct this culture to one that makes their employees happy (which, arguably, leads to employees sticking around longer and doing better work).

# Are your SaaS customers paying, or praying?
[Reference](https://productcoalition.com/are-your-saas-customers-paying-or-praying-e23021301c78)

- If your Product Team doesn't handle requests from praying customers correctly, it will put your startup at risk of becoming nothing but a feature factory.
- Geoffrey Moore, the absence of a market: “If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market.”
- In SaaS, two customers belong to the same market if and only if they use your product to serve their customers in a similar way.

# Product Managers, Let's Embrace Deep Work
[Reference](https://productcoalition.com/product-managers-lets-embrace-deep-work-fae03061d6d4)

- Most high value work = thinking about product vision and strategy, piecing together various forms of input to figure out priorities, looking at product from different angles, preparing for major meetings to make sure they are productive, competitive review.
- Work that is best done in large chunks of time, uninterrupted, and without a worry that you need to respond to each and every Slack question.
- Pick the right work: What's the ONE THING you can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?
  - Product strategy: Are we actually doing the right thing?
  - Expressing/clarifying vision in a way that makes sense
  - Processing/acting on user feedback
  - Thinking deeply about upcoming work: Clarifying/adding meaning to user stories.
- To make sure I get deep work done:
  - "Why would I ever want to let myself down and not make it to our appointment on time and with full energy?"
  - Finding a place where I won't be disturbed.
  - Finding a time where I can focus and have energy to do this right.
  - The norms: shut down emails, write down goals, what I'm allowed to access, have a place to capture Todos.
  - If I get stuck, I walk, drink coffee, not check email.
- Maker's schedule vs manager's schedule.
  - When work is at a naturally low time: usually right after lunch. Involve only people who will have a role in the meeting.

# So, You Want To Become a Great Product Manager?
[Reference](https://www.nirandfar.com/becoming-a-product-manager/)

- The most surprising thing I've learned is how many people get told they need to “be more strategic” and have no idea what that means. It's incredibly common feedback, but people don't get actionable advice on how to address it.
- When you want to break into Senior PM roles, being a great PM is no longer just shipping products that delight customers and hit the goals. You enter the phase of your career where being a great PM means identifying new opportunities and coming up with strategies to win the market. It's a brand new responsibility.
- The most broadly applicable lessons are: 1) start with the goals and 2) validate your ideas. If you just follow those two guidelines, you'll see a huge improvement in the success of your work.
- We tend to come up with an idea and rush to start building it without reflecting on the problem we're trying to solve. If we slowed down just a bit, we might realize that there's a more important problem to solve, or a better way to solve the same problem.
- At work, I often want to build V2 of a feature, but when I go back to my goals (more people using the feature), I realize a better approach is to improve the discoverability of V1. Personally, I went 5 years in my career before I stopped to really think about my career goals. I'd absorbed an idea around getting promotions and salary increases, but when I paused to reflect, I realized that wasn't the only option. Once I had that epiphany, I decided to join a startup with a lower salary and no job title.
- Validating ideas is a powerful technique that requires a real mindset shift. Instead of trying to be the person with the best ideas, try to be the person who's the best at learning which ideas are promising. The greatest product thinkers don't get their ideas right on the first try all the time, but they do test their ideas with real people and quickly discard the bad ones. They're also not just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see which ideas stick. Instead, they form a robust mental model with hypotheses about what a successful solution looks like.
- Roughly, I think about the stages like this:
  - Getting ideas out of my head
  - Iterating by myself
  - Iterating based on feedback from a coworker
  - Iterating based on feedback from my real target audience.
- Now, I do a first pass where I write every idea down in the order it comes to me. It usually feels like I have lots of thoughts swirling in my head, but they're blurry until I write them down. I've gotten better at catching myself when I start to wordsmith too early. The goal is to get the ideas out as fast as possible.
Career ladders are frequently misleading. They show a rubric that maps a large number of skills and behaviors to levels, and many people think “okay, if I study this guide and work on these skills I'll be promoted.”
- The thing is, you don't need all those skills to get promoted! And, you won't always get promoted even if you have them. The rubric isn't a checklist of how to get promoted, it's just a set of examples and descriptions of what people who already reached that level look like.
- In reality, promotions aren't about skills, but rather scope, autonomy, and impact. You get a promotion when you show that you can deliver impactful work at the next higher scope, without too much help. For product managers, you get promoted when you ship successful products.

# 3 Types of Product Management: Which One is Right For Your Company?
[Reference](https://medium.com/earnest-product-management/3-types-of-product-management-dec4b2d77271)

- Common explanation: UX + Tech + Business.
- The ambiguity of the product management role is near to its essence - within one company, the duties of a product manager can change drastically and quickly.
- User-first product manager
  - Design background. Like optimising for speed, bug fix, comprehension, user requests.
- Business-first product manager.
  - Profits, features, biz dev, growth, investor requests.
- Technology-first product manager.
  - Prototyping, task management, workflow diagrams.
  - De-scoping, feature re-use, minimising obsolete work, extensibility, consistency with technical semantics.
- ***The dimensions of performance within a product category will change over time. Canonically, hard drive capacity mattered more than physical size up until the time that capacity reached a certain maximum usefulness.***

# Writing Technical User Stories
[Reference](https://medium.com/tribalscale/writing-technical-user-stories-434bf96f1dd5)

- Good story?
  - Independent - can be built separately to other stories.
  - Negotiable - requirements can be adapted.
  - Valuable - provides benefit to the end-user.
  - Estimable - to reasonable accuracy.
  - Small - can be built within one iteration.
  - Testable - can be verified by QA.
- Feature slicing:
  - Features should be sliced vertically, not horizontally, to break them into stories.
  - Focus on end-to-end user value, not by front-end tasks vs back-end tasks.
  - Splitting: Features like single search term vs multiple search terms, sorting vs searching.
- Happy and unhappy paths - think about this with the user.
  - Create, read, update, delete.
  - States: Waiting, empty, error, success, limits, and default values.
  - Configuration options - Filtering, sorting, searching, pagination, include (what related information can also be returned in the response).
- If an API is the product, then the routes, method, request, and response definitions are the business requirements.
