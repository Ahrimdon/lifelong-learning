# Chapter 11, Define Yourself

- The pitch: Background, experiences, and interests. When possible, connect elements of your pitch to what the company is looking for, whether that's aspects of the PM role or the company's product.
- Be mindful of how long you speak. 2 minutes.
- Do highlight the most interesting or relevant parts of your jobs. This is your opportunity to sell yourself.
- Don't just list off your accomplishments.
- Don't get overly technical. It's great if you have some very technical experience, but your interviewer wants to hear in more straightforward language why that work was important.
- Discuss your extra-curricular activities, if it is related. These can show initiative and leadership.
- Do practice.
- Don't speak too abstractly.
- Don't be boring and rattle off a bunch of facts about yourself, weave your pitch into a mini-story.
- Do be passionate and proud of your past work.

"Second, as a CS major and statistics minor, I have the technical and quantitative background that you're looking for." I haven't done a lot of data analysis in my current role, but I have the academic background and raw skills to learn it quickly."
 - *Show that you know how to do the job well, and that he's offered information to compensate for what an interviewer might perceive as a gap in his expertise: data analysis. List specific, concrete accomplishments that wouldn't otherwise appear on his resume.*
