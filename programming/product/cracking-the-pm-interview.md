# Chapter 11, Define Yourself

- The pitch: Background, experiences, and interests. When possible, connect elements of your pitch to what the company is looking for, whether that's aspects of the PM role or the company's product.
- Be mindful of how long you speak. 2 minutes.
- Do highlight the most interesting or relevant parts of your jobs. This is your opportunity to sell yourself.
- Don't just list off your accomplishments.
- Don't get overly technical. It's great if you have some very technical experience, but your interviewer wants to hear in more straightforward language why that work was important.
- Discuss your extra-curricular activities, if it is related. These can show initiative and leadership.
- Do practice.
- Don't speak too abstractly.
- Don't be boring and rattle off a bunch of facts about yourself, weave your pitch into a mini-story.
- Do be passionate and proud of your past work.

- ***Why do you want to work here?***
  - Research about the company or position. Doing research shows passion for the position.
  - Relevant experience: "I'm really interested in testing tools."
  - Passion: "I think your company has the potential to bring these online resources to a much broader community."

- ***Why should we hire you?***
 - Why are you a good PM?
 - Why are you a good fit for this space?
 - Why are you a good fit for this company's culture or work environment?
 - "I have several years of experience as a PM, and I've consistently shown success in the role. I've launched four critical features from scratch in that time..." "Second, as a CS major and statistics minor, I have the technical and quantitative background that you're looking for." I haven't done a lot of data analysis in my current role, but I have the academic background and raw skills to learn it quickly."
 - *Show that you know how to do the job well, and that he's offered information to compensate for what an interviewer might perceive as a gap in his expertise: data analysis. List specific, concrete accomplishments that wouldn't otherwise appear on his resume.*

- ***Why are your leaving your current job?***
  - "To be honest, I'm actually pretty happy in my current role, but I stumbled across this job opening..."
  - No need to blabber, 1-3 sentences.

- ***What do you like to do in your spare time?***
  - Exploring new tech.
  - Online learning.
  - Volunteering for the animal shelter.
  - "I read a lot. I love playing ultimate frisbee. I'm the lead singer and primary songwriter for a punk rock band."

- ***Where do you see yourself in five years?***
  - To test your ambition.
  - To see if the company can give you what you want.

- ***What are your strengths and weaknesses?***
  - Strengths: Specific, relevant, and can be supported with evidence.
  - Weaknesses: Actual weakness. "I can sometimes get distracted at work. Sometimes, I am stubborn in my decision making and to use a sports analogy, play hero-ball."

# Chapter 12, Behavioral Questions

- Validate that your resume matches up with your experience.
- Behavioral questions allow an interviewer to "dive deep" into your prior experiences.
- How have you made an impact?
- Tell me about a challenging problem you faced: If you haven't had professional wins and losses, then many would argue that you haven't really done much at all.
- "Tell me about a time when you've had to convince a manager of something." â†’ How and why you influence people when you lack power.

## Communication

- Nugget first. "I'll tell you about the time I had an underperforming teammate."
- Situation, Action, Result (SAR).
  - Why this thing mattered.
  - Why we did the action.
  - How did we help the team or the company.
- Speak in Bullets.

## Preparation Grid

- Come up with situations for this:
  - Leadership
  - Teamwork
  - Successes
  - Challenges
  - Mistakes
  - Failures

- Master Five Key Stories.
  - These should all have a situation, action, and result.
  - Make sure that each of those stories had a meaty situation, action, and result. (Don't just send an email, lol.)
  - A good part of making stories understandable is how you deliver them.
- What do you want to show about yourself?
  - Are you creative? Are you well-liked within your company? Are you good at building teams? Understanding? A good leader? Are you analytical? Determined and ambitious? A risk taker? Good at minimizing risks? Technical?
- Common topics:
  - Leadership & Influence
  - Challenges
  - Mistakes/failures
  - Successes
  - Teamwork
- Types of Behavioral Questions
  - Leadership/Influence: Gathering data, understanding/addressing people's underlying motivations or incentives. Developing support from team members first, and then leveraging that to get other people on your side.
  - Challenges: Ethical dilemmas, insufficient resources, incomplete information, low morale. How'd you fix? Gathering data, leveraging the support and expertise of people around you, discussing and setting team priorities, understanding the emotions of those around you, thinking about the right thing to do, breaking down the emotion
  - Failure: Sell yourself as a failure. They want to see how you had a big failure, that you can admit failure, and you can handle it.
  - Successes: Something you're proud of accomplishing. Reaching a goal that was important. A specific insight you gained from something outside of work. A time you went above and beyond the call of duty. A time you resolved a situation before it became too serious.
  - Teamwork: Striking compromises, finding ways of making teammates feel valued. Understanding what things are suboptimal for you in the interest of the greater team good. Relinquishing egos. Setting common goals. Balancing autonomy with team cohesion.

# 13: Estimation Questions

- Catalog what you know.
- Make an equation.
- Edge cases and alternate sources.
- Break it down.
- Review and state assumptions.
- Do the math.
- Sanity check.

# 14: Product Questions

- Designing a Product: Start with a structured approach that starts with the user. It's not about what you want the product to be, it's about what the user wants.
  - You need to make sure you understand what the question is. It might not be what you think.
- First I'll talk about the goals. Then, I'm going to list out some potential features. Finally, I'm going to evaluate each of those features against the goals. Okay, so starting with these goals...
- Identify the users and customers.
- Use cases, what are their goals.
- What are the limitations of their current product for their use cases? Are there obvious weak spots?
- What features or changes would improve those weak spots?
- Wrap things up.
- TODO: Read.

## Preparation

- Select products: An online product, offline product, product you purchased recently, your "favorite" product or website.
- Understand key metrics: users/traffic, conversion, referral, engagement, retention, revenue, costs.
- Analyze each product: users and goals, strengths, challenges/focus, why, priorities and values, competitors, trade-offs.

- Tips and Tricks
  - Have an opinion.
  - "Wow" the interviewer.
  - Use the whiteboard.
  - Don't overbuild. Be realistic about what can and can't be built, and what the trade-offs are.
  - Don't complain about research. You can say about how you research things.
  - Think about the business, too.
  - Be open about the trade-offs: Some candidates try to pass off their product as the best idea.
