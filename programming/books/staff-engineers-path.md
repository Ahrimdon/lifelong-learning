# Introduction

- Either manager (with direct reports) or technical leader without reports (staff engineer).
- What did people above "senior" do all day?
- Pillars of staff engineer:
  - Big-picture thinking.
  - Execution of projects.
  - Levelling up the engineers you work with.
- Human skills:
  - Communication and leadership
  - Navigating complexity
  - Putting your work in perspective
  - Mentorship, sponsorship, and delegation
  - Framing a problem so that other people care about it
  - Acting like a leader whether you feel like one or not

## Chapter 1 - What Would You Say You Do Here?

- Why do titles matter? We want to help people understand they are progressing and communicating an expected competency level to the outside world.
- Local maximum: "The best decision for a single group which may not be the best decision when you take a broader view".
- Usually, the murky/difficult parts of the project involve spelunking through legacy code, negotiating with busy teams that don't want to change anything, and divining the intentions of engineers who left years ago.
- One way to keep a project moving is to have someone who feels ownership for the whole thing, rather than any of its individual parts.
- Staff engineers: responsible for ensuring resulting systems are robust and fit well with the technology landscape.
- You are not a manager, but you are a leader. "Someone should do something here" - that someone is you.
- As your compensation increases and your time becomes more expensive, the work you do is expected to be more valuable and have a greater impact.
- Leadership: Reviewing other engineers' code, teaching, quietly raising everyone's game, setting technical direction.
- Technical role - reviews of code or designs should be instructive for your colleagues and should make your codebase or architecture better.
- You know you're supposed to be working on things that are impactful and valuable. But what are those high-impact work that you should be doing? "You create it!"
- Discipline needed in any job in the world:
  - Core technical skills - coding, cooking, whatever
  - Product management - figuring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work
  - Project management - the practicalities of achieving that goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what's blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked
  - People management - turning a group of people into a team, building their skills, mentoring etc.
- Aligning on scope, shape, and primary focus:
  - Here are my goals for this year.
  - Here are some sample activities that I will do.
