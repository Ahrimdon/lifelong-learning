## Assessing Your Own Experience

- Have you had a manager you considered good?
- How often do you meet 1-1 with your manager?
- Do you feel that you can tell your manager a life event?
- Has your manager delivered good feedback to you?
- Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this year?

- Does your organisation have tech leads? Is there a written job description for this role? If so, what does it say?
- If you are considering becoming a tech lead, are you ready to push yourself? Are you comfortable spending some of your time outside of the code? Do you feel like enough of an expert in your code base to successfully lead others as they work in it?
- Have you asked your manager what he or she expects from the tech lead?
- Who is the best tech lead you ever worked with?
- What are some things that person did that made him or her great?
- Have you worked with a frustrating tech lead? What did he or she do that frustrated you?

# Management 101

- The secret or managing is keeping the people who hate you away from the ones who haven't made up their minds.
- Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback.
- 1-on-1: they create human connection between you and your manager. *Being an introvert is not an excuse for making no effort to treat people like real human beings, however.* The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust. And trust, real trust, requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other. So, the manager will hopefully treat you like a human who has a life outside of work, and spend a few minutes talking about that life when you meet.
- Good 1-1s are not status meetings. Share the responsibility of having good 1-1s with your manager. Come with an agenda of things you would like to discuss.
- Feedback: Your manager needs to be your number one ally.
- Role of manager as the person who provides mentoring and training is not a universal expectation. In some companies, there is a training arm. *Your manager should have an idea of whether you are qualified to be promoted. If you're interested in being promoted, it's important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion.*
- Your manager can point out opportunities for growth. *What your want to do, what you want to learn, and what will make you happy rests on your shoulders.* Bring agendas to your 1-1s when you have things you need to talk about. When you want to work on projects, ask. Advocate for yourself. When your manager isn't helpful, look for other places to get help. When you're unhappy, say something. When you're stuck, ask for help.
- Your manager cannot force work-life balance on you. If you wanna go home, figure out how to get your work done and go home.

# Mentoring

- *People are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand.* When you're face to face with another person, interpret his body language and the way he's saying those words.
- Mentee - might not ask "stupid questions". Nervous about screwing the opportunity up.
- Mentor:
  - Be curious and open-minded. Working with new people who are learning things for the first time can shed light on these hidden patterns and help you make connections you may not otherwise have made.
  - Listen and speak their language. Software development is a team sport.

# Tech Lead

- Good communicator - can write documents, presentations, and could talk to people in different things and different roles and explain what was going on.
- Tech lead - continue to write code, but represent the group to management, vet the plans for feature delivery, and deal with details of the product management process.
- Standards:
  - Regular 1-1 touch bases.
  - Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted.
- A leader spends at least 30% of the time writing code with the team.
- *You need to be willing to step away from the code and figure out how to balance your technical commitments with the work your whole team needs.*
- Roles:
  - Systems architect and business analyst. How to design complex software. Also, how to understand biz requirements and translate them into software.
  - Project planner: what are the deliverables.
  - Team leader.
- Managing a project:
  - Start breaking down via spreadsheet.
  - Push through the details and the unknowns.
  - Run and adjust the plan as you go.
  - Use insights in planning to manage requirements changes.
- Tech lead: Communicate. You represent the team, communicate their needs, and bring information from that meeting back to the team.
