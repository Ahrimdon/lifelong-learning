[Reference](https://blog.stephanbehnke.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-job-hunt-in-toronto/)

- As part of my research I learned that most jobs are not found online, they can only be accessed through your network.
- No one replied re: sending out emails.
- Meetups + online community + recruiter + networking.
- Changes in the resume:
  - Highlight years of experience
  - Make it easy to see the skills section
  - Make sure each bullet point fits on a single line
  - Use colors to highlight different sections
- Hired.com works.
- Pre-screening: do your research, know what the company does, read their blog posts and explore their product, and use the "company expects these skills" and tell them you have those skills.
- Common questions:
  - Why us?
  - Tell me about yourself.
  - Biggest accomplishment?
  - Are you applying elsewhere?
  - Salary expectations?

## Lessons Learned

- Treat it like a sales pipeline.
- Talk to everyone.
- High-level matters. How to design systems, object relations, APIs.
- Side projects are not that helpful.
- Pick a stack.
- Be proud to talk about a project in depth.
- Leverage the opportunity to prepare. Have your code tools ready.
- Know complexity and scalability.
