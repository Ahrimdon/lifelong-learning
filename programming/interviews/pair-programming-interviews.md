- Interviewer: CV, resume, source code.
- Interviewee: Company site.
- Ask questions, work-related ones.
- No right or wrong answers.
- Let the candidate drive 90% of the time. Discuss the solution first.

# With a pair programming interview at Square just around the corner, how can one with a lack of experience in unit testing best prepare?

- Be familiar with your languages and your tools.
- Be prepared to debug and test.
- Talk.
- The questions you ask:
  - Do you have the basic skill we need to get the job done?
  - What gaps do you fill on the team?
  - Do I think you can get up to speed quickly on the things you don't know?
  - Do I want to work with you every day?
- Even if you don't do well, you gain because you learn how the do things and you learn a little bit of TDD and experience of pairing which is a wonderful way to work on code.
- So be honest with them. And again, keep positive, you'll learn something if not 10 things that day. It'll be invaluable to you I'm sure.
- If there is some Programming Dojo around, attending meetings could teach you much. Practising programming Katas on simple problems using strict TDD (one failing test, make the test pass, again) will also help. And of course practising TDD on real projects (open source ?).

- Study every day. Try to figure out how solutions come up.
- Practice on a whiteboard.
- Practice algorithms on Pramp, Interview Cake, Cracking the Coding Interview.
- Find a coding buddy.
- Expect and accept failure and keep trying. "How soon will I hear if I get the job or not?"

# How to get unstuck during a pair-programming interview

- What can you do when you’re stuck in front of an interviewer?
  - “Do what you would normally do when you get stuck coding,” Avielle says. Feel free to look up the documentation, google for answers, or look at source code for clues. Do what’s familiar. “The difference is that you’re talking it all out with the person,” Avielle adds.
- Explaining your process out loud is also recommended. Though it may feel awkward, Zach sees value in saying you are stuck. Expose your gaps in knowledge. Explain how you are trying to break down the problem. That’s encouraged!
