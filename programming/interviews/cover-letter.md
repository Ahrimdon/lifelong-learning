Dear Recruiter,
After looking at your website, which I discovered on glassdoor.com, I got the impression that Forty2 is a modern and dynamic company that enjoys taking on challenges. Therefore, I would like to apply as an Android developer, preferably starting in April 2017.

Android is exciting and has a really enthusiastic developer community. A little more than a year ago I started learning about it because I wanted to build something that is future orientated and easily accessible. Since then I have been developing mobiles apps privately (see https://github.com/DeveloperDavo) and have been continually teaching myself about it. I would enjoy bringing my skillset and enthusiasm to Forty2.

My passion for programming started while I started working as a research engineer. I found it so exciting that I decided to go through an intensive study period and change my career from structural
to software engineering.

During my internship at Company C I worked on a mobile app. Here I was able to gain a deeper knowledge of Android development and was able to directly contribute to the success of the scrum team and project. My self-taught skills and drive convinced Company C to offer me a permanent role upon completion.

I am currently working on a web application for one of Company C’s clients. In this project I have been able to learn how to write code efficiently in a team, improve legacy code and implement new features according to the client’s needs. I was also able to increase my expertise in Java and improve my understanding of how the layers of a large project come together. I would like to improve on these skills and learn new ones with Forty2.

With my determination, passion for software development and ability to adapt to new situations, I believe I am a good candidate as an Android developer at Forty2.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forwards to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely, Developer Davo
