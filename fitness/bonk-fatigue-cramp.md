## Bonking vs. Fatigue vs. Cramping: What You Need to Know
[Reference](https://runnersconnect.net/bonk-fatigue-cramp/)

### Bonking

- Bonking/hitting the wall is a term used to describe what happens when your body runs low on glycogen to burn as a fuel source.
- While your body can burn fat for energy, it tends to prefer glycogen.
- When your glycogen stores begin to run low, your body recognizes the potential danger and slows the body down gradually to conserve energy.
- At this point, you can still run, but your pace will begin to slow unless you increase your effort.
- However, if you continue, your glycogen stores will get so low that your body will basically shut down and even jogging will be almost impossible.
- *Bonking is not feeling tired; bonking is not an inability to move your legs faster. Bonking is when your glycogen stores get low enough that your brain shuts down your body.*
- A "true" bonk will almost always result in you not being able to physically run any longer.
- Anything that resembles running is likely out the window. More than likely, you'll feel dizzy or light-headed (and some runners feel nauseous).
- Preventing a true bonk: train yourself to burn fat more efficiently as a fuel source.
- Over-fueling is bad--your body can only process a finite amount of carb per hour. If you try to take in more carbs than you can handle, the digestive starts to shut down and you don't absorb anything.

### Fatigue

- This is what runners "mislabel" as bonking--getting tired.
- What causes this: muscle fatigue and damage to the muscle fibers.
- The damage to the muscle fibers reduce their ability to produce the powerful contractions needed to maintain marathon pace effort. It also causes that soreness and dead-leg feeling you get late in a race.
- As you begin to increase your effort to make up for the muscle damage, you begin to produce more lactate which interferes with your body's ability to clear hydrogen and results in a build-up of acid in the muscles.
- The more you have to rely on glycogen as a fuel source, the more the brain will signal your body to slow down.
- Not useful to run the full marathon distance in training due to how long it would take to recover.
- Accumulated fatigue--the fatigue from one workout accumulates and transfers to the next so that you're always starting a workout or a long run a little tired from your previous training.

### Cramping

- The research says that it's very clear that only a very small percentage of muscle cramps in runners are caused by fluid or electrolyte loss.
- Swimmers in very cold water can suffer from muscle cramping.
- Neither body weight changes (due to dehydration) not blood electrolyte levels were correlated with suffering cramps through a race.
- Most likely, these are "muscle overloading" or a fatigue cramp.
- These occur when the neural mechanisms that are supposed to inhibit muscle contraction are depressed and the chemical and electrical synapses that fire the muscle fibers is enhanced.
- Your slow twitch fibers get tired and you can no longer fire them as efficiently, then you try using intermediate fibers to help maintain pace, but these require more glycogen and are not as fatigue resistant as slow-twitch.
- Ex: when your glute muscle fatigues, your legs won't simply stop working. Instead, your brain tells your muscles, "this isn't getting the job done, let's fire the calves more forcefully to make up for the lack of power." Your calf isn't as strong or powerful as the glute, and it's not trained to handle this type of stress, so calf cramps. :(
- Preventing cramps:
  - *Improve form and posture.* Need to perform the strengthening exercises that target the mechanics that commonly deteriorate late in a race. Quad/calf cramps: perform drills that focus on improving your hip extension and posture.
  - *Simulate late race fatigue in the gym.* Morning session to lift heavy/maximize recruitment of muscle fibers. Then they come back for a second evening session where they use lighter weights/higher reps to blast their fatigued muscles. This stimulates tremendous growth.
