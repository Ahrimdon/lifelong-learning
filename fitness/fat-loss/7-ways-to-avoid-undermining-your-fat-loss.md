## Metabolism Massacre: 7 Ways To Avoid Undermining Your Fat Loss
[Reference](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/metabolism-massacre-7-ways-to-avoid-undermining-fat-loss.html)

- When you cut calories, your metabolism will start downshifting. The body uses calories simply through digesting/processing food.
- Once the body senses a loss of body fat, it will begin to lower thyroid levels and diminish nervous system output in an effort to stop the weight loss. Once further calorie cuts are made and cardio is increased, fat loss will resume again, and the body further lowers thyroid levels and nervous system output. It also lowers testosterone and raises cortisol (muscle loss) :(
- The body does this because if the body cut the calories, it would lose weight continuously until the guy died.

- *Practice patience.* Aim to lose no more than two pounds of fat per week, preferably closer to a rate of 1-1.5 pounds. This ensures that muscle loss is minimized.
- *Keep the carbs.* Carbs increase cellular hydration, and therefore cell volume. When muscle cells are hydrated and have greater volume, this signals the body that it is in a satiate state. The body, sensing it is fed, keeps the metabolic rate raised.
- *Utilize high-carb days.* Leptin: fat-burning hormone. Leptin serves many functions, including the control of energy expenditure. A high-carb day once every 4-8 days can boost leptin levels; leptin is highly responsive to glucose metabolism.
- *Don't cut fat too low.* Fatty acids must be available in the body to create cholesterol, which is eventually converted to testosterone. If fat intake is too low, there won't be enough fatty acids available for optimal testosterone production.
- *Reverse diet.* Where you add calories back into your diet slowly, much the same as when you cut them slowly in order to get lean.
- *Have a plan and stay informed.*
