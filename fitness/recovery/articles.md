## 17 Scientifically Proven Ways to Speed Recovery

- Sleep. Protein synthesis.
- Music. Relaxing tunes aid in exercise recovery.
- Protein before bed.
- Protein in the morning.
- Chocolate milk.
- Tart cherry juice and supplements might help reduce the swelling that occurs when muscles are damaged.
- Water.
- No booze.
- Foam rolling--the soreness occurs when our muscles and fascia (connective tissue running throughout the body) become knotted.
- Massage.
- Protein before workout.
- Protein post-workout.
- Daytime nap.
- Rest between days.
- Compression garments.
- Cold bath.
- Anti-inflammatory medications like turmeric and ginger, however if you're trying to build muscle, drugs like ibuprofen and aspiring may hinder muscle growth.

## Ride Hard, Recover Harder
[Reference](http://www.bicycling.com/training/fitness/ride-hard-recover-harder)

- Stress of training causes micro tears in your muscles.
- Body repairs your muscles, resulting in an inflammatory response (swelling/tenderness).
- Rebuilding process creates stronger muscles, but only if your body has time to heal.
- Some inflammation is good, but you don't want too much that you're too sore to ride.
- Active Rest: Rest doesn't mean doing nothing. Just do low-effort workouts to total rest on off/easy days to get blood circulating/reduce inflammation so you're primed for your next ride.
- Post-ride cooldown: Flushes out lactic acid.
- *A study in the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research found that when cyclists did a 15-minute cooldown spin at 30 percent of their VO2 max after a hard effort, they were able to perform almost as well 24 hours later on an identical strenuous workout.*
- Going embarrassingly slow: something like pedal to the coffee shop (doesn't have to be biking).
- Mental benefit to massage: lowers cortisol. Excess cortisol is linked to overtraining.
- Soaking in cold water: Reduces inflammation and soreness.
- Good post-ride recovery meals: four parts carbohydrate and one part protein. Yogurt, banana, berries, a bowl of cereal.
- Replace Na/K that were lost through sweat.
- Sleeping: Tour riders sleep 70 hours/week! No to alcohol, it prevents deep sleep.

## RECOVER FROM YOUR CYCLING
[Reference](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/knowledge/article/izn20130108-Sportive-R-R--Maximise-your-post-ride-recovery-0)

- Always end any ride with at least 10 minutes of easy Zone 1 riding to cool down.
- Elevate you legs after a hard ride by promoting lower body blood flow and it can prevent pooling.
- Compression clothing: anecdotal evidence says yes.
- Massage increases blood flow--try the foam roller routine?
- Don't train less than 2 hours before sleeping.
- Drink warm milk as it contains the sleepy chemical Tryptohan.
- Don't lie in bed worrying that you can't sleep.
- Stick to zone 1, anything more than this and you will be adding to your fatigue rather than enhancing recovery.

## Post-Run Recovery Tips
[Reference](http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-treatment/post-run-recovery-tips)

- We strain ourselves to go longer or faster than is comfortable. In so doing, we deplete our fuel sources and cause tears in our muscle tissue.
- Stimulated by the damage, our bodies adapt to this. Our stores open for maximum refueling, and our veins deliver white blood cells to repair the micro tears.
- So it's in the time between workouts that we become better athletes.
- Avoiding body shock: Move smoothly from a walk to the intended running pace, and back.
- Hilly run to recover from the tedium of a flat run, and a flat run to recover from the stress of a hilly run.
- For two hours post-workout, your body is trying to restock what it just burnt. So keep a recovery drink in hand, either in your car or gym bag.
- Emotional stress delivers a physical manifestation, if your muscles are clenched, they're not recovering, so take some time to relax.
- Recovery drink: 4-1 ratio of carbohydrate to protein.
- Don't do ibuprofen. Elevate your legs above your heart whenever you get a chance, take an ice bath and consume more anti-inflammatory foods.

## Recover Better to Run Faster

- "You are only as good as you recover."
- You need long runs, workouts, and weekly mileage, but if you can;t recover from those hard efforts, they aren't doing you much good.
- Day-to-Day Recovery: Compression apparel. Little lab data exists, but anecdotal evidence is a lot. Recovery footwear. Recovery nutrition: sports nutritionists recommend ingesting 200-300 calories. Or energy bar, sports drink.
-Recovery weeks: Training schedules are in four week blocks. These all conclude with a recovery week. 20-30 percent reduction in volume from the highest weekly total.
- Recovery block: 2-4 week periods of detraining. 2 per year, followed by 5 month cycle of training and racing. Each recovery period begins with no running whatsoever followed by two weeks of unfocused easy running.

## How to Optimize Your Recovery by Hydrating Properly
[Reference](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/optimize-recovery-hydrating-properly/)

- Recovery from exercise has a lot to do with homeostasis.
- When you lose fluid to the environment (through breathing, peeing etc.), your blood volume starts to drop. What happens: It makes your kidneys filter more of the water it processes back into the bloodstream, causing you to pee less, and it also makes you feel thirsty, so that you drink to top up your blood volume and to dilute the sodium levels in your blood plasma back down to normal.
- During a normal day when you don't exercise, the mount of water you lose through breathing can be as low as 1.6L per day.
- As soon as you exercise, this becomes around 1.2L per hour and it can reach as high as 3.5L for fit athletes working hard in hot climates.
- This is why competing in a Ironman or an ultramarathon can result in massive accumulated sweat losses.
- The average daily fluid requirement to maintain a healthy hydration status in the players was 12.2L.
- Sodium loss also.
- When your sweat losses have been fairly low and when you don't need to perform again for a while, simply drinking and eating normally is usually enough to replace all of the fluids and electrolytes you lost.
- High sweat losses: you need to drink around 1.5 times more fluid than you have lost, and you need to make sure there's plenty of sodium  either in or with the liquid.
- Your drinks need lots of sodium in them to prevent your blood sodium level from dropping too low, which according to the negative feedback loop, would cause your kidneys to significantly ramp up urine production, negating the effects of putting the fluid back in the first place.
- If you cramp up during the night after an intense workout, you can drink fluids containing sodium.
- We prefer to eat saltier soup in the hours after sweaty exercise.

## The Effects of Taking Sugar Out of Your Diet
[Reference](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/the-effects-of-taking-sugar-out-of-your-diet/)
[Reference](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/the-effects-of-taking-sugar-out-of-your-diet-part-2/)

- Our hypothesis is that endurance athletes, like us, who train 10 to 15 hours per week can see benefits in both performance as well as blood work by significantly reducing carb and sugar intake.
- Blood work:
  - Fasting blood sugar level
  - Triglycerides
  - HDL and LDL cholesterol
  - HemoglobinA1c (an estimate of blood sugar levels over the past two to three months)
  - Fasting insulin levels
  - TSH (as a screening test for hormonal stress from training, diet, lifestyle, etc.)
- 45 days later
  - No negative effects.
  - "Don't lose weight", so I added healthy fats as opposed to additional protein or carbohydrates.
  - The first 7-10 days without sugar were difficult: foggy head, sluggish, general malaise.
- Fat max measures the amount of fat an athlete is burning per minute at a certain intensity zone. The greatest amount of fat burned at an intensity is the athlete's fat max, and this is the training zone where they are the most efficient.
- This is the zone they will train in and race at in order to maximize their utilization of fat as their fuel.
- Despite the loss of sugar, blood sugar levels remained constant and healthy.
