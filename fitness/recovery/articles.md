## Ride Hard, Recover Harder
[Reference](http://www.bicycling.com/training/fitness/ride-hard-recover-harder)

- Stress of training causes micro tears in your muscles.
- Body repairs your muscles, resulting in an inflammatory response (swelling/tenderness).
- Rebuilding process creates stronger muscles, but only if your body has time to heal.
- Some inflammation is good, but you don't want too much that you're too sore to ride.
- Active Rest: Rest doesn't mean doing nothing. Just do low-effort workouts to total rest on off/easy days to get blood circulating/reduce inflammation so you're primed for your next ride.
- Post-ride cooldown: Flushes out lactic acid.
- *A study in the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research found that when cyclists did a 15-minute cooldown spin at 30 percent of their VO2 max after a hard effort, they were able to perform almost as well 24 hours later on an identical strenuous workout.*
- Going embarrassingly slow: something like pedal to the coffee shop (doesn't have to be biking).
- Mental benefit to massage: lowers cortisol. Excess cortisol is linked to overtraining.
- Soaking in cold water: Reduces inflammation and soreness.
- Good post-ride recovery meals: four parts carbohydrate and one part protein. Yogurt, banana, berries, a bowl of cereal.
- Replace Na/K that were lost through sweat.
- Sleeping: Tour riders sleep 70 hours/week! No to alcohol, it prevents deep sleep.

## RECOVER FROM YOUR CYCLING

- Always end any ride with at least 10 minutes of easy Zone 1 riding to cool down.
- Elevate you legs after a hard ride by promoting lower body blood flow and it can prevent pooling.
- Compression clothing: anecdotal evidence says yes.
- Massage increases blood flow--try the foam roller routine?
- Don't train less than 2 hours before sleeping.
- Drink warm milk as it contains the sleepy chemical Tryptohan.
- Don't lie in bed worrying that you can't sleep.
- Stick to zone 1, anything more than this and you will be adding to your fatigue rather than enhancing recovery.

## Post-Run Recovery Tips
[Reference](http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-treatment/post-run-recovery-tips)

- We strain ourselves to go longer or faster than is comfortable. In so doing, we deplete our fuel sources and cause tears in our muscle tissue.
- Stimulated by the damage, our bodies adapt to this. Our stores open for maximum refueling, and our veins deliver white blood cells to repair the micro tears.
- So it's in the time between workouts that we become better athletes.
- Avoiding body shock: Move smoothly from a walk to the intended running pace, and back.
- Hilly run to recover from the tedium of a flat run, and a flat run to recover from the stress of a hilly run.
- For two hours post-workout, your body is trying to restock what it just burnt. So keep a recovery drink in hand, either in your car or gym bag.
- Emotional stress delivers a physical manifestation, if your muscles are clenched, they're not recovering, so take some time to relax.
- Recovery drink: 4-1 ratio of carbohydrate to protein.
- Don't do ibuprofen. Elevate your legs above your heart whenever you get a chance, take an ice bath and consume more anti-inflammatory foods.

## Recover Better to Run Faster

- "You are only as good as you recover."
- You need long runs, workouts, and weekly mileage, but if you can;t recover from those hard efforts, they aren't doing you much good.
- Day-to-Day Recovery: Compression apparel. Little lab data exists, but anecdotal evidence is a lot. Recovery footwear. Recovery nutrition: sports nutritionists recommend ingesting 200-300 calories. Or energy bar, sports drink.
-Recovery weeks: Training schedules are in four week blocks. These all conclude with a recovery week. 20-30 percent reduction in volume from the highest weekly total.
- Recovery block: 2-4 week periods of detraining. 2 per year, followed by 5 month cycle of training and racing. Each recovery period begins with no running whatsoever followed by two weeks of unfocused easy running.
