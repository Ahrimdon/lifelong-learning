Abs: Are actually stabilizers. Sit-ups and crunches = bigger abs (gut of abs). When you lift anything in the gym, your abs are actually working already.

What to do: Walk at an incline. Walk at a regular pace.

Steroids = they enhance what you are doing. Steroids are literally nothing more than synthetic testosterone. When someone takes steroids, he's just increasing the amount of free testosterone floating around in his body. This leads to muscle growth/fat losses.

*When it comes to muscle growth and fat loss, testosterone is king, by a mile.*

Some people just have more testosterone levels, period. To maximize the testosterone output, I did:

- No more calories in/out. I built it around creating strategic "hormone cocktails" from exact combinations of food, fed at precise times, spaced throughout the day to maximize hormone creation and create a purely anabolic environment inside my body.
- Ignore calories in/out, use training that increases "anabolic environment" for maximum muscle growth/fat loss.
- Overtrain to manipulate hormone release and recovery.
- Abdominal stabilization hacks.
- *Absolutely no excuses, no compromises, no sacrifices. No "I feel like eating a slice of cake!"*
