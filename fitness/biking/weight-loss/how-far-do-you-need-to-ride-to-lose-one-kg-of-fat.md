## How far do you need to ride to lose 1kg of fat?

- Rough guide: Average watts * time in hours * 3.6, so 100 watts for two hours = 720 calories.
- 1kg of human fat tissue = 7800 calories.
- At 200 watts for one hour, it will take you 10.83 hours to burn 1kg of fat.
- If on a flat course at 200 watts with no wind, you can average 30kph, you have to ride 325km.
- Energy metabolism needs all available resources: you can burn 8000 calories, but not lose 1kg.
- Slow, steady exercise as the fat-burning zone: excess consumption of carbohydrate results in lipolycis (in the process of breaking down carbs, sugars are laid down as fat).
- Intervals: You can still calculate your average power output, but they damage muscle fibres more than steady-state training, and the damage lasts for up to 48 hours.
- If you run low on carbs, your body will enter a catabolic state and start breaking down muscle, because when you're in a negative calorie balance your body can't use all of its fat stores.
