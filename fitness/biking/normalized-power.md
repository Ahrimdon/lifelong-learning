[Reference](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/what-is-normalized-power/)

- Fundamentally, to build fitness, an athlete needs to apply a stress to the body, and through recovery from that stress, the body adapts and becomes stronger and is able to accommodate a greater stress in the next round of training.
- Fundamental components of stress: Intensity, duration, and frequency.
- From a feel perspective, constant 200 watts feels easier than 1 hour ride with intervals.
- Normalized power--calculated using a complex algorithm, but takes into account the variance between a steady workout and a fluctuating workout.
