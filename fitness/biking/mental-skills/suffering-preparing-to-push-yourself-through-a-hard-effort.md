[Reference](http://carriecheadle.com/resources/articles/suffering-on-the-bike/)

- Cyclists ride a course before a race go know exactly what to expect and have a good idea of the amount of effort that will be involved.
- Mentally prepare for the physical pain you will endure. You need to go int
- At high levels of physical intensity, you can control your focus so that it doesn't intensify the pain you feel.
- Keep on counting. Or create a smooth pedal stroke and relax your shoulders.
- Don't think about pain. Your perception of the pain you are experiencing has an impact on your ability to tolerate it. **Connect the feeling of pain yo accomplishing your goals. Associate the pain with something positive versus something negative. Fighting against the pain only makes it worse. Learn to accept the pain and appreciate it as part of the experience.**

#### Possible thoughts

- "Everyone is suffering."
- "The pain will be over soon. I can do anything for x minutes."
- "Suffering gets me closer to my goal." Very powerful, since you are changing your perception of the physical feeling of pain from something negative to something positive. **Connect the feeling of pain to getting stronger and accomplishing your goals.**
- Power word. You need a word that you say when you make that extra push. "Push." "Max out." "Go." Practice using your power cue work the next time you have intervals during a training ride.
- Control your thoughts so that they work for you instead of against you!

**You can say that climbers suffer the same as the other riders, but they suffer in a different way. You feel the pain, but youâ€™re glad to be there. -- Richard Virenque**

#### Relaxing Your Body

- Negative reaction to pain -> muscles become tense -> slows you down and can burn you out before the end of your race.
- Relax. Don't add extra physical tension as you compete. **To much muscular tension will interfere with the execution of a motor skill.**
- Use your brain to tell your body to relax.
- Drop your shoulders to release tension and chill out.
- Control your breathing. **Shallow breathing delivers less air per breath than full and complete breaths.** Taking full breaths can help slow your heart rate down and delivers adequate oxygen to your brain and muscles.
- **Mental skills don't make up for a lack of physical ability. You need to prepare for putting out big efforts both physically and mentally.** You need to prepare for putting out big efforts both physically and mentally.
