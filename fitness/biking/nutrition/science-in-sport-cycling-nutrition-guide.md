### Fueling Your Training

- Breakfast is one of the most important meals you consume and will set you up for the first bout on the bike, so make sure you are comfortable with it and it works for you.
- Your body can only store enough carbohydrate for up to 90-120 minutes, you need to intake up to 60-90g of carbohydrate per hour during prolonged exercise to maintain carbohydrate supply to your muscles.
- Sweat: Aim to not lose any more than 2-3% of your body mass to maintain hydration and be ready to train the next day.

- *Hydration.*
  - Post-training: Aim to replace 150% of the fluid volume lost through sweating.
  - Always make sure to weigh yourself before and after your training rides.
- *Energy.*
  - During short or low intense sessions, reduce carbohydrate intake.
  - For longer rides, aim to take on 60-90g of carb/hour.
  - Post-training: If you've had a tough session, 1.2 g/kg carb, starting within 30 minutes of finishing your ride.
- *Recovery.*
  - Overtraining is common in endurance athletes. Aim to get the same amount of sleep throughout your training period.
- *Caffeine.* Pre-training caffeine shot helps decrease your perception of fatigue and increase concentration during your rides.
