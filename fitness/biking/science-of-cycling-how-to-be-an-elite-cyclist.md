- Hour record: Better position or better cyclist?
- Hour record: It can be broken by having either a higher average wattage or a better technological innovation. This is around in the 430-450 watts average.
- This performance is about 2.5 times a normal person.
- Specific altitude? Depends on the cyclist.
- Age peak performance: 27, 28, 29. Doesn't matter for stage races or for single day races.
- Top 10 places in an entire career: 78% of all riders did not get a top 10 ever. 8% get one top 10 win in their whole career. Just 3% get 2 wins.
- Normalized for birth month, not just for cycling: The time of year you are born impacts your likelihood of being an elite athlete. Overall trend is there are more people winning races at the beginning of the year rather than the end of the year.
