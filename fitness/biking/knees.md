## Why Do My Knees Hurt?
[Reference](http://www.bicycling.com/training/health-injuries/why-do-my-knees-hurt)

- *Pain in the front*: Quads are too powerful that they deliver too much shear force across the joint. Check saddle height, saddle fore/aft, and/or crank length.
  - Big-gear mashing, climbing in big gears, and hard spinning can put undue stress.
- *Pain in the back*: Overextending the knee. Less common, but because saddle is too high or too far back.
- *Pain on the inside*: Improper cleat placement. Cleats positioned too close to the insides of your cycling shoes increase the distance between your feet.
- *Pain on the outside*: ITBS: Cleats placed too far on the outside of the shoes.

## Correct Knees-Out Pedaling

- Leg-length discrepancy. Widening your pedal stance,or using wedges, shims, and spacers to correct leg length discrepancies on your foot.
