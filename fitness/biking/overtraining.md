[Reference](http://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/five-ways-to-tell-whether-you-are-overtraining-147014)

- If everything feels like an effort, they're all signs you're overdoing it.
- "I have to be honest with myself and ask myself how I am feeling every day and adapt training to that."
- Physical signs: a consistently elevated resting heart rate, frequent colds, poor digestion, feeling dizzy when standing up, heart rate failing to rise to normal levels on the bike, a higher perceived level of exertion on the bike relative to power output, feeling 'flat' and lethargic, and constant hunger.
- Gravest symptom: "not getting a buzz from caffeine anymore!"
- Some indicators:
  - *Trouble sleeping.*  Cortisol is too high, a result of over-intensive training.
  - *Constant muscle soreness.* The muscles are constantly inflamed and unable to repair.
  - *Constant tiredness.* Prolonged muscular and mental fatigue caused by repeated breakdown of energy from training.
  - *Weight loss/lack of appetite.*
  - *Decreasing form.*
