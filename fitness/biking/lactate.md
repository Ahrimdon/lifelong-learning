## Six things you need to know about lactate threshold

Lactate threshold refers to the amount of power a rider can produce while keeping their lactate (lactic acid) levels under control. The more power we put out on the bike, the more lactate is produced and lactate only becomes a problem when we cannot process it fast enough.

Lactate is produced when your body burns glucose (this happens even if you aren't exercising). Once produced, lactate actually gets reprocessed back into glucose and used as a fuel. *When there is too much lactate for your muscles to process, it gets shipped off in  your blood stream for processing elsewhere in your body, and this raises your blood lactate.*

Lactate threshold occurs at the point where the amount of lactate in the blood reaches it's highest sustainable level. *This is how hard you can ride for a prolonged period without blowing up.*

Lactate is produced by fast twitch muscle fibers while is is processed by slow twitch muscle fibers.

For efforts of ten minutes or longer, lactate threshold is the physiological factor that will determine how much power a rider can put out. The higher a rider's lactate threshold, the more power they can sustain.

To measure your FTP, set at a pace you feel you can just sustain for 20 minutes.

The sweetspot intensity (between the upper level of zone three and zone four) is a very useful training tool for this. Training at sweetspot will give you the maximum gains on your lactate threshold. *However, if you train too much at sweetspot, your fast twitch fibers will start to be converted to slow twitch fibers. This means you can process more lactate, but with less powerful fast twitch fibers, the amount of power you can produce decrease.*

 To improve your lactate threshold effectively, you need to increase your type I muscle fibers can process, but you need to increase the amount of power your type II muscles can produce.

 Training plan--ride easy with lots of time in base zones, or very hard, up and above threshold, with not much riding in between. 80% easy, 20% hard.

 Base training makes type I more efficient to use oxygen and clear lactate, hard training makes type II produce lots of power, working at or above lactate threshold before recovering.

 Base session--three hours in zone 2, with cadence of 95rpm.

 Threshold session--warm up with 15 minutes in zone 2, 2x10 in upper zone four, 10 minutes zone 1, 2x5 minutes in zone 5, five minutes in zone 1 recovery between efforts.
