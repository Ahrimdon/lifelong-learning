*Put simply, VO2 Max is the maximal amount of oxygen you can breath in and use in a given period of time.*

The more oxygen you breath in, transport to your muscles and utilize, the more of a substance called ATP you can produce. ATP is the biological version of a rechargeable battery. The more ATP there is, the more energy available to your muscles and the harder you can push the pedals and the faster you can ride.

Important stats--the percentage of someone's VO2 max that they hit their lactate threshold, and economy--how many watts a rider can produce per liter of oxygen they breath in and use.

There is probably a pre-determined upper limit for each individual. What can be achieved with training is how close an athlete is to that upper limit.

You can increase the speed you can transport blood around your body. The faster blood is being pumped, the more oxygen is being transported to the muscles. To do this, the amount of blood pumped with each beat of your heart needs to be improved. *This means train in zone five, short hard intervals designed to have you using as much oxygen as possible over a short period. This encourages your body to adapt and improve the rate at which is can deliver oxygen to your muscles.*

Second way--increasing the amount of oxygen that your muscles can use. The more mitochondria you have, the more oxygen you can burn. *This means train in upper zone three/sweetspot. You can't do a combination of zone three and five because you'll get tired. What I recommend is polarized training. Combining 20% zone five with 80% zone two will mean you are working on both your stroke volume and your ablity to burn oxygen.*

Sample training session (three hours)

- One hour zone two
- 3 x 6 minutes zone five with 6 minutes active recovery between efforts
- 30 minutes zone two
- 3 x 6 minutes zone five with 6 minutes active recovery between efforts
- Complete the rest of the ride at zone two
