## Relationship Between Drafting and Climbing
[Reference](http://www.voler.com/connect/detail/li/RelationshipBetweenDraftingandClimbing)

- Being successful at climbing has much to do about mentally preparing for a climb, staying focused, and being relaxed.
- Although physical drafting is negligible, "mental drafting" is huge. Never panic. Remember the best climbers want to disrupt the rhythm of the climb. Knowing this, you can shake other riders on a climb faster than on the flats by changing the pace for a bit.
- Climbs are rarely on a steady gradient, so you want to be on somebody's wheel for the flatter bits, where there really is a significant advantage.
