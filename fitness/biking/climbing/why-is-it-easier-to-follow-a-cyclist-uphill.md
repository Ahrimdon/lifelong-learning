## Why Is It Easier to Follow a Cyclist Uphill
[Reference](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10326/why-is-it-easier-to-follow-a-cyclist-up-hill)

- Position/pacing: Riders who lead out the climb will be climbing near their aerobic threshold, and if you want to catch up, you will have to work hard, likely putting in an anaerobic effort.
- This is not good because you will burn up a match in the process.
- If you let a gap form, then you have to follow the peloton downhill, putting in possibly twice the effort.
- If someone is climbing hard, you just stare at that wheel and you do not let that gap widen. Keep repeating this to yourself and before you know it the climb is over.
- Riding really close lets you judge when you are slacking off. It is much easier to work to pick up an inch than to chase 5-10 feet. *When everyone is at a similar fitness level you need to fight for every bloody inch you can get. Focusing on something like the wheel in front helps you not focus on the pain you are currently enduring.*
- As long as you are riding in the atmosphere and not in a vacuum, there is some benefit to drafting.
- At the speeds you see in the World Tour, a pro rider can still receive a "savings" in power of between 5-10 watts by following someone else.
