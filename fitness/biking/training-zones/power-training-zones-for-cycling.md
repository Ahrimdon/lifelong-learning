## Power Training Zones for Cycling
[Reference](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/power-training-levels/)

- Power at lactate threshold (LT) is the most important physiological determinant of endurance cycling performance, since it integrates VO2 max, the % of VO2 max that can be sustained for a given duration, and cycling efficiency.
- In theory, an athlete's power at LT needs a lab to test.
- HR guidelines:
- Perceived exertion: This increases over time even at a constant intensity/power.
- Average power during mass start races typically falls at zone 3. Races are often more stressful than training at zone 3, due to the greater variability in power. So there is an inverse relationship between power output and the duration that power can be sustained.

### Level 1

- Active recovery.
- < 55% power, < 68% HR. "Easy spinning", very low level exercise, too low in and of itself to induce significant physiological adaptations.
Minimal sensation of leg effort of leg effort/fatigue. Requires no concentration to maintain pace, and continuous conversation is possible. Used for active recovery, socializing.

### Level 2

- Endurance.
- 56-75% power, 69-83% HR. "All day" pace, or classic long slow distance (LSD) training. Low effort/fatigue, but may rise periodically to higher levels when climbing.
- Concentration generally required to maintain effort only at highest end of range. Conversation is still possible.

### Level 3

- Tempo.
- 76-90% power, 84-94% HR. Fartlek intensity, group ride, moving paceline. Requires concentration to maintain alone, especially at upper end of range, to prevent effort from falling back to level 2.
- Conversation is halting, possible to do 2x in a row, but need carbohydrate/low duration.

### Level 4

- Lactate threshold.
- 91-105% power, 95-105% HR. Continuous sensation of moderate or even greater leg effort/fatigue. Hard to have a conversation. Sustained exercise at this level is mentally very taxing, so performed usually in multiple repeats, modules, or blocks of 10-30 minutes duration.

#### Level 5

- VO2 max.
- 106-120% power, > 106% HR. Typical intensity of longer intervals intended to increase VO2 max. Completion of more than 30-40 min total training time is difficult at best.
- Can't talk.

#### Level 6

- Anaerobic capacity.
- > 121%. Short, high intensity intervals designed to increase anaerobic capacity. HR generally not useful as guide to intensity due to non-steady-state nature of effort.

#### Level 7

- Neuromuscular power.
- Very short, very high intensity efforts that place greater stress on musculoskeletal, rather than metabolic systems.
