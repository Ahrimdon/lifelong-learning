## What to Eat Before Running
[Reference](https://www.verywell.com/should-i-eat-before-a-run-2911547)

- Eating immediately before a run can lead to cramping or side stitches.
- Running on an empty stomach may cause you to run out of energy.
- *Snack or light meal about 1 1/2 to 2 hours before you start running.*
- High in carb, low in fat, fiber, and protein. Bagel with peanut butter, turkey/cheese on whole wheat bread, oatmeal with berries, banana and energy bar.
- Morning run: Try eating a small snack so you're not starting your run with an empty tank, but still 30 minutes before you start, and drink water.
- Nothing new on race day.
