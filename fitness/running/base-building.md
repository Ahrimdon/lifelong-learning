## A Runner's Guide to Base Building

Elite athletes succeed in winning races and breaking world records using cyclic training.

3 core phases--base building, peak, recovery. *Base building means starting from a lower base of infrequent mileage and progressing to more frequent runs including two to three shorter runs and one long run per week. Base building for the newbie is defined by building regularity in training at consistent, easy-to-moderate effort levels, while high intensity, speed work is left to future training cycles when experience and mileage are well established.* In one sense, the first training session for a newbie is an extended version of the base building cycle from which they will progress to run another event and try to improve their performance. *Mileage should increase by no more than 10 percent each week and intensity should be kept at an easy to moderate level.*

Another important ingredient for newbie base building is cross-training as it serves as active rest for the running muscles. *By alternating running days with cross-training days, the newbie body can train at a higher overall frequency without the high risk of injury from running on back-to-back days.* Cycling, swimming, and classes at the gym are a few favorite cross-training activities for runners and should be done at an easy effort level if your primary goal is a running event. Total body strength training twice per week can also contribute to the success of your running by building strong muscles, tendons and joints.

As you progress, include short and long easy runs, hills runs, and short interval speed workouts. *The speed workout in the initial stages of base building can force on short, very hard intensity intervals of 30-75 seconds with longer active recoveries jogging easy for three to four minutes.* From there it flows into longer three to five minute intervals at around 5K pace. As you progress closer to the race, training becomes more specific to the demands and effort levels on race day. By the time you're into the peak phase, the long run mileage continues to progress while the speed effort level more closely simulates that of race pace or slightly faster for longer intervals.

## Building Base Mileage

There are two basic ideas that I like to keep in mind when I look at my own mileage increases. The first is the old hard/easy pattern. Put very simply, the hard/easy idea is that you alternate harder days with easier days. This allows you to recover fully from your training. *Remember that we don't improve during the hard workouts, we improve as we recover from the hard workouts. If we don't get enough recovery, we don't get the benefit of the workout.*

*To put actual mileage to the pattern above, a 16 miles per week schedule on 4 days/week would look like this: 0,4,2,0,4,0,6.*

The second component beyond the pattern for the weekly schedule is how, and how fast, to add mileage. Here I like the advice of running coach Jack Daniels. His suggestion is that you add no more than 1 mile for every day/week that you run. So if you run 4 days per week, add no more than 4 miles to your weekly mileage. This may seem like a lot for newer runners, but actually works well.

*One common mistake that we make is to add days to our schedule at the same time that we add distance to our week. When you add another day to your running week, you are significantly reducing your recovery time. If you run 4 days/week and then go to 5 days/week, you have cut your rest days by a third.* Because of this, it is important to not add any mileage to the week when you add a running day. When you add the day, reduce the distance of your runs on the other days so that the total mileage is the same, but spread out over more days. Keep this schedule for 3 weeks before you add back any mileage.

## Miles in the Bank

Best to consider a 10 percent increase every two weeks as a firm upper limit, with 5 percent every two weeks being closer to the safe ideal. Conservative and consistent training is all important, and the slower you build your mileage base the better.

*While in the base-building phase, smart runners learn to stretch consistently while very gradually adding strength work and mileage, but not necessarily intensity.* As you reach 30 to 35 miles per week, level off until you become very comfortable with this amount. Make this your solid base before adding more miles. Except for those few runners lucky enough to be born very biomechanically efficient, most begin to see a breakdown around this point unless they pause to establish a strong foundation. Base training is fundamental to staying healthy and building confidence.

As long as you are not picking up your speedwork very suddenly at the same time, you should be able to add a mile or two to your long run every two weeks. This may seem like a painfully slow rate of increase, but it's a lot less painful than the injury you might otherwise risk. Take it slow, it's better than being sidelined for several weeks.

*In fact, the most important and often underrated component of a good running program is rest.* The body adapts and gets stronger only if you give it a chance to recover after vigorous workouts. All too often, the runner's ego might stop you from listening to common sense, but don't feel that you have to train harder than you really need. As you build mileage, keep in mind that rest and recovery are essential.

*This means not only that you should take a rest day after your long run (and you certainly should), but also that you should think in terms of an entire week of rest after high-mileage efforts.* Every two or three weeks, indulge your legs with a rest week by cutting down your weekly mileage by 10 or even 20 percent. The next week, you can resume your normal mileage again.

## The Basics Of Base Training For Runners

- The goal of base training is to develop a runner's aerobic potential before implementing anaerobic training in the form of interval work. This is why you have to develop the aerobic system to its maximum.

- False fitness: a surface fitness level that can crumble due to missed training, illness, injury, and life issues.
- 4 week window of nothing but running and building your overall mileage to your lifetime maximum. No workouts except for one day a week of a few strides. Weekly long run should gradually increase during this period and be more of a moderate effort vs an easy day effort.
- You should increase your weekly mileage by roughly 10 each week including increasing the long run by 15% each week.
