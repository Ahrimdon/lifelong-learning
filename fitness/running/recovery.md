## Post-Run Recovery Tips
[Reference](http://www.runnersworld.com/injury-treatment/post-run-recovery-tips)

- We strain ourselves to go longer or faster than is comfortable. In so doing, we deplete our fuel sources and cause tears in our muscle tissue.
- Stimulated by the damage, our bodies adapt to this. Our stores open for maximum refueling, and our veins deliver white blood cells to repair the micro tears.
- So it's in the time between workouts that we become better athletes.
- Avoiding body shock: Move smoothly from a walk to the intended running pace, and back.
- Hilly run to recover from the tedium of a flat run, and a flat run to recover from the stress of a hilly run.
- For two hours post-workout, your body is trying to restock what it just burnt. So keep a recovery drink in hand, either in your car or gym bag.
- Emotional stress delivers a physical manifestation, if your muscles are clenched, they're not recovering, so take some time to relax.
- Recovery drink: 4-1 ratio of carbohydrate to protein.
- Don't do ibuprofen. Elevate your legs above your heart whenever you get a chance, take an ice bath and consume more anti-inflammatory foods.

- "You are only as good as you recover."
- You need long runs, workouts, and weekly mileage, but if you can;t recover from those hard efforts, they aren't doing you much good.
- Day-to-Day Recovery: Compression apparel. Little lab data exists, but anecdotal evidence is a lot. Recovery footwear. Recovery nutrition: sports nutritionists recommend ingesting 200-300 calories. Or energy bar, sports drink.
-Recovery weeks: Training schedules are in four week blocks. These all conclude with a recovery week. 20-30 percent reduction in volume from the highest weekly total.
- Recovery block: 2-4 week periods of detraining. 2 per year, followed by 5 month cycle of training and racing. Each recovery period begins with no running whatsoever followed by two weeks of unfocused easy running.
