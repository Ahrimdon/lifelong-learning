- Warm-up: dilates your blood vessels, raises your muscles' temperature, minimized stress on your heart when you start your run.
- Cooldown keeps the blood flowing throughout the body.
- Stopping suddenly can cause light-headedness because your heart rate and blood pressure drop rapidly.
- It's not a good idea to stretch cold muscles, so don't start with stretching.
- 5-10 minutes light aerobic exercise to loosen up your muscles. Don't rush your warm up.
- Cool down: 5-10 minutes. Now you can stretch.
