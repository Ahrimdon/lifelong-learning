## Detraining: The truth about losing fitness
[Reference](http://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/detraining-the-truth-about-losing-fitness-22330)

- Day 3: If you had been training hard, your cycling fitness is now probably enhanced (glycogen recovers, muscle fibers have been fully repaired, and favorable metabolic changes in the muscles have had time to occur.) This is why tapering works.
- Day 7: After 3 days, your blood volume can be reduced by 5-12 percent. This means a decrease in the amount of blood your heart can pump, both in terms of amount of blood pumped per beat and total blood volume per minute.
  - After six days or so, muscles begin to become less efficient at "soaking up" glucose from the bloodstream. You need to place more reliance on your limited muscle glycogen stores, and you become less efficient at building up those glycogen stores after exercise.
  - Muscles start to become less efficient at coping with lactate accumulation during sustained efforts of hard cycling.
- Weeks 2-3:
  - Your maximal oxygen uptake will have declined by anything from 4-20%. Part from reduced cardiac output, and the muscle mass in the pumping chambers of the heart can decrease by almost 20% after 3 weeks of inactivity.
- One month:
  - Your muscle capillarization will have returned to your pre-training baseline. However, still likely to be higher than in people who have never trained.
  - Not only i your overall muscle mass declining, but muscle fibers known as Type IIa (used during high-intensity sustained efforts) start reverting to Type IIx fibers, with greatly reduced endurance capacity.
- 2-3 months:
  - The thickness of the muscle walls that comprise the pumping chambers is reduced by as much as 25%. Mitochondria is also becoming less efficient at using oxygen to produce energy in your muscles.
  - The efficiency can decline by 25-45 percent up to 12 weeks after training cessation.
  - After 3 months, hormonal detraining: more stress hormones are released during exercise, which means that the same exercise intensity becomes more stressful for the body, which in turn increases recovery times.
- 6 months
  - The actual volume of mitochondria per unit volume of muscle is declining, further reducing your ability to use oxygen during exercise.
  - You'll almost certainly have gained body fat due to a lower daily calorie burn and a loss of muscle mass.

### The science

- Cardiovascular: stop training and your blood volume falls, which means there is a decrease in the total amount of blood your heart can pump during exercise. Smaller dimensions of the heart muscle, all of these reduce the amount of oxygen you can transport to your working muscles.
- Metabolic: your muscles will find it harder to produce energy from your fat stores. Lower endurance since carb stores are limited.

*Research shows that reducing your training volume by 2/3 won't harm your fitness, provided you include some very intense work, such as intervals, in the remaining one third.*
