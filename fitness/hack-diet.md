## Hack Diet

- If people didn't eat except when their bodies needed food, nobody would be overweight.
- Our bodies don't have a built-in eat watch.
- You don't exercise to lose weight, although it certainly helps. *You exercise because you'll live longer and you'll feel better.*
- Average calories I burn per day: Let's say 1900.
- If over a period of time, the calories in the food you eat exceed the calories you burn by 3500, you'll put on about a pound. If you reduce your food intake so that you burn 3500 calories more than you eat, you'll lose about a pound.
- Regular exercise increases the metabolism a little, but for the most part you have to play the metabolic hand you're dealt.
- Don't delude yourself into thinking that exercise can do the whole job. For many of us, exercising just causes us to eat that little bit more that cancels out its benefits.
- *Permanent weight control requires permanent attention to what you eat. Lifelong, permanent attention.*
- Slim people don't go hungry all the time, they are putting in just the right amount of food their bodies are burning. Even most overweight people maintain a constant weight without hunger.
- *People who never get overweight have a mechanism in their bodies that tells them whent to eat and when to stop.*
- You only have to put up with it for a limited amount of time.
- *Many things in life are unpleasant. Most are far more irritating than the day to day process of losing weight, and few yield comparable benefits.*
- *What better motivation is there to maintain your weight that recalling how awful you felt when overweight and what you went through to shed that excess poundage?"*
- Food only satisfied 2 needs of the body:
  - Energy: To maintain a constant body temp.
  - Supplies raw materials the body uses to manufacture all the chemicals it needs.
- Eating the right mix of food only becomes important when you consider food as raw material.
- The energy-producing aspect of food is what determines whether you gain or lose weight.
- Since we have no real control over what goes out, what we do have control over is what we put in. The number of calories you burn is roughly the same per day.

### Food and Feedback

- "Bang-bang" control: Keep the temperature within the limit.
- Proportional control: The action taken is in proportion to the degree the system diverges from the ideal point.
- Someone who is never overweight: he has a proportional negative feedback linkage between his body's need for calories and his appetite for food. Control is accomplished through a signal called appetite.
- His feedback system connects calories eaten to appetite.
- *You won't be any more hungry at your optimal weight than at any weight above it. The rubber bag cares only about the difference between what goes in and what goes out.*
- Sam has a built-in eat watch, a proportional negative feedback system that adjusts what he eats, by controlling appetite, to equal what his body burns.
- Other people might have a watch that when they eat at their normal amount, they gain weight.

### Signal and Noise

- Moving average of last 10 days?
- Smoothing constant, weighted moving average.
- Rapid weight loss for him: 1.2 pounds per week, daily deficit 620 calories.

### Exercise

- Exercise: Think of it in a way that by exercising, you extend your lifespan by so and so years. If you're 40 years old, and you exercise 15 minutes a day from now until you turn 65, you'll spend about a quarter of a year exercising.
- But if by exercising you manage to live 3 years longer, then you're ahead by a total of two and three quarters years.
- You will also feel better.

#### Goals:

- Minimum time per day.
- Time spent doesn't increase as you progress.
- Easy to start.
- No pain.
- Progress at your own pace.
- No equipment needed.
- Daily summary: Weigh yourself, record weight in log, calculate trend number, exercise.

### Planning meals:

- You wouldn't consider for a moment investing in a company that had no budgets, where everybody said, "we just spend whatever we feel like from day to day, and hope it will all work out in the long run."
- By trying to "wing it", you're placing something even more precious than money in the hands of a process you know inevitably leads to serious trouble.
- Just fix whatever meal schedule you have to work with less calories.
- One exception: If you eat a large meal and then immediately go to sleep, all those calories will be there when your metabolism is at its lowest level.
- *You'll end up packing on weight yet wake up ravenously hungry the next day (since the calories were turned into fat).*
- Eat pretty much the same from day to day. It's just easier to balance. Without this meal planning, the little 100 calories here or there will show up.
- If you have a bad eat watch, then not use your body's feedback mechanism.
- Eating out: as long as you eat about the same amount of the same kinds of things you've worked out for home meals, you probably won't have any problems.
- At some point, when you get familiar with meal planning, you'll find out it is actually liberating.
- Frozen dinners can help since they guarantee that you'll get exactly the food you need.

### Losing Weight

- Estimate calories.
- Plan meals.
- Compute trend.
- Adjust calories. Just like a feedback system, this keeps on going.
- Remember: 500 calories a day deficit means 52 pounds per year.
- Think of if this way: You've endured awful realities knowing that it's only for a while and we never have to do it again.
- The only thing that's going to cause your fat cells to start tapping their reserves is lowering blood sugar below a given level. As they detect low blood sugar, they cease banking excess calories and begin breaking down fat and releasing energy into the bloodstream.
- The fat cells begin to make up the shortage of food, and your weight begins to fall.
- Stress and preoccupation with difficult tasks does help you diet.
- Many people find they don't feel much worse on 500 calories a day for one or two days than on 1200.
- Having your stomach filled with anything, even water that's passing through, helps counter the immediate desire to eat.
- Burning fat means individual fat molecules breaking down into the simple molecules you burn. Chemical plants produce waste products, and for fats, those are ketones.
- As long as you're burning fat, your body will be subjected to a constant does of extra ketones in the blood, a condition known as ketosis.
- When you burn fat, you change the body's center of gravity, adopt a different posture to compensate, reduce the mount of insulation (so higher metabolism to maintain your body temperature).
- The ketones that result from burning fat may show up in your breath as well as your blood. :(
- As you exercise, you build muscles and increase the performance of the cardiovascular system that delivers matter and energy throughout your body.
- When you reduce the volume of food, you might disrupt the normal pace that solids move through the body. *Ideally, what you'd like to do is maintain the same volume of food you were eating before the diet while reducing its calorie content to the level in your diet plan.*
- High fiber, few calories. You get a large amount of bulk per calorie, and not only does it make the digestive system move along, but it also makes for large, satisfying meals. This is by far the best way to increase the bulk in your diet.
- A hungry stomach will not allow its owner to forget it, whatever his cares and sorrows. Ultimately, success in anything requires motivation from within, that the person undertaking the task believes in its worth and values accomplishing it above whatever effort is required to that end.

### Why am I doing this to myself

- *Live longer:* All old geezers are thin. Whatever you value in life, you can't enjoy it if you're dead. What's the trade-off between a few bad days in the course of a diet against living for five or ten more years? *Dieting is unpleasant and bad days are wretched, but dropping dead is worse. Tomorrow will be better.*
- *Better health:* Heart attacks, habitual shortness of breath, muscle aches/pains. *If a bad day comes a month or two into the diet, think back to the beginning. Think beyond the hunger to how you feel physically and what you've accomplished so far. And remember that your present situation pales before how much you'll enjoy finally achieving the goal.*
- *Accomplish more.* There is a not-so-subtle discrimination against overweight people in more organizations. "Do I really want to bet on somebody who can't even manage his weight?" Another barrier: they aren't "dynamic" and don't have the energy and stamina to see through difficult tasks. This is unjustified, but still happens every day.
- *Can I learn from being hungry?* Do you want to eat, or to stop the hunger? Most of the times we eat, we're not actually hungry. We eat because it's our regular meal time or because we associate eating with a given activity. Hunger is something very different. Hunger is a command, not a request. Hunger is looking at your dog curled up sleeping on the rug and thinking, "I wonder how much meat there is beneath all that fur?" One thing you learn from the worst moments in a diet is what hunger really is. *You realize that most of the times people say "I'm really hungry", they're really nothing of the sort.* In all likelihood, they're motivated to eat by something entirely distinct from hunger. Getting to know hunger first hand teaches you how unrelated the motivation to eat is from your need for calories and how important it is, to control what you eat by some means other than instinct.
- How will I feel right after I eat? Yes, the hunger will be gone, but will what replaces it (fat?) be an improvement? *you've bi*
- What food is worth it? Think about their calories compared to the calorie deficit in your meal plan, and then work out, in your mind, how much longer your diet will run if you add such a food every day.

### Secret weapons

- Liquids.
- Caffeine.
- Bouillon. 2 cubes make 8 fluid ounces, but contain only 8 calories, almost negligible.
- Sauerkraut. 1 cup = 45 calories.
- Dill pickles. Each medium size pickle has about 7 calories.
- Popcorn. One cup of air-popped popcorn is only 25 calories. No butter!
- The morning after. No midnight snack.

- Too many bad days. Really difficult times happen no more frequently than every other month, and never lasted beyond the next meal. If you find you're suffering real hunger (as opposed to the desire to eat), it's time to revise your meal or diet plan.
- At the end of your diet, don't just take the calorie deficit from your last month's trend chart and immediately add that number to your meal plan.
- The optimum weight for me is about 150-160 lbs.

## Perfect Weight Forever

- People with a tendency to gain weight need continual guidance about how much to eat.
- You don't lend a pair of glasses to a nearsighted person, remove them, and say "OK, you're on you're own." If your eyes don't focus, you need optical correction to live a normal life, and you need it all life long.

### Causes for Confidence

- You're armed with data, charts, and direct personal experience that tell you precisely how your body works. You have a plan of your own, seen for yourself how it worked, and used it to achieve a long term goal many people never even attempt.
- You've survived an unpleasant experience (shedding weight), and there's no motivation quite so strong as the desire to NEVER endure that again.
- You've learned, by riding out the most difficult days of your diet, the distinction between real hunger and simply wanting to eat.
- You've stabilized your weight near the goal you set for yourself. Permanent weight control is now a matter of preserving this stability.
- You're beginning to think of yourself as thin and healthy; these are becoming part of your sense of self. Before long, you won't consider forfeiting them any more than you'd contemplate cutting off a finger.
- You need continual guidance to achieve an accurate calorie balance week after week, month after month, year after year. This is why we have trend calculations and charts that tracked the calorie deficits which can guarantee stable weight forever. All you need to do is to adjust your meals not for a calorie deficit, but to balance the calories you eat with the calories you burn.
- By insuring you get just the calories you need, you're guaranteed to never be hungry as long as you adjust the size of your meals and their schedule based on your need for calories throughout the day.
- Resuming a meal plan already proven effective for losing weight provides assurance the trend cannot slip out of control.
- If more than 5 pounds above the goal, start dieting again.
- If less than 5 pounds, then just do something very small per day (possibly just < 200 calories.
- *The only way you gain back the weight you lost is by deliberately choosing to; by discarding the simple and easy feedback that keeps your weight under control, by taking off the eat watch.*
- The slow creep into snowballing weight gain that is the undoing of most dieters cannot happen any other way.
- If you aren't already committed to maintaining your weight, wait until you've gotten really used to being thin and fit, then no temptation will induce you to resume the life of a fat person.
- Don't rely on your appetite; it's still broken, and it shouldn't be trusted in any case. You're using your eyes to measure what your stomach can't how much to eat at a sitting.
- *In a year or so, controlling your weight like this will seem as easy as riding a bicycle, and something you're no more likely to ever forget. Like riding a bicycle, it was far from easy to learn, but hard-won skills tend to be the most enduring. Unlike a bicycle, you need never to remove the training wheels.*
- If you succeed, you do so that you do not suffer from a character flaw or weakness of will, but a broken feedback system: not a deep-seated psychological problem but a built-in eat watch that ran too fast.
