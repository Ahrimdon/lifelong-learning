## How To Carb Load
[Reference](https://cyclingtips.com/2009/05/how-to-carb-load/)

- Average male athlete can store about 1500 to 1900 calories of carbs in the blood, liver, and muscles combined.
- 2 hours of exercise can deplete glycogen levels.
- Rest during these two days allows your muscles to build up plenty of glycogen stores when you consume the proper amount of carbs.
- 10 grams of carbs per kg of body weight daily in the two days leading up to race day.
- *Don't go and eat a massive bowl of pasta the night before a race and expect a miracle to happen.*
- 85kg: 2 days before the even I would start eating 850 grams of pasta or rice per day along with some protein (3400 calories of pasta per day).
- On the day of the race, the athlete performs a very short, extremely high-intensity workout, then consumes 12g of carbohydrate per kilo of lean mass over the next 24 hours. 90% increase in glycogen storage.
- Race Tune-Up: 1.5 hours total with 3 x 1 minutes hard, with at least 5 minutes of easy between each. Also 3 x 30 second hard sprints, with 5 minutes between.

## Nutrition: What is Carb Loading?

- The purpose of carb loading is to maximize the stores of your muscles' primary energy store, glycogen. Your body can also draw energy from your fat reserves, but glycogen is the most easily accessible source, particularly when you're riding hard.
- *60g carbohydrate per hour.*
- By increasing stores of oxygen, it's estimated that endurance performance can be boosted by 2-3%.
- Our muscles will naturally hold enough energy to fuel us for about 90 minutes of exercise, after which you risk running out of energy (hitting the wall or bonking).
- Fat content should be kept low (to keep gut residue low), low fiber (to minimize the chance of pooping).
- *The idea behind carb loading is to increase the proportion of carbohydrate in your diet.*

Example Diet:

- Breakfast: 3 cups low-fiber breakfast cereal with milk, one medium banana, and 250ml of orange juice.
- Snack: One toasted muffin with honey and 500ml sports drink.
- Lunch: Two sandwiches (four slices of bread) with filling and 200g low-fat fruit yogurt.
- Snack: Banana smoothie with low-fat milk, banana, and honey cereal bar.
- Dinner: One cup pasta sauce with 2 cups cooked pasta, 2 slices garlic bread, 2 glasses of cordial.
- Late snack: Toasted bagel with jam, 500ml sports drink.

For every gram of glycogen stored, the body will also store 2g of water. You will be slightly heavier.

## Does Carb-Loading Really Work?

- A study found that carb loading before lifting gave them more time before they felt exhausted.
- During training, a low carb, high fat diet can help train the body to use fat for energy and reduce its dependence on carbohydrates. Even for athletes who don't use a low carb diet in training, the carb-loading process should kick off with the depletion of glycogen stores via a low-carb diet for 2 days plus some intense exercise to wipe out the glycogen already in the tank.
- About 3 days before the event, begin a loading period of increased carb intake.
- *Carbs should comprise between 63 and 81 percent of total calories.* Mid-workout fuel: no difference from loading up on natural carb sources compared to the manufactured stuff. Sports drinks.
- How much to eat: *4 grams of carabohydrates per day for each pound of weight.* (For a 150-pound person, that means two cups of cereal, one banana, four pieces of bread, and four cups of pasta, or any combination of foods that comes out to 600 grams of carbs.)
- Keep calories consistent with normal eating habits in order to avoid weight gain.
- Balance blood sugar: A spike in blood sugar can result from eating high-glycemic, sugary carbs. To avoid the spike and slump, combine carbs with fat and protein and eat carbs that vary on the GI scale.
- Pre-race breakfast: Wheat toast with peanut butter and a sliced banana.

# The Right Way to Carb-Load Before a Race

- Rice, oatmeal, bread, pancakes, waffles, bagels, yogurt, juice.
- 2-3 days before the event, 85 to 95 percent of your calories should come from carbs. About 3000 calories of carbs per day.
- The night before: don't stuff yourself. Dinner should be small, but carb-heavy. Eat on the early side so you have lots of time to digest.
- The race morning: have breakfast. Three hours before the start, eat 150g of carbs. You might have to wake up to eat carbs.

# Do cyclists really need to carb-load before a big ride?
[Reference](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/do-cyclists-really-need-to-carb-load-before-a-big-ride-284707)

- Carb-load only when it matters: for key races longer than 75 minutes.
- Races of 90 minutes plus require on-bike refueling.
- Load over 36-48 hours with the correct amount: 8-10 g of carbs per kg of bodyweight per day.
- No point in eating beyond the 10g/kg/day maximum advised intake in the 48 hours prior to the event. Overeating will only cause bloating and may negatively affect performance.
- Depleting before: no need.
- 70kg cyclist = 600-700g carbs each day.
- Periodizing your carb intake: do some rides in a carb-depleted state.
- Only carb load for long-duration races, those in which you want a fast time.
