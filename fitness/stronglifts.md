Stronglifts 5×5 uses five free weight compound exercises: the Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Overhead Press and Barbell Row. You do three of these exercises each workout, three times a week, for about 45 minutes per workout. You Squat every workout, three times a week.

Unlike most bodybuilding routines, your goal on StrongLifts 5×5 isn't to reach failure, get “pumped” or be sore. *Your goal is to add weight.* Here's how: start light, focus on proper form and add 2.5kg/5lb each workout for as long as you can. This is the simplest way to get stronger – fast.

- Use free weights, not machines.
- Do compound exercises, not isolation.
- Add weight, not train for pump and soreness.

## Summary of Stronglifts 5×5

- Workout A: Squat, Bench Press, Barbell Row.
- Workout B: Squat, Overhead Press, Deadlift.

Your goal is to increase the weight each workout. If you get five reps on each set, add 2.5kg/5lb next time you do that exercise (so 1.25kg/2.5lb on each side of the bar). If you get 1×5 on Deadlifts, add 5kg/10lb next time.

## Goals: Getting Stronger

- Free weights. Machines balance the weight for you which leaves your stabilizing muscles weak. Free weights force you to balance the weight yourself which strengthens your stabilizers.
- Compound exercises. You rarely do single-joint movements like curls in the real world. Carrying or picking up heavy objects always engages several muscles.
- Barbells. Easier to squat with 180kg on your back than with 90kb per hand. It's also easier to add 2.5kg/5lb each workout when using barbells than dumbbells.
- 5 reps. You can use more weight if you do five reps than 8, 10, or 12. The more reps you do, the more tired you get and the worse your form becomes.
- Frequency. The more you do an exercise, the better your form gets and the more efficient you become at lifting.

*Mindset: Strength training is a marathon, not a sprint. Don't be the "hare" who starts heavy to get quick PRs. Be the tortoise: start light, add a little bit of weight each workout, and get stronger at a steady pace.*

## Goals: Building Muscle

Unlike many guys believe, you don't need to train a muscle directly for it to grow. You don't need to do a dozen of exercises each workout to hit your muscles from every angle. And the best way to gain muscle is NOT to train until failure to get “pumped” and wake up sore.

The key to building muscle isn't the amount of exercises, it's the intensity. Squatting 100kg for 5x5 is a workout by itself. *You're happy you don't have to do more than three exercises per workout.*
