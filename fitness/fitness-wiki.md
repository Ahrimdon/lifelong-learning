- Healthy/sustainable weight loss: 1 pound per week, or 52 pounds per year.
- Muscle building: 20-25 pounds of muscle per year.
- Most important factors:
  - An appropriate amount of exercise at an appropriate intensity
  - A form of progression over time
  - Eating an appropriate amount of calories and protein
  - Getting enough sleep, rest, and recovery time
  - Consistency over time in all of the above

## Improving Your Diet

- **This is a change to your lifestyle. You are basically this new person now. This is why people yo-yo for years.**
- It's all about calories, protein, and generally eating well. Estimate your TDEE in calories, eat 10-20% fewer to lose weight, 10-20% more to gain weight.
- 120g of protein as a minimum, up to 160g for muscle gain per day.
- 0.38g/lb of fat per day.
- Eat like an adult.
- Calories in, calories out: if you are doing strength training, some of your gains will be muscle.
