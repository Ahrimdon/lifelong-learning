# The 4 Hour Body

- All diets: eat more greens, eat less saturated fat, exercise more and burn more calories, and eat more omega-3 fatty acids.
- Over fat? Try timed protein and pre-meal lemon juice.
- Undermuscled? Ginger and sauerkraut.
- Can't sleep? Try upping your saturated fat or using cold exposure.

## Fundamentals

- Minimum effective dose: the smallest dose that will produce a desired outcome. Like boiling water.
- To remove stored fat--do the least necessary to trigger a fat-loss cascade of specific hormones.
- To add muscle--do the least necessary to trigger local and systemic growth mechanisms.

### New Rules for Rapid Redesign

- Exercise means performing an MED of precise movements that will produce a target change. Recreation is for fun.
- Eating more, then less, then more, and so on in a continuous sine wave is an impulse we can leverage to reach goals faster.
- Maintaining peak condition year-round is a ticket to the mental ward.
- Don't accept predisposition. You can feed and train you toward a different physical future. "Bad genetics" can't be your go-to excuse.
- You have to measure things to change them.

*Rule 1: It's not what you put in your mouth that matters, it's what makes it to your bloodstream. If it passes through, it doesn't count.*

*Rule 2: The hormonal responses to carbs, protein, and fat are different.*

- 1000 cals at 90% fat: Loss of 09.9lbs per day.
- 1000 cals at 90% protein: Loss of 0.6lbs per day.
- 1000 cals at 90% carbs: Gain of 0.24lbs per day.

## Ground Zero

- Most people have an insufficient reason for action. The pain isn't painful enough. It's a "nice-to-have", not a "must-have". There has been no "Harajuku moment."
- There are no reminders. No consistent tracking = no awareness - no behavioral change. Consistent tracking, even if you have no knowledge of fat-loss or exercise, will often beat advice from world-class trainers.
- Chad Fowler's Harajuku moment: "It doesn't matter what I wear, I'm not going to look good anyway. I am, in most of my endeavors, a solidly successful person. I decide I want things to be a certain way, and I make it happen. I've done it with my career, my learning of music, understanding of foreign languages, and basically everything I've tried to do."
- "I've known that the key to getting started down the path of being remarkable in anything is to simply act with the intention of being remarkable."
- "If I want a better-than-average career, I can't simply 'go with the flow' and get it. *Most people do that: they wish for an outcome but make no intention-driven actions toward that outcome.* If they would just do something most people would find that they get some version of the outcome they're looking for. That's my secret. Stop wishing and start doing.
- Oversimplifying is one of the next things I'll mention as a tool.
- If you are just kinda right, and the numbers are directionally right, you can make a big difference with them.
- "I set up a workstation where I could pedal on a recumbent bike white working." I used an HRM while pedalling to make sure that when I was having fun playing a game I was doing myself some good.
- Because of the constant use of an HRM, I was able to combine fun and exercise or annoying chores and exercise, making all of it more rewarding and way less likely I'd get lazy and decide not to do it.

## Elusive Bodyfat

- The scale is one tool, and you should use it, but it is not king. It can mislead.
- Circumference: use a tape measure.
- Comparing: Just use one tool.
- Bio-impedance: Must be the same every day.
- Circumference measurements, use a tape measure.
- Evil fat: Beer bellies that seem as tight as a drum,

## From Photos to Fear

- How can people rationalize eating so much? He couldn't. I doubt he'd even tried.
- This is why you have to:
  - Make it conscious.
  - Make it a game.
  - Make it competitive.
  - Make it small and temporary.
- Try taking photos of all your meals before eating. Then show it to other people--"who wants to take a photo of a jumbo bag of M&Ms?" Not food diaries, but photos. Just this awareness alone will result in fat-loss.
- "Before" photos. Place them in an unavoidable spot.
- Measurement = motivation. The act of measuring is often more important than what you measure. You probably need to log just 5 times.
- Fear of loss, social comparison theory.
- Small and temporary.
  - "Do I really look like that in underwear?"
  - "Do I really eat that?"
  - "Who can I get to do this with me?"
  - "How do I measure up?"
  - "What is the smallest meaningful change I can make?"
- Things you can buy: fat replica.
- Check-in tool for the habit.
- Ignoring everyone: "Everyone has a damn opinion."
- The method, not the mechanism.
- Writing: Write one small sentence per day.
- If you want to walk an hour a day, don't start with one hour. Commit to a fail-proof five minutes instead.
- Doing nothing: actually, just knowing your weight everyday helps. Even without actually changing the "I eat what I want" and "no exercise", just logging down things helps.

## Subtracting Fat

- Rule 1: Avoid "white" carbohydrates. Not allowed: all bread, all rice, cereal potatoes, pasta, tortillas, fried food with breading. Don't eat white stuff unless you want to get fatter.
- Rule 2: Eat the same few meals over and over again.
  - Protein: Egg whites with 1-2 whole eggs for flavor, chicken, beef, fish, pork.
  - Legumes: Black beans, red beans, soybeans, pinto beans.
  - Vegetables: Spinach, mixed vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchi, asparagus, peas, broccoli, green beans.
  - Legumes are for caloric load.
- Rule 3: Don't drink calories.
  - No soft drinks, fruit juices, limit diet soft drinks to no more than 16 ounces as the aspartame can stimulate weight gain.
  - Red wines are allowed.
- Rule 4: Don't eat fruit.
  - Humans don't really need fruit. Exceptions are tomatoes and avocados. Seventh day, go peach crepes and banana bread until you go into a coma.
- Rule 5: Take on day off per week.
  - Spiking calories once a week ensures that your metabolic rake doesn't downshift from extended caloric restriction.

## The Slow-Carb Diet II

- Notepad: If I have a craving, I just added it to the list of things I was going to feast on during my regular cheat day. It's like deferred eating.
- Rotating 5-6 meals for a few weeks is not hard at all, even though you might imagine otherwise.
- Supplements:
  - Potassium, magnesium, calcium. 500 mg magnesium taken prior to bed will also improve sleep.
- Snacking: A bag of carrots. You can make Thai chicken basil with no rice.
- "I'll just have more vegetables instead of starch."
