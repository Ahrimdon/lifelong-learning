## Fasting & Programming
[Reference](https://dzone.com/articles/fasting-programming)

- Hunger: you get used to it after the first couple of days. The real struggle is thirst.
- Eat well, exercise, and don't skip meals to save time. 5 good hours are better than 10 bad ones.

### HN Comments

- One I'd got through the first day of starving hunger I felt great. As long as you have fat on your body you should be fine, however I'm not sure it would be a good idea if you are all muscle.
- Pros: no blood sugar swings, no hunger, fat loss, a real sense of achievement. Cons: greasy skin and zits.
- Do: keep exercising to prevent muscle loss, drink lots of liquid, eat something light if the starving hunger returns, talk to a doctor.
- Don't binge.
- Blood sugar spikes after each meal?
- "Low blood sugar": people misinterpreting their body. I used to get "low blood sugar" if I didn't eat for six hours or so, even getting headaches from it. People are jut so unused to being hungry that they freak out when it happens.
- Nowadays, we try to minimize our fat stores because overeating is a bigger threat to us than starvation is.

- IF: Skipping certain meals on purpose. Fasting for 16 hours and only eating within a specific 8-hour window.

  - Initial transition might be a jolt to the system as it was for me.
  - "Cognitive performance, activity, sleep, and mood are not adversely affected in health humans by two days of calorie-deprivation."

  - Just track your calorie intake in your meals to make sure you're not overeating. Portion control.
- Wake up, heavy strength training in a fasted state.
  - Consume 1/2 of my calories for the day.
  - Consume the second portion of my calories for the day in a big dinner.
