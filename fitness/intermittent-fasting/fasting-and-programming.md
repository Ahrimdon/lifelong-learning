## Fasting & Programming
[Reference](https://dzone.com/articles/fasting-programming)

- Hunger: you get used to it after the first couple of days. The real struggle is thirst.
- Eat well, exercise, and don't skip meals to save time. 5 good hours are better than 10 bad ones.

### HN Comments

- One I'd got through the first day of starving hunger I felt great. As long as you have fat on your body you should be fine, however I'm not sure it would be a good idea if you are all muscle.
- Pros: no blood sugar swings, no hunger, fat loss, a real sense of achievement. Cons: greasy skin and zits.
- Do: keep exercising to prevent muscle loss, drink lots of liquid, eat something light if the starving hunger returns, talk to a doctor.
- Don't binge.
- Blood sugar spikes after each meal?
- "Low blood sugar": people misinterpreting their body. I used to get "low blood sugar" if I didn't eat for six hours or so, even getting headaches from it. People are jut so unused to being hungry that they freak out when it happens.
- Nowadays, we try to minimize our fat stores because overeating is a bigger threat to us than starvation is.

- IF: Skipping certain meals on purpose. Fasting for 16 hours and only eating within a specific 8-hour window.
- During the fasted state, your body doesn't have a recently consumed meal to use as energy, so it is more likely to pull from the fat stored in your body as it's the only energy source readily available.
- Our bodies react to energy consumption with insulin production. The more sensitive your body is to insulin, the more likely you'll be able you use the food you consume efficiently.
- Meals following your workout will be stored most efficiently.
- Cavemen ate when they could, endured and dealt with long periods of not eating, and his body adapter to still function optimally enough to still go out and catch new food.
- Negative side effects?
  - Initial transition might be a jolt to the system as it was for me.
  - "Cognitive performance, activity, sleep, and mood are not adversely affected in health humans by two days of calorie-deprivation."
  - IF is not a panacea.
  - Just track your calorie intake in your meals to make sure you're not overeating. Portion control.
- Wake up, heavy strength training in a fasted state.
  - Consume 1/2 of my calories for the day.
  - Consume the second portion of my calories for the day in a big dinner.
  - Fast for 16 hours.
