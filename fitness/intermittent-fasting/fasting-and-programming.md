## Fasting & Programming
[Reference](https://dzone.com/articles/fasting-programming)

- Hunger: you get used to it after the first couple of days. The real struggle is thirst.
- Eat well, exercise, and don't skip meals to save time. 5 good hours are better than 10 bad ones.

### HN Comments

- One I'd got through the first day of starving hunger I felt great. As long as you have fat on your body you should be fine, however I'm not sure it would be a good idea if you are all muscle.
- Pros: no blood sugar swings, no hunger, fat loss, a real sense of achievement. Cons: greasy skin and zits.
- Do: keep exercising to prevent muscle loss, drink lots of liquid, eat something light if the starving hunger returns, talk to a doctor.
- Don't binge.
- Blood sugar spikes after each meal?
- "Low blood sugar": people misinterpreting their body. I used to get "low blood sugar" if I didn't eat for six hours or so, even getting headaches from it. People are jut so unused to being hungry that they freak out when it happens.
- Nowadays, we try to minimize our fat stores because overeating is a bigger threat to us than starvation is.

- IF: Skipping certain meals on purpose. Fasting for 16 hours and only eating within a specific 8-hour window.
- During the fasted state, your body doesn't have a recently consumed meal to use as energy, so it is more likely to pull from the fat stored in your body as it's the only energy source readily available.
- Our bodies react to energy consumption with insulin production. The more sensitive your body is to insulin, the more likely you'll be able you use the food you consume efficiently.
