# Creatine for road cyclists: how it works and how to take it
[Reference](https://cyclingtips.com/2016/09/creatine-for-road-cyclists-how-it-works-and-how-to-take-it/)

- Our muscles naturally contain creatine as part of the molecule creatine phosphate. This is a quick and easy supply of phosphate molecules which allow energy to be produces in our muscles very quickly.
- The supply of creatine phosphate is limited, so while it allows quick energy production, that supply can soon run low.
- Supplements aim to increase the amount of creatine phosphate stored in the muscle by around 20%. This extra store allows an athlete to produce max intensity efforts for a bit longer and more frequently, with shorter recovery periods in between.
- Benefits muscle size and strength, and some water retention improvements to tolerate the heat produced during high-intensity exercise.
- They are used by track sprinters.
- Good for building size and strength in the legs.
- For after a major injury, to prevent muscle loss.
- Slight weight gain, due to the fluid retained with it in the muscle.
- Up to 30% of people don't seem to respond to creatine supplements.
- To take: 20 grams per day for the first week, then drop to 3-5 grams a day moving forward.
- Otherwise, start off with 3-5 grams a day to maximize your muscle stores within about 4 weeks.
- 20g in one go can cause gastro-type symptoms, so go with 4 serves of 5 g each, spread out over the day.

# 10 Health and Performance Benefits of Creatine

- Helps muscle cells produce more energy. More ATP energy, which improves high-intensity exercise performance.
- Supports many other functions in muscles - adding muscle mass, increases the water content of muscles, and decreases level of myostatin, a molecule responsible for stunting muscle growth.
- Improves high-intensity exercise performance. Increases: strength, power, endurance, resistance to fatigue, muscle mass, recovery, brain performance.
- Speeds muscle growth.
- Reduce Parkinson's disease.
- Can fight other neurological diseases.
- May lower blood sugar levels and fight diabetes.
- Can improve brain function.
- May reduce fatigue and tiredness.
- Safe and easy to use.
