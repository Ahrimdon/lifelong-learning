## What Type Of Protein Is Best For You? 7 Forms Get Broken Down!
[Reference](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/protein-types-best-for-you.htm)

- *Whey concentrate.* Inexpensive, but some people find that they have a hard time digesting the concentrated and will end up feeling a little gassy and bloated. Can be used as a snack in between meals.
- *Casein.* This will breakdown over the course of several hours. Before bed, you can take in casein so you stay anabolic throughout the night and you are able to use the protein in your body. Takes 5-7 hours to fully breakdown which keeps your body absorbing and utilizing the nutrients even while you sleep. High glutamine content--boosts the immune system and speeds up recovery.
- *Whey isolate.* One of the quickest absorbing proteins, expensive, perfect for low carb diets. Many of the protein tubs on the market are strictly whey isolates that have low if any carbs/sugars.
- *Hydrolysate.* Most expensive, highest quality of protein, peptides that can be easily absorbed that can have a great anabolic effect. Better on the digestive system compared to whey concentrates.
- *Soy protein.* Good source of protein for those looking for a vegetarian source. Glutamine for recovery, arginine to dilate blood vessels, BCAAs to help with recovery. This speeds up metabolism which aids in fat loss. Not preferred to use at night.
- *Milk protein isolate.* Casein and whey proteins. Full of amino acids.
- *Egg whites.* Helps build lean muscle mass.

## Improve your recovery: the importance of protein for cyclists

- Optimum time to take in protein is either during or immediately after your ride as this is when your body will be seeking extra protein to repair itself.
- Casein is digested slowly.
- Post-ride protein should be around 20-25g, the weight of an average chicken breast.

## How protein helps your post-ride recovery

- Carbs might be the best riding fuel, but skimp on protein when the ride is over and your recovery will suffer.
- 80 grams per day for an 80kg rider.
- BCAA: Branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) make up one-third of muscle protein. During intense aerobic exercise they can be used as fuel by your muscles particularly when muscle glycogen is depleted.
- Studies suggest that supplementing your diet with BCAA during and after exercise may help reduce protein breakdown, preserving muscle and reducing muscle damage.

## The 3 Best Types of Protein for the Endurance Athlete

- Whey is a by-product of the cheese making process. Of the three BCAAs, Leucine has been shown to be the primary BCAA responsible for the stimulation of protein synthesis.
- Milk protein: decreases the prevalence of metabolic risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and mild hyperglycemia.
- Use a protein powder and use it as part of a post workout recovery fuel source that is properly balanced with carbohydrate-protein-fat.
